Henceforth "readers".The second are what we call technical/scifi readers. They skew compsci/engineering and technical documents. Henceforth "technicals" .
[00:47:52] <two2thehead> Readers are comfortable decrypting and jailbreaking books via software that is intuitively designed and has a GUI. Think calibre. Technicals can do the above and are comfortable with command line tools
[00:47:52] <two2thehead> All Technicals can easily upload books to libgen, while most Readers cannot.

[01:23:30] <meowcat> 'you can get fired for being very rude to your coworkers' is not a novel idea
[01:24:24] <pompolic> i don't disagree, I'm just being sarcastic about the rhetorical maneuvers involved 
[01:24:54] <pompolic> in fact i think it's a step down from general politeness norms in favor of a particular set of norms
[01:25:08] <meowcat> like, if you are a local construction firm and only employ local workers of a single class and predominant ethnicity for reasons that have nothing to do with bias and everything to do with 'most of the people who want to work in construction in california speak spanish' ... you don't have to worry about the diversities & the identities. but if you are a social media company who wants to appeal to the 
[01:25:14] <meowcat> world, you kinda do.
[01:25:48] <dbohdan> What counts as "very rude" varies by the target's estate
[01:26:15] <meowcat> partly because the engineers who are capable of building a social media platform are themselves from all over and have weird opinions and a bunch of them are gay or furry or poly or whatever.
[01:27:16] <meowcat> (i once conducted a tech interview where i discovered that the candidate was a furry, and they discovered that i was friendly to furries, because I asked where they'd programmed in Forth.)
[01:27:50] <pompolic> is there a deep connection between furries and forth?
[01:28:13] <Betawolf> you broke the... forth wall.
[01:29:05] <meowcat> Kind of. A lot of online furry roleplaying takes place on MUCK servers, e.g. FurryMUCK. MUCK can be scripted using MUF, which is a Forth dialect.
[01:29:30] <pompolic> oh, that does make sense
[01:30:58] <meowcat> to be honest, MUF and MPI (a Tcl-like language also used by MUCK) are way better than the predominant languages on non-MUCK MUD systems of similar vintage. TinyMUSH/PennMUSH scripting is a gross disaster.
[01:32:01] <meowcat> TBH if your Forth experience is on FurryMUCK and you put Forth on your resume, I expect you are okay with questions about it which may (coincidentally) touch on your furrydom.

[02:02:49] <kuudes> yeah, rarely there are roads that are safe for those speeds
[02:03:12] <kuudes> iirc over here they plan highways generally to 140 km/h but the speed limit is 120 km/h
[02:03:51] <kuudes> over here they reduced highway speed limit to 100 km/h because at 120 km/h limit many drove 140 km/h. at 100 km/h left lane seems to got 120 km/h, so pid tuning successful!

[02:55:17] <pompolic> sometimes the tags are "racist"
[02:55:37] <pompolic> but yeah
[02:55:45] <pompolic> i was thinking about PKMs/obsidian
[02:56:11] <pompolic> i think you can basically see clusters in thingspace on the graph view and that starts looking like a tag
[02:56:21] <pompolic> it remains to be seen whether this will hold for bigger graphs
[02:56:53] <pompolic> i think i just reinvented one of those neural networks
[02:57:18] <gwern> the way I imagine it is a bootstrap. you write stuff, it clusters, you define a 'tag' for a cluster, feed all the clusters' members in with tags to the model, etc
[02:57:23] <pompolic> classifiers, that's the word
[02:57:29] <gwern> this is what I intend to do with my link tagging approach
[02:57:51] <gwern> treat all the existing local docs/*.pdf as tagged (by the directory), and then apply that to all annotated URLs

[03:00:25] <gwern> it's pretty standard. that's how most large labeled datasets are created, when you aren't going 'yolo scrape the internet'

[03:01:16] <pompolic> i like that Obsidian works on top of markdown, because it seems easy to implement things like this on top of it
[03:01:40] <pompolic> s/markdown/textfiles
[03:06:12] <pompolic> one downside i see with directories as tags is that it forces you to fold it in one dimension, unless you can reach a file by multiple paths
[03:06:27] <gwern> pompolic: ah, but that's just to *start*
[03:06:30] <pompolic> i think i just reinvented xpath
[03:08:38] <pompolic> i guess folder hierarchies are just spanning trees of a graph?
[03:08:40] <gwern> pompolic: so let's say you have '/docs/cat/catnip/2010-foo.pdf'. there is in the yaml file a corresponding annotations: '- - /docs/cat/catnip/2010-foo.pdf \n - Catnip Correlation With Age \n - Foo, Bar \n - 2010-01-15 \n - DOI \n - catnip \n - We correlate catnip in 60 cats with gender and age; only age results are significant'. it starts with a single tag 'catnip' initialized from the path,...
[03:08:41] <galambo_> kuudes, ok maybe it was 180. I think my memory may have been 'they reached the top speed of the meter' rather than 'they reached 200kph'
[03:08:46] <gwern> ...but then it gets fed into the finetuned GPT-3 API, and it spits out 'TAGS: catnip, cat, age', say
[03:09:44] <gwern> * but while that's what it is in the training corpus, as just 1 tag, it gets fed into the finished model, which then suggests other useful tags, which the user then approves, updating the YAML entry to '- catnip, cat, age \n - We correlate...'
[03:09:56] <pompolic> oh no
[03:09:57] <gwern> and then that later gets fed in to the API for retraining, and so on
[03:10:08] <pompolic> does it ever stabilize?

[07:12:18] <gwern> shawwwn: because it's really easy to have a datacenter monkey walk by and stick in a usb stick compared to mounting a new hard drive, I'd guess, and 64GB can be a decent stopgap

[07:22:12] <gwern> so, do you want to pay $70/year for 20ms less latency? if you're just going to be serving bulk datasets off that box, I'd say that's not worth it. 20ms lower latency is not going to make any difference when you rsync down a few terabytes of furry smut
[07:22:56] <gwern> even if you serve your website off that, (a) you don't have any traffic so it doesn't matter and (b) you could proxy it through cloudflare or something which makes your endpoint latency irrelvant

[10:03:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Afghanistan is a country and Poland is *also* a country

[10:03:50] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: ah, so by the transitivity of equality...
[10:04:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Anyway the Poland digression seems like the dude was just kind of stream-of-consciousness-ing stuff that occurred to him as he was thinking about this stuff
[10:09:43] <nshepperd2> this kind of feels like an example of feminist talk about 'rape culture' causing people to lose sight of how bad actual rape cultures are
[10:11:12] <nshepperd2> i mostly agree with albatross11's reply though
[10:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also agree with that reply
[10:18:17] <rsaarelm> So the new End of Evangelion had no batshit End of Evangelion weirdness at all and just your run of the mill well-polished and immediately forgettable competently productivized summer blockbuster movie?
[10:19:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm watching "My Dinner With Andre" ... I'm like 2 minutes into the movie and (a) I was completely certain that the setting was NYC even before the voiceover confirmed it, despite not recognizing any landmarks in particular, and (b) god *damn* I forget sometimes what a shithole this place was in the 80s, in some ways
[10:20:02] <rsaarelm> Also wait why are Haruhi people already dead... Oh, right, the original character do not steal guy with the can of gasoline.
[10:20:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, some things, you can play up or down, right, but... subway cars *completely* covered in graffiti, inside and out? That's telltale
[10:28:26] <saturn2> rsaarelm: well... i guess it's "well-polished" in the sense that i have no idea what's going on, but there's a lot of CGI that would've been really impressive if i hadn't seen a million similar things before
[10:29:39] <rsaarelm> Yeah, but is it I have no idea what's going on like End of Evangelion was I have no idea what's going on, or is it just boring and incoherent?
[10:34:05] <saturn2> the action scenes are just michael bay style incomprehensible chaos
[10:35:51] <saturn2> numerous exposition dumps where a character unpromptedly delivers a monologue about what would've happened in the 3rd movie if they hadn't spent the entire time moping around and playing the piano
[10:39:40] <saturn2> at least someone kind of explains what the instrumentality project is
[10:40:37] <saturn2> it's lampshaded over and over that the new character has no purpose besides having the biggest boobs

[12:34:24] <quanticle> That makes sense: get all the child items of the current directory and filter it so that we only see the ones that are *not* containers

[12:36:06] <quanticle> Every day I'm more and more convinced that the two parts of the Unix philosophy: "small sharp tools" and "use plain text" are *diametrically* opposed
[12:36:29] <pie_> is the unix philosophy actually "use plain text"
[12:36:51] <pie_> oh youre a windows person? do you have any recommended resources

[12:37:56] <saturn2> :(
[12:38:06] <pie_> i just started pondering maybe taking a go at windows internals the other day, looks like the second part of the latest edition is coming out in september
[12:38:32] <quanticle> In Powwershell, that's literally just, Get-ChildItem | ?{!$_.IsContainer} | Sort-Object -Property "LastWriteTime"
[12:38:38] <quanticle> Er PowerShell
[12:39:06] <pie_> i wanted to try powershell from when i started trying to research typed pipes but now im interested
[12:39:30] <quanticle> Fuck, I might just install Powershell for Linux

[12:41:30] <quanticle> There are aliases, i.e. there is a default alias from Get-ChildItem to 'ls', for example, but I would recommend that you *don't* use them
[12:41:43] <quanticle> Because you'll end up typing something like 'ls -l' and it won't work
[12:41:53] <quanticle> Because Get-ChildItem has completely different options
[12:42:47] <pie_> where can I find docs for the linux version? apparently my package manager has it
[12:43:08] <quanticle> To be honest, I have no idea; I've never used PowerShell on Linux
[12:43:15] <saturn2> anyway, the unix philosophy was dumb and so was making everything plain text
[12:43:26] <quanticle> But I'm annoyed enough with bash that I'm seriously contemplating switching to a completely untested tool
[12:43:45] <pie_> saturn2: i never really studied the unix philosophy but i got the impression that it was about compositionality, and that doesnt seem dumb
[12:43:48] <pie_> whats the alternative
[12:43:49] <quanticle> I mean, making everything plain text is part of the Unix philosophy, so you've repeated yourself
[12:44:38] <saturn2> compositionality is great, just not the way unix does it
[12:45:39] <quanticle> The Unix philosophy, at least as it was passed to me, is "1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well. 2. Write programs to work together. 3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."
[12:45:39] <saturn2> unix only scored points by being the only mainstream option with any compositionality at all
[12:45:45] <quanticle> And 1 and 3 are opposed
[12:46:08] <quanticle> Because if you're writing programs to handle text streams, your program is going to have an entire text parser in it
[12:46:12] <quanticle> Whether you want it to or not
[12:46:30] <quanticle> And moreover, your program's text parser is going to be idiosyncratic, which blows up 2
[12:47:33] <pie_> hm
[12:48:15] <saturn2> having separate "programs" was an even worse idea
[12:48:43] <quanticle> Yeah, I mean, in PowerShell each command isn't really a separate program. It's more like a .Net class
[12:48:57] <quanticle> Which you can dynamically load either from a PowerShell script file or from a .dll
[12:49:13] * quanticle has written PowerShell functions in C#
[12:49:15] <nshepperd2> the real unix philosophy: "write programs that do one thing and do it well, and are all wrappers around jq"
[12:49:20] <saturn2> yet again, a shitty reinvention of a lisp machine
[12:49:31] <pie_> why are some people so good at shitposting
[12:49:39] <quanticle> saturn2: Yeah, but it's less shitty than bash
[12:49:54] <quanticle> Which you have to give Microsoft *some* credit for
[12:50:48] <quanticle> Anyway, bash gripes aside, I have to say, I don't hate the latest Ubuntu

[21:44:30] <ggreer> one thing I'd like to find stats on but can't seem to: how often immigrants are victims of crime in the US. my guess is that it's significantly more than native born
[21:45:17] <kuudes> iirc stat.fi has stat for that side
[21:46:37] <ggreer> I know it's not a random sample, but watching The First 48, out of probably 60 episodes I've seen a total of *one* native-born person who was minding their own business and got murdered. compare that to at least 6 where an immigrant was minding their own business and got murdered
[21:47:26] <ggreer> (the other 50something were drug deals gone bad, revenge for previous attacks, people having big egos and getting in fights, etc)

[21:47:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: ... lol
[21:51:14] <ggreer> btw the one native-born victim was a 70something woman who had a friend with a crazy ex-boyfriend. the boyfriend threatened to kill the girlfriend's friends unless she hooked up with him again. she didn't (and in fact got a protection order against him). so the guy did what he said. then he shot himself in the head as police moved in to capture him

As one joke tells it, Brezhnev is gifted with the latest in artificial intelligence, so he asks it “When will we have built communism?” The computer responds, “In 17 miles.” Brezhnev thinks, “There must be something wrong,” and repeats the question. The computer again replies, “In 17 miles.” Angered

[23:34:57] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Bata’s colloquies are intended for students to learn Latin through the use of dramatic scenes in which aspects of daily life in the classroom are played out: in a normal day, the master or his helper would give each pupil a passage of about 40 lines to memorise and recite back the following day, with the threat of a beating if this was not performed satisfactorily. As
[23:34:58] <feepbot> well as allowing students to play out the roles of teacher and student, or farmer or tradesman, Bata writes of monks throwing alcohol-fuelled parties, negotiating kisses from women, riding into town to get more beer and going to the privy with younger pupils, unaccompanied. His scenes often directly break the Benedictine rules to which Bata and his pupils were expected to adhere.
[23:34:58] <feepbot> In one colloquy, he sets out a dialogue between master and pupil in which they exchange a vast array of scatological insults, including the memorable ‘May a beshitting follow you ever’.' https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/inside-anglo-saxon-classroom

[23:56:00] <feepbot> <gwern> 'We explore the dependence of the singular value distribution on the depth of the network, the weight initialization, and the choice of nonlinearity. Intriguingly, we find that ReLU networks are incapable of dynamical isometry. On the other hand, sigmoidal networks can achieve isometry, but only with orthogonal weight initialization. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically
[23:56:00] <feepbot> that deep nonlinear networks achieving dynamical isometry learn orders of magnitude faster than networks that do not. Indeed, we show that properly-initialized deep sigmoidal networks consistently outperform deep ReLU networks' https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/d9fc0cdb67638d50f411432d0d41d0ba-Paper.pdf hm
