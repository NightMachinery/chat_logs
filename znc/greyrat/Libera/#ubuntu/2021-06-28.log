[00:03:11] <tomreyn> !16.04 | Guest46: you might already be aware of this (?)
[00:03:11] <ubottu> Guest46: you might already be aware of this (?): Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) was the 24th release of Ubuntu. !End-of-life was April 30th, 2021. Paid support (ESM) is available. See also !esm, !eol, !eolupgrade
[00:04:12] <Guest46> I did not know that, it's not my daily driver.  I'd like to update to 20.04 LTS. Can I update from the ISO without losing data?

[00:05:55] <Guest46> I don't follow you, oerheks.  Should I expect trouble updating from an end of life distribution following its prompt?
[00:06:14] <oerheks> Guest46, you already took that risk, upgrading to 18.04...
[00:06:21] <tomreyn> a segfault during initrd generation isn't a great indication on a stable system, though.

[00:08:50] <Guest46> tomreyn, can you make a couple of reasonable guesses as to the reason for the segfault?  You seem to know your stuff.
[00:09:47] <tomreyn> not really, i don't know anything about this system other than what you told us so far. chances are that the ubuntu installation is in a bad state becuase unsupported changes were applied.

I'm thinking step back and punt - boot with SysRescueCD and try to recover data onto a flash drive, then do a fresh install.  Does that sound like a good plan?
[00:12:35] <quantum> I am suspecious that something has changed with the default encryption or whatever, is there any way to tell what is going on

[00:15:19] <tomreyn> quantum: there should be a script called "ecryptfs-recover-private" or similar which you could possibly use to recover the data
[00:16:54] <quantum> yeah, maybe, I guess I just don't understand what is wrong. maybe there is something besides the key I type in that is needed. I copied my old home folder so I should have everything
[00:17:06] <quantum> if I need to copy some files
[00:17:16] <tomreyn> Guest46: a reboot may fail because the initrd didn't seem to generate properly. you might be able to boot an earlier kernel image + initrd, if you havw one, but i'd rather ssh a second time and see if i can recover any data before meoving towards a reboot.
[00:17:45] <tomreyn> (and check dmesg there, too, on the other shell)
[00:17:48] <oerheks> quantum, make sure that share is unmounted before upgrading .. not sure the mint way is going to do what you want

[00:25:36] <tomreyn> Guest46: :) But not a whiole lot of Linux, yet, I guess. Npow how do we resolve this? Maybe the easiest thing you could do is to install Ubuntu on another computer or VM and then attach the storage of this one to it so that you can recover your data?
[00:27:23] <tomreyn> Most file systems from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS are still supported in 20.04 LTS, so this should probably work - unless there are hardware problems or the file system has become corrupted beyond repair.

[00:27:57] <Guest46> tomreyn... so, ssh would be the connection to download the 18.04 update?  I think the machine finished that download before installing, then ran into trouble.  Yah, I think that's a good plan to use a different machine to try to recover the data.  Maybe this old beast's motherboard/CPU is going funky.

[02:07:30] <gsker> But if your problem is the driver for the USB network and it doesn't work under an already configured system, then you might have some specific questions....

[08:27:49] <mehmet> what do you need'
[08:29:19] <stefan-tmp-livec> Hi wonderful people!   I have a Problem.   I did an update from groovy -> hirsute last night via do-release-upgrade, and I've broken anything gnome-ish:  Setting up ibus (1.5.24-1) ...
[08:29:20] <stefan-tmp-livec> dconf: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_memdup2
[08:30:36] <stefan-tmp-livec> Anyone have any thoughts about how I can recover?   Currently booted/chrooted from livecd, because things like wifi / keyboard (in X11) don't work.
[08:32:31] <guy_frm_yogaland> @mehmet: I am learning docker on ubuntu and using a dockerfile there, find error at the step for npm install, it shows permission denied error and asks me to do that as root user

[08:35:24] <guy_frm_yogaland> @mehmet: I have created a new system user called app and assigned it to a group called app, and when I set the user to app in the dockerfile, and then build -> it says permission error, use root and I don't want to run a container as root user, what should I do now?

[23:45:07] <oerheks> that is what you claim, writing without mount.
[23:45:23] <TJ-> chrfle: you can control the amount of caching, and policy, vis sysctl. See e.g. "sysctl -a | grep dirty"
