[00:00:03] <absentia> your code is a list
[00:00:04] <ski> ProfSimm : yes, it's called "dependent vs. independent variables". like `y = f(x)', then `d y / d x'. `x' is dynamically scoped, in the definition of `y'. if it wasn't, then `d y / d x' would be `0'
[00:00:06] <absentia> do whatever you want with it
[00:00:14] <ProfSimm> ski: yes. I've been thinking about this. Maybe we can have a boundary up to which we permit this. My goal is to have everything actor-oriented. Actors talk to each other in async way although it's designed to look like sync calls. But there are also sync calls where the actor is running the calls itself.
[00:00:35] <ProfSimm> ski: maybe set the boundary at async. Two actors can't mess with each other, but calls in an actor from an actor is fair game
[00:00:48] <ProfSimm> ski: so it depends if you load a library in another actor or in yourself

[01:26:54] <ProfSimm> Does anyone have a solution for the "null terminated string" problem where a string could contain null in the middle of the string. Note my question is not about strings per se (the solution there is to simply save length). But more about streams of things with the same issue. You need to know when the stream ends, but that same symbol can be in the stream
[01:27:02] *** Quits: ejjfunky (~ejjfunky@125.164.17.25) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:27:45] <inhahe_> i can only think of escaping that symbol or signaling end of stream out of band
[01:27:49] <ejjfunky2> ProfSimm, why have a null at all? eliminate null from strings.
[01:27:53] <bud> on streams you don't look for null you look for end of file?
[01:27:58] <flakland> if your string contains null in the middle then you're definitely doing it wrong
[01:28:43] <ProfSimm> We look for the end of file, but this implies we have a separate method to ask if we're at eof
[01:28:52] <ProfSimm> Or a symbol for it
[01:29:30] <bud> i think if this is important, or string handling in general maybe don't use C.
[01:29:32] <ejjfunky2> if you want to do it that way, just do it as really literal, no mixed strings

[01:30:30] <bud> if the string actually can contain and is allowed to contain null, then there must be a way to escape that before you parse it.
[01:30:43] <bud> and if null is the terminating character
[01:30:47] <inhahe_> oh and a third option: send your stream in chunks each with a length
[01:30:47] <ProfSimm> We have 1) encoding length /not suitable for unknown length streams/  2) escaping symbol (good but means extra burden on reading)

[01:32:11] <ejjfunky2> ProfSimm, we can have the extra burden, we are'nt running on 14.4k anymore
[01:32:48] <flakland> what purpose does the NULL serve ?
[01:32:54] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky2: we can for network, but not if we decide to use that stream primitive for everything. Like interprocess communication, even in-process communication

[01:33:27] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky2: "no mo stufz"
[01:34:32] <flakland> if it's just a stream EOF, then create a boundary at the stream_read call

[01:34:52] <Guest13> I thought a \0 in a string meant the end of the string

[01:36:19] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky2: in a language with unique symbols you can do this:   read(eof-symbol-i-provide) and if you get this symbol you know it's eof, because you made the symbol and it's unique, the stream can't contain it

[01:39:28] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: if you have unicode i guess you'd have to use a unicode character that doesn't exist
[01:39:33] <KillerWasp> In a communication protocol that is only text (0~127 in ASCII), if no 10 or 0 arrives as a byte, the line may be endless. The same if the protocol is binary, which needs some means to end a command, in my case I am using a default size at the beginning of the command.

[04:17:53] <flakland> mutable = non-constant
[04:19:10] <inhahe_> seems like the better question is how do you define stateful
[04:19:41] <ProfSimm> I'm just scraping for a word for mutability that doesn't sound like something out of a Sci-Fi channel horror flick
[04:19:45] <flakland> constant = inVariable
[04:20:16] <flakland> mutable = variable
[04:20:34] <flakland> any questions?
[04:21:02] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: stateful is contextual I guess. Because it requires separation of "stages". I.e. if you stop a program and run it again if it loses state, it was stateful. There's persistent state, so now we need to extend this to also mean "if we delete cache and database files, etc."
[04:21:14] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: so stateful means basically "things not in the source code"

[04:46:53] <ejjfunky2> how about ocha or matcha?
[04:46:53] <ProfSimm> flakland: because branching is a direct outcome of the comparison, there's no intermediate boolean value that leads to it
[04:47:02] <flakland> if you are testing  "if negative" thats a boolean, "if x < 0"  it resolves to TRUE or FALSE
[04:47:06] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@ip5b42976d.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)

[04:47:27] <ejjfunky2> ahh ok
[04:47:58] <ProfSimm> flakland: it resolves to true or false in your high-end language with this built-in enum true/false. It resolves by jumping to the part of the code that assigns the right bool value to your variable. This is like miles above the assembler code or the machine code.

[04:48:36] <ProfSimm> flakland: so it's not that the machine code uses bool values to jump. It's the exact opposite. It jumps to set the righ bool value in Java or whatever you use
[04:48:38] <flakland> at what point does that description not use boolean values
[04:48:39] *** Joins: potatoxel[m] (~potatoxel@2001:470:69fc:105::f026)

[04:49:27] <flakland> yeah thats a sane argument.
[04:49:30] <flakland> lunacy
[04:49:42] <ProfSimm> flakland: I literally just explained how your description doesn't fit. Your description:    x > y --> boolean result --> jump    reality:   x > y ---> jump --> (java semantics) map to boolean enum

[04:54:37] <amigojapan> Np
[04:54:41] <ProfSimm> flakland: I know what it represents. But just because you're used to thinking about comparisons producing boolean values, doesn't make it true. It doesn't produce boolean values. It jumps to arbitrary code

[06:40:33] <ProfSimm> There should be a built in translation feature. You get opaque nameless symbols, and there's a table for each language mapping it to a name
[06:40:56] <ejjfunky> exactly. a dictionary.
[06:41:22] <ProfSimm> The problem is when two words are the same in one language (overloaded), and not the same in another.

[12:04:04] <xeno> Decker: powershell is not lisp.. it's more of... well... a total mess
[12:04:04] <epony> the reality is the opposite, Lisp is a trailing language family that collects features form other languages as Lisp-dialects
[12:04:16] <lockywolf_> #lang shell

[12:05:08] <xeno> epony: the first lisp was somewhat first - for later ones the useful way of viewing them is as human-interactable AST's 
[12:05:23] <epony> meh, it was not quite a language back then
[12:05:44] <xeno> nothing was quite a language until there was enough languages around for the term to make sense 
[12:06:06] *** jazzy2 is now known as jazzy
[12:06:10] <epony> technically, languages start before that, and continue appearing
[12:06:24] <xeno> I would claim it was more of a language than e.g. Fortran... but maybe because Fortran being a war crime overshadows every other aspect of it 
[12:06:25] <epony> the programming does not start with "lisp"
[12:06:56] <xeno> programming started with a 2 item todo list, or maybe just one 
[12:07:30] <xeno> someone paining a mammoth on the cave wall to remind themselves to go out and kill a mammoth in the morning
[12:07:34] <epony> well, it is just counters, but it start with stored instructions and values, then machine code and instruction sets and then moves onto data structures and algorithms and you know the rest

[12:10:12] <xeno> ski: yeah - which, as is custom with most famous people, probably means that someone else was the first programmer and she had her signatures all over it :)
[12:10:19] <epony> different times, different computer capacities, different needs of people, some presumptions and time trials.. nothing wrong with non-separated system and interpreter language features, it just gets improved / discarded over time
[12:10:57] <epony> that is EXACTLY the same problem as Lisp machines having the same language features for system and scripting
[12:11:04] <epony> an inefficiency, that gets resolved

[14:12:52] <callq> How can I divide -> round/truncate -> sum, such that the sum is again equal to the original dividend?
