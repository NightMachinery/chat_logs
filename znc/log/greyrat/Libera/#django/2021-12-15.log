[05:32:03] <iiie_> Hello!  I just fixed my marginally customized search for the admin.  I believe the documentation for customizing search in the admin is incorrect.
[05:32:13] <iiie_> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_search_results
[05:34:09] <iiie_> The doc example takes what was there (queryset) and ors it with the model object filtered for the search term.  If the queryset is filtered, the filters are ignored.
[05:35:58] <iiie_> I worked around this for my use-case by not overwriting the queryset variable (used qs instead), and used |= on the original queryset filtered for age=search_term_as_in in the example.

[11:48:46] <pycode1> hello everybody
[11:49:45] <pycode1> i have to insert a giant csv in db, i need to process every rows make some changes and then insert into db, the rows are 100M so create a transaction with 100M does not sound very good :F what is a reasonable batch size to create transactions ?
[11:50:49] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[12:00:32] <ktosiek[m]> depends on what other traffic you have on that database, if it's only for initial import I'd first generate a new CSV with the data in importable format and then COPY it all at once.

[12:33:55] <gulzar> as ktosiek[m] said, create a new csv will be better for such large size

[19:27:42] <pycode1> i can see if all the instances of the batch have a unique timestamp i can do that but as i wrote an integrityerror could happen if the record already exists (or if it has been inserted in previous batche)

[19:28:13] <GinFuyou> but you can exclude it from the batch if you can check it

[19:28:48] <pycode1> GinFuyou, i can check in the 256 instances but the record maybe has been inserted in previous batch
[19:28:58] <pycode1> so to fix that problem i should hold a list with everything
[19:29:09] <pycode1> but as i wrote holding a list of 10M instances is not so good
[19:29:34] <GinFuyou> if it was inserted in previous batch you can check against db which doesn't require holding data in memory

[20:17:55] <ojno> hi there all, I've just been made aware of CVE-2021-44420, the one about the trailing newlines, I was wondering if there was a PoC for a way someone could exploit this? I'm struggling to see the impact and I'm trying to work out whether this affects my site in any way ^_^;

[21:56:01] <theprophet> you are right but, i dont understand whats the problem GinFuyou
[21:58:24] <GinFuyou> well, on image shown problem is most likely what I said above
[21:58:39] <GinFuyou> so, check your resulting urls first of all
[21:58:57] <theprophet> GinFuyou tell me one thing. how do i display everything on page in templates?
[21:59:00] <theprophet> you saw the code
[21:59:04] <theprophet> i erased previous one
[21:59:08] <theprophet> what was in templates
[21:59:28] <theprophet> and now i dont want to use js anymore
[21:59:47] <theprophet> it had design now i dont want it, and i want it without CSS and js
[21:59:56] <theprophet> but how do i display it now
[22:00:37] <theprophet> what should i write in templates {{}} so i can see my function which i created in views.
[22:03:28] <GinFuyou> theprophet, oh, wait you were using JS for form submit? Why?
[22:04:00] <theprophet> so i could make it beautiful
[22:04:15] <GinFuyou> "beautiful"?
[22:04:25] <theprophet> well, its a chain reaction
[22:04:35] <theprophet> i was watching some video tutorial and then i followed it
[22:04:38] <theprophet> and then i did js too
[22:04:56] <GinFuyou> just remove the JS part
[22:05:02] <theprophet> i removed yes
[22:05:11] <GinFuyou> it has nothing to do with beauty
[22:05:55] <theprophet> can you tell me how to display my views.py in web?
[22:06:11] <theprophet> which values i should pick here
[22:06:26] <theprophet> sorry not values
[22:06:27] <theprophet> variables
[22:06:53] <theprophet> i remember that its {{}} <-- this brackets and then words inside
[22:07:00] <GinFuyou> perfectly you would just use form, but you are not using it. For now it should just work
[22:07:33] <theprophet> yes but, when i delleted that js subbmit thing
[22:07:39] <theprophet> now i cant see nothing
[22:07:53] <theprophet> which means i need to display views.py in page
[22:07:55] <theprophet> no?
[22:07:59] <GinFuyou> return the html part
[22:08:33] <GinFuyou> > display views.py in page - it's not a correct wording, django is not PHP
[22:09:06] <GinFuyou> You normally show html from HttpResponse. Which is usually a rendered django template. (in simple cases)
[22:09:09] <theprophet> what is the correct desription for such django?
[22:09:17] <theprophet> i see
[22:09:50] <GinFuyou> but for a simple form... just static code with csrf_token is enough
[22:10:55] <GinFuyou> ah I see, you don't render your template
[22:11:39] <GinFuyou> Check the official tutorial on templates
[22:12:00] <theprophet> ok to show you i returned everything i delleted

[23:44:22] <theprophet> also i changed fields in model and now in database they have different name
[23:45:40] <GinFuyou> naming things better is helpful. But it's not about actual logic.
[23:47:49] <GinFuyou> For example i'd call model something like UrlPair or UrlMapping. Since it's not an url, it's an object that maps a shortened url to a long url, and has both as it's attributes (fields)
