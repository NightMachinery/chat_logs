[00:59:52] <PublicWiFi> fuck oracle
[00:59:55] <Hunterkll> now, they could just drop it and stop shipping builds, but then you can just switch to Oracle, AWS, Apache, Eclipse's, etc's build
[01:00:11] <PublicWiFi> openjdk makes me happy
[01:00:14] <Hunterkll> the usage of 'long-term' here is not defined or created by microsoft
[01:00:17] <PublicWiFi> AWS build master race
[01:00:24] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: OpenJDK is run by oracle and is the reference implementation for the Java standard
[01:00:28] <PublicWiFi> yeah i know lol

[01:00:54] <PublicWiFi> s/people/companies and groups
[01:00:56] <layer8> PublicWiFi meant: "quite a few companies and groups maintain it though"
[01:01:08] <Hunterkll> you mean they take the oracle source repo and build it themselves

[01:01:44] <mistiry> iphone: use strace
[01:01:47] <Hunterkll> @bdenlinger but yes, in this case, the definition of long-term isn't from microsoft at all, it's the oracle support lifecycle for that release
[01:01:58] <Hunterkll> and MS's build is 100% compatible with everyone elses, no extensions etc
[01:02:18] <Hunterkll> pretty sure they're primarily doing it for ensuring ARM support for all their products that use java 
[01:02:27] <Hunterkll> and ARM windows adoption 
[01:02:29] <Hunterkll> either way 
[01:02:40] <iphone> strace (rather dtruss because MacOS) didn't want to work
[01:02:47] <Hunterkll> I haven't seen MS alter a "long term" support length for a released product.... ever 
[01:03:09] <Hunterkll> they've released some with shortened lifecycles, but those were upfront
[01:03:23] <Hunterkll> only thing they've ever really done is retroactively extend some lifecycles 
[01:04:05] *** Quits: Cleverness (~clevernes@pool-108-54-152-186.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:05:03] <Hunterkll> the major thing that MS has done is a lot of ARM legwork in java ports for all the platforms - then submitted the code upstream. They'll make/develop changes internally, submit them to oracle, but they won't be included in the MS JDK release *until* oracle commits them in the upstream codebase
[01:05:32] <Hunterkll> unless it's a glaring issue/performance killer
[01:05:36] <a1> ARM legwork
[01:05:36] <a1> harhar
[01:05:37] <Hunterkll> but even then, still TCK compliant 
[01:05:58] <Hunterkll> every change still gets upstreamed to oracle so that every JDK version gets it 
[01:06:38] <CoJaBo> Whelp, I banned a customer for murder today. I think that's probably a first, so there's that
[01:06:56] <sd> 09<H​aise> Ayo what

[01:07:12] <Hunterkll> But they're doing their own spin for the same reason that Amazon is -> https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/
[01:07:29] <CoJaBo> (I don't actually have proof the person who said this product killed wasn't itself a hoax; it's one of those medical hoax product sites)
[01:07:47] <a1> it's just murder nothing serious
[01:07:49] <vinrock> huh
[01:08:43] <CoJaBo> It's unhinged enough that I'll soon know if it was real or not, cuz it's gonna be on the news if so <_<
[01:09:08] <vinrock> still have no idea what youre talkin bout
[01:09:09] <Hunterkll> which is both ensuring continuity of support, and deploying fixes to their own internal products (Azure/AWS, etc) faster than waiting for the next release and oracle to fix a bug 
[01:09:10] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:09:11] <vinrock> who killed who

[01:10:53] <vinrock> ahhh one of those
[01:10:54] <vinrock> gotha
[01:11:00] <vinrock> i was hopin for a dead body

[01:11:23] <Hunterkll> :D
[01:11:36] <CoJaBo> The complaint that came in is that the customer died shortly after taking the product, as would be expected. Tho we can't confirm that's not itself a lie/exaggeration
[01:11:47] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: In this case, we are certain the product would kill

[03:16:33] * gibby kicks Activ8 from the channel 
[03:16:44] <Activ8> lol
[03:17:11] <Hunterkll> @Danx you have two problems here - first is that it'll probably prefer 8.8.8.8 if it's set as the alternate over ipv4
[03:17:19] <Hunterkll> second is that the router is handing you IPv6 dns link-local information 
[03:17:30] <Hunterkll> first, you solve by only having the DNS server you want to use and nothing else
[03:17:42] <Hunterkll> second, go into IPv6 settings, change DNS to use the following dns server addresses, and leave both fields blank 
[03:18:10] <Hunterkll> the REAL proper fix would be to set up a DNS forwarder for whatever domain you're serving locally, and using the router's DNS forwarder, but depending on router you have that may not be possible
[03:18:28] <Activ8> well yeh you could configure the dns in the router
[03:19:35] <Hunterkll> Right now, you have *three* DNS servers specified on the system, and windows will always default to IPv6 first (since a large part of XP/2k3 and hard since Vista/Server 2008)

[03:23:01] <Hunterkll> i'm tryina figure out where WAN came into this at all

[03:23:17] <Hunterkll> ^ I was talkin' bout that
[03:23:34] <Hunterkll> so it doesn't use an IPv6 DNS server (hopefully whatever you're using as a DNS server is returning IPv6 records, though, otherwise .... lol)
[03:23:42] <signofzeta> well, those IPv6 DNS servers have got to be coming from somewhere.  I'm late to the party, so I missed the fact-finding.
[03:23:58] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: so far the fix was for him to turn off ipv6 on a nic, and he's on an ipv6 native network lol
[03:24:12] <Hunterkll> he's also got 8.8.8.8 in his DNS config too
[03:24:17] <Hunterkll> which is gonna break shit for internal resolution as well
[03:24:27] <Hunterkll> windows likes to switch up which it uses randomly
[03:24:30] <Hunterkll> kind of a bitch really
[03:24:57] <xe0n> such rounded corners
[03:25:13] <signofzeta> Try doing "backup" DNS in an AD environment.  It does not work.
[03:25:14] <xe0n> LOL he has the nic set to 8.8.8.8
[03:25:14] <xe0n> HA
[03:25:25] <xe0n> GOOGLE WHATS THE DNS RECORD FOR THE SERVER ACROSS THE ROOM
[03:25:25] <Hunterkll> xe0n: he's got his internal AND 8.8.8.8 set 
[03:25:29] <xe0n> "im feeling lucky"
[03:25:32] <xe0n> LOL!
[03:25:32] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:25:43] <xe0n> no wonder shit is busted
[03:25:53] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: well, in this case, you use DNS appliances/forwarding systems that work properly, and do DNS forwarders to your AD domain 
[03:25:55] <Hunterkll> problem solved
[03:25:55] <sd> 13<C​olour> I mean 8.8.8.8 is the second one
[03:26:01] <xe0n> yeah it shouldn't be

[03:26:07] <signofzeta> Windows doesn't always respect the order.
[03:26:12] <Hunterkll> @Colour and windows will sometimes flip to it, or use the secondary by default

[03:27:30] <sd> 13<C​olour> Heh
[03:27:31] <signofzeta> nslookup is a name server testing tool.  It does not always respect Windows, NRPT, DNSSEC, or other black magic.
[03:27:43] <Hunterkll> wut
[03:27:54] <Hunterkll> that's.... it gets the current DNS server windows is preferring.... unles you manually specify 
[03:28:26] <signofzeta> yeah, but it doesn't do advanced stuff like NRPT (DNS forwarders at a GPO level), DNSSEC checking, and other topics.  It's strictly a name server testing tool.
[03:28:39] <signofzeta> which defaults to the first DNS server configured, whether that's the one Windows has decided to use or not.

[03:33:44] <Hunterkll> @Danx i'd flip this thing into bridge mode and get yourself a competent router if you're gonna start fucking with stuff like this, or just force the client machines configuration by manually specifying blank DNS servers for IPv6

[03:35:50] <Activ8> Nice to see you, to see you nice!
[03:35:59] <Hunterkll> i just have a dumb access terminal and an edgerouter handling the real work 
[03:36:12] <Hunterkll> edgerouter forwards all corp.domain.com to the domain controllers for all the custom DNS and AD stuff 
[03:36:26] <Hunterkll> but otherwise just passes through to external DNS servers for anything that doesn't fall under that domain 
[03:36:35] <Hunterkll> this router unfortunately does not have that option, it seems
[03:37:18] <Hunterkll> (which, is the preferred setup for this kind of thing so in case your server is busted or whatever, the internet doesn't stop working for anything/everyone else)

[04:33:39] <JollyRgrs> SleePy: it's prob just playing KSP all day
[04:33:41] <SleePy> I was mostly thinking rockets about 6 ft tall.  Hit a couple thousand feet.  Not the ones that stand maybe a foot tall and only go a hundred feet or so
[04:34:15] <Hunterkll> huh, looks like all the non-AP programming stuff is gone
[04:34:36] <Hunterkll> hah they have a forensics class too
[04:34:39] <SleePy> Does it integrate with the local community college?  Might only offer them if you go through that
[04:34:46] <JollyRgrs> my youngest is going to start a programming class this year (homeschool)
[04:34:55] <Hunterkll> nope
[04:35:12] <SleePy> That sucks.  Our schools have done that for years.
[04:35:40] <Hunterkll> the local high end magnet school is near the college
[04:35:43] <Hunterkll> i guess they get priority
[04:35:43] <Hunterkll> :p
[04:35:50] <SleePy> When I did it, you travelled to the community college for your college classes, which also where credit for your high school classes.  Now they have a deeper integration and you can take college classes at the high school
[04:35:58] <Hunterkll> one of those fancy public schools that you have to apply to and do trade routes and/or things like that 
[04:36:00] <JollyRgrs> that's dual enrollment
[04:36:14] <SleePy> I know some kids who graduated high school with a 2 year college degree and 0 debt because the state paid for it
[04:36:17] <Hunterkll> iirc in my time, they got you your A+ up to some cisco certs by the time you finished 
[04:36:20] <JollyRgrs> i woulda MUCH rather had dual enrollment than AP, but my school just did AP... the schools get money for everyone who passes AP
[04:36:21] <Hunterkll> for the computer course
[04:36:24] <Hunterkll> but
[04:36:32] <Hunterkll> when i toured the place on an open house and asked questions
[04:36:34] <Hunterkll> it was literally
[04:36:39] <Hunterkll> "wow........ this place is retarded"
[04:36:59] <Hunterkll> in the "holy shit I legitimately know more about this than the instructor introducing the course offerings " kind of way 
[04:37:23] <Hunterkll> then again, first year you end up with an A+ cert at the end... end of grade 12 you had some entry level cisco crap ....
[04:37:47] <Hunterkll> would have been better off doing the after school *actual* cisco courses at the other highschool (not the one i went to, but not the fancy one) and learned more in like 6 months....
[04:37:57] <SleePy> I much rather enjoy the college credit while in high school.  Take a "AP" level class and it counts as a math credit towards my degree and towards graduation.  Was a win win
[04:38:02] <Hunterkll> but i ended up chosing mine because they had a competent programming teacher
[04:39:01] <Hunterkll> at least they still teach the same three langauges 
[04:39:05] <Hunterkll> (german, french, spanish)
[04:39:37] <SleePy> I guess I'm just happy that my nephew gets opportunities I never had in school to learn IT stuff.  Great progress on public education
[04:40:14] <Hunterkll> kinda wish they had some of these - there's a lot more engineering geared stuff now 
[04:40:29] <Hunterkll> like, electric logic/circuits (including documentation apparently!)
[04:40:39] <SleePy> Although its funny, the college and high school offer hvac classes.. Because we have datacenters like crazy out here.  Facebook, Microsoft, Google, T-Mobile, VM-Ware, and Yahoo to name the ones I can think of
[04:40:39] <Hunterkll> basic engineering design/CAD/etc 
[04:41:13] <Hunterkll> there's AP comp sci stuff (comp sci & comp sci principles) for grades 10 to 12
[04:41:23] <Hunterkll>  tho comp sci (not the principles one) requires alg 2 complete beforehand
[04:41:51] <JollyRgrs> ugh, here goes Hunterkll asking his HW questions in the chat again, can someone pls tell him to go google for himself. SHEESH!

[05:50:27] <Hunterkll> xe0n: gibby - bets on when yuken will qualify for SSDI? (Social Security Disability Income)
[05:50:44] <Jaelae> It’s a bit specific so most would charge a lot more so I might be hold off and stay firm on my rate
[05:50:46] <Hunterkll> i'm going with permanent loss of limb
[05:51:23] <misspwn> ok well how about this, can you live without this project? if so stay firm
[05:51:29] <misspwn> i'm sorry but my rate is this
[05:51:34] <misspwn> actually do not apologize
[05:51:49] <gibby> Hunterkll: 20 days
[05:52:07] <Hunterkll> generous of you
[05:52:23] <yuken> lol Hunterkll, fuck off.
[05:52:26] <gibby> figure it takes some time after getting out of the hospital to qualify

[10:40:35] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: OMG so my daughter is going to learn some coding for school this year.... she's gonna be learning via Scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564010427/
[10:40:51] <JollyRgrs> check out what you can do with it! lol
[10:41:54] <Work-BWMerlin> Anyone have any experience with WAMP and allowing standard users to run it?
[10:42:28] <JollyRgrs> you want std users to run WAMP? are these like windows devs i assume?
[10:42:28] <Work-BWMerlin> I tired this tick and it didn't work https://superuser.com/questions/440544/how-to-start-wampserver-without-providing-administrator-privileges
[10:42:52] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes Windows devices.  Students use WAMP for what ever it is they do with WAMP
[10:43:12] <JollyRgrs> ah
[10:43:12] <Work-BWMerlin> I *think* the issues is my scheduled task isn't an admin so I might need a limited admin account for it
[10:43:27] <JollyRgrs> so do they need to own the process or just simply have a way to (re)start it?
[10:44:15] <Work-BWMerlin> There are three processes (mysql, mariadb and apache) which I have pushed out a GPO which allows all students to start, stop and restart these services
[10:44:28] <Work-BWMerlin> But the console still asks for admin which is where I tried the above link
[10:45:25] <Work-BWMerlin> I *think* I need to set the schedule task to run as an admin user rather than a standard user but unsure how to do that in a way which won't allow a student to then privilege escalate that
[10:45:28] <JollyRgrs> i'd love to try and help (this is something i am usually decent at helping to solution)... but it's 2:15 and I have a bet with my wife that i'll lose if I take a nap anytime this week

[16:21:39] <xe0n> Mark_Pinecone: then dont fight with them, organise a meeting and get everyone on the same page, a process needs to be changed\included to do what you want
[16:21:48] <xe0n> stop saying yolo, you're in your 30s

[16:21:55] <sd> 02<r​yalln> haha never
[16:21:55] <xe0n> LOL
[16:21:57] <teh_f4ll3n> that is the only feasible way to test code - so many free beta testers
[16:22:53] <teh_f4ll3n> YOLO is not used how it should be most of the time

[16:23:15] <teh_f4ll3n> it used to stand for "you get to live once, make it count"
[16:23:41] <teh_f4ll3n> now it means "you only live once, do stupid shit"
[16:23:48] <estranger> sometimes you can't test everything exactly in pre prod ie can't synthesize your data exactly... buts that's why you have a prodfix environment, riiiiiight?
[16:23:59] <sd> 02<r​yalln> ^^ this
[16:24:21] <xe0n> or a UAT environment where you can simulate production workloads
[16:24:26] <xe0n> ...we do it with a few things lol
[16:24:42] <estranger> "sometimes you can't test everything exactly in pre prod ie can't synthesize your data exactly.."
[16:24:47] <xe0n> i.e. our MIM db and what not is replicated to UAT, can do whatever you want in there, validate, have it approved, put it into prod
[16:25:29] <estranger> sometimes you can't use production data in non prod, or can't predict exactly how users will behave
[16:25:48] <xe0n> true, so you can do dummy data etc...there's ways to test and get a good idea of the outcome in prod
[16:25:52] <sd> 02<r​yalln> users will find a way to break shit 😄
[16:26:07] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, but... not packaging critical libs...
[16:26:15] <xe0n> yeah process fail there
[16:26:16] <xe0n> lol
[16:26:19] <estranger> so qa/uat looks good then you go to prod and go wtf are users doing?
[16:26:46] <teh_f4ll3n> that's why I said "so many beta testers" :D
[16:26:55] <estranger> dummy data is not often the same as production
[16:27:07] <xe0n> sure... but you can still test these things jeez
[16:27:14] <xe0n> anyway..
[16:27:23] <teh_f4ll3n> can't replicate 1D10T in prod

[16:27:40] <sd> 02<r​yalln> things ive learnt, people can put in manual fixes not document then and your automate can break shit when you deploy it correct for what hsould be the setup

[19:29:42] <Joe_Developer> no wait it's taco tuesday
[19:29:42] <signalblue> any good DNS provider does that zetorian
[19:29:54] <signalblue> it's not compliant with the DNS standards but it works

[19:30:21] <signalblue> spam alert
[19:30:29] <signalblue> I HATE Microsoft
[19:30:33] <fritzwastaken> I mean, it could be worst
[19:30:36] <fritzwastaken> I could be a discord user
[19:30:39] <xe0n> signalblue: hate is a strong word
[19:30:41] <signalblue> my self-hosted email goes to spam
[19:30:46] <fritzwastaken> xe0n: bruuuuh
[19:30:48] <signalblue> on Microsoft's platform
[19:30:48] <fritzwastaken> go to sleep
[19:30:54] <xe0n> you better fix your email then..
[19:31:01] <signalblue> it's not an open-relay
[19:31:03] <xe0n> it aint microsoft's fault
[19:31:08] <signalblue> it's in my basement
[19:31:14] <xe0n> yep...and?
[19:31:25] <signalblue> DMARC, DKIM, and SPF are all enabled
[19:31:32] <signalblue> TLS is enabled as well
[19:31:37] <voice06[m]> Microsoft is pretty obnoxious with their requirements, my self-hosted is seen as good by all other providers
[19:31:46] <signalblue> I have a relay with a commercial IP
[19:31:47] <voice06[m]> MS still marks it unsafe
[19:31:51] <signalblue> still goes to spam
[19:31:53] <xe0n> you know they use a number of different lists, yeah?
[19:32:06] <signalblue> yeah and the IP is not on any of them
[19:32:18] *** Joins: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn)
[19:32:36] <voice06[m]> last I checked to get an exemption you have to be the owner of the IP block and contact them
[19:32:42] <signofzeta> yeah, I had that problems too.  I had to sign up for their SNDS (or whatever) service to get myself unblocked.
[19:32:55] <signalblue> that's BS
[19:33:04] <signalblue> Because I don't own my blocks
[19:33:09] <signalblue> that's too expensive
[19:33:15] <xe0n> do you own your own legos?
[19:33:16] <xe0n> :P
[19:33:33] <signofzeta> my mail server is in a public cloud.  They had to allow-list my IP's.  Maybe the last person to use those IP addresses *was* a spammer.  I dunno.  No problems since, though.
[19:33:36] <signalblue> yes because it's cheaper than tacos
[19:33:46] <voice06[m]> like I said, its good everywhere else so I just figure if you're using MS oh well
[19:33:46] <fritzwastaken> s/tacos/hookers
[19:33:47] <layer8> signalblue meant: "yes because it's cheaper than hookers"
[19:33:57] <voice06[m]> guess no email for you
[19:34:05] <signofzeta> Yahoo gave me the same problem, but it was easier to fix myself with them.
[19:34:05] <signalblue> signofzeta: which cloud?
[19:34:08] <signalblue> oracle?
[19:34:11] <signofzeta> signalblue: Amazon EC2
[19:34:20] <signalblue> my server works everywhere but with MS
[19:34:25] <signalblue> it goes to spam on MS
[19:34:30] <xe0n> then log a ticket with them and sort it out?
[19:34:40] <signalblue> again
[19:34:47] <signalblue> I don't own the block
[19:35:08] <xe0n> or if its your work email, add your address to safe senders list so it doesnt end up in junk
[19:35:22] <signalblue> not the point
[19:35:33] <signalblue> it's my personal email
[19:35:34] <xe0n> then refer back to suggestion 1 :P
[19:35:36] <signofzeta> I gave MS and Yahoo my IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  They removed them from whatever list they were on, and it's been smooth sailing ever since.  Obviously, SPF/DKIM/DMARC yourself first.
[19:35:52] <PublicWiFi> signalblue: you use nginx FOSS or nginx Plus?
[19:36:01] <signalblue> signofzeta: right but the issue I have is that's not a dedicated IP
[19:36:09] <signalblue> it's shared with other users
[19:36:19] <signalblue> because it's the free tier of an SMTP relay
[19:36:20] <signofzeta> signalblue: that's a problem, then.  Any way to get yourself a dedicated/static one?
[19:36:23] <xe0n> there ya go
[19:36:29] <signofzeta> signalblue: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.  that sucks.
[19:36:32] <signalblue> I could... I'd just need to get a VPS
[19:36:45] <xe0n> smh lol! funny
[19:36:47] <signalblue> but the IP I use right now has PTR records and all

[20:03:11] <csws> y'know
[20:03:13] <csws> worst comes to worst
[20:03:18] <csws> I guess you could add the fqdn to the hosts file
[20:03:26] <signalblue> ok so I need to add an A record for 192.168.1.10 that points to DC01 or something
[20:03:28] <csws> like if your domain is mega fucked

[20:03:49] <csws> uhh
[20:03:53] <signalblue> Can I map an IP to an IP?
[20:03:56] <csws> signalblue, can you add a conditional forwarder to forward requests to your DC?
[20:04:04] <signalblue> domain to IP = normal DNS
[20:04:12] <csws> or y'know.. change your primary DNS to point to the DC
[20:04:14] <signalblue> I need IP to IP
[20:04:15] <csws> or is the DC's DNS fried?
[20:04:19] <signalblue> yeah
[20:04:21] <xe0n> maybe fix your dns so you can join the machine in the supported....and normal way?
[20:04:37] <xe0n> inb4 primary dns is set to 8.8.8.8
[20:04:38] <signalblue> well no we just use 1.1.1.1 because I heard it was faster

[20:11:35] <csws> tbh I was an egotistical monster in SD
[20:11:37] <Cl0udNinja> of course he did, he even squeezed it tenderly
[20:11:41] <csws> but I don't think I was thaaat bad
[20:11:44] <sintax> didn't pay attention during training and couldn't figure out tickets and the system. 
[20:11:48] <sintax> i got him fired.

[20:13:58] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> they are...rough
[20:14:06] <signalblue> SD cards are awesome... I can eat them and no one will know the data is gone
[20:14:20] <sintax> Cl0udNinja: oh i ask questions like crazy for clarification. i've got a list for my IT Dir. today.
[20:14:20] <signalblue> microSD I mean
[20:14:31] <Cl0udNinja> until this job, I was basically 'the guy', if I didnt have the answer, I had to go find, or make an answer. now, I work on a team of people and questions are the only way for me to do shit without doubling work
[20:14:32] <sintax> signalblue: you can eat the bigger ones too without issue.
[20:14:36] <csws> at 10+ years in SD I'd start researching how to tie a noose
[20:14:37] <csws> seriously screw that
[20:14:58] <Cl0udNinja> did you know you have to pay a licensing fee to use SD cards in an electronic device?
[20:15:00] <Cl0udNinja> :|
[20:15:00] <sintax> Cl0udNinja: i feel ya. Now i get voluntold for stuff haha
[20:15:04] <sintax> but there's only 4 of us
[20:15:18] <sintax> and one of us only does the erp, crm stuff
[20:15:20] <csws> Cl0udNinja, yeah there's a royalty fee or something that the manufacturer pays?
[20:15:24] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[20:15:26] <csws> CD was the same
[20:15:29] <sintax> I get the help desk and up
[20:15:35] <signalblue> Cl0udNinja: I wish I could pay less and get more
[20:15:35] <sintax> then another sysadmin and then the director. 
[20:15:42] <Cl0udNinja> I was going to use an SD card in my project but I saw that and noped out
[20:15:49] <Cl0udNinja> its expensive af too, not just some small fee
[20:15:51] <csws> lol what
[20:15:56] <sintax> however they can get you
[20:15:57] <csws> were you making your own SD card from scratch?
[20:16:03] <signalblue> yeah probably
[20:16:14] <csws> OH
[20:16:22] <signalblue> just take some nand flash dies and plop it on a board
[20:16:25] <Cl0udNinja> csws, no, I was just going to use it for storage in place of the eeprom/nvram chips I was using for storage
[20:16:27] <csws> yeah I think I remember this now
[20:16:36] <csws> yeah and there's a cost to have that functionality right?
[20:16:39] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[20:16:44] <Cl0udNinja> beyond just parts
[20:16:48] <csws> brutal
[20:16:52] <signalblue> yeah
[20:16:56] <csws> tbh I'd just yolo it and shove it in there anyway
[20:17:00] <signalblue> what's the solution now ninja?
[20:17:00] <sintax> giggity
[20:17:07] <csws> USB? lol
[20:17:31] <Cl0udNinja> signalblue, I've got 2 eeproms/nand flash, totaling 132MBit
[20:17:59] <Cl0udNinja> whats really stupid about the SD thing is it uses common communications protocols, its nothing special
[20:18:17] <Cl0udNinja> but if you want an SD card you gotta pay the SD police
[20:18:20] <sintax> it's special because you have to pay to use it. 
[20:18:40] <csws> Well it is Secure
[20:18:44] <Cl0udNinja> I just meant  nothing special in terms of its communications
[20:18:50] <Cl0udNinja> ... not really.. lol
[20:18:57] <csws> But
[20:18:59] <csws> but....
[20:19:04] <csws> "Secure Digital"
[20:19:13] <Cl0udNinja> yeah idk what the fuck is so secure about it
[20:19:18] <Cl0udNinja> its definitely not ..
[20:19:27] <csws> technology connections did a thing on the etymology
[20:19:36] <Cl0udNinja> it uses a common communications protocol and the bytes are readable on the lines
[20:19:59] <Cl0udNinja> if theres any 'security' in it, its hidden away inside its voodoo plastic
[20:20:15] <csws> I think it was something where they were doing some weird optical format, made the SD logo etc. for it
[20:20:19] <Cl0udNinja> but as far as operations go, you send a command and you get a usable byte
[20:20:20] <csws> and then they threw that out and made SD as we know it today
[20:20:24] <csws> but never bothered to change the name or logo
[20:20:31] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[20:20:33] <csws> which is why the D has that reflection in it
[20:20:40] <csws> even though it's not a disc lol

[21:11:53] <Cl0udNinja> someone went and allowed specific ports, and then went and allowed all ports afterwards
[21:12:01] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[21:12:05] <PublicWiFi> whyyyy
[21:12:07] <Cl0udNinja> idk
[21:12:08] <PublicWiFi> they should be kneecapped
[21:12:10] <Cl0udNinja> right
[21:12:16] <teh_f4ll3n> allow any from any
[21:12:17] <Cl0udNinja> so I get to fix that this week
[21:12:29] <Cl0udNinja> teh_f4ll3n, default drop, allow any any
[21:12:34] <PublicWiFi> lmfao
[21:12:43] <gibby> -_-
[21:12:45] <gibby> pls no
[21:13:29] <teh_f4ll3n> don't forget about nat reflection settings with improper DNS
[21:14:27] <Cl0udNinja> a few weeks ago I had to do some nasty shit with docker so I could run a container on 80/443 next to our other shit
[21:14:51] <Cl0udNinja> basically, the container has its own actual network IP
[21:14:56] <Cl0udNinja> no nat...
[21:15:25] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, thats bad
[21:16:10] <Cl0udNinja> theres a reason I downed a whole bottle of rum in 3 days that week
[21:16:49] <estranger> YES. more kafka promotion please
[21:17:02] <estranger> makes everyones lives better
[21:17:36] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> The NAT is really just for exposing port 22 on a container that's doing data ingestion on a ETL thingy.
[21:17:52] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> The storage containers are all private endpoints cause **reasons**
[21:18:23] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> and the container has to be on the same private vnet as the storage containers
[21:19:08] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> hence inbound traffic to the firewall on port 22 is dnat to the container port 22
[21:19:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> That's secure, right?
[21:29:04] <PublicWiFi> they use public key auth right?
[21:29:10] <PublicWiFi> no password logins etc
[21:29:32] <PublicWiFi> and also i usually change my ssh port to like 10022 or something, it really cuts down on the probes
[21:31:14] <thegodsquirrel> If possible, you could allowlist the incoming IPs (if static) as well, not always possible
[21:32:28] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> yea no password auth and whitelisting will be added. That part is easy as the NAT rule includes a source address

[23:29:58] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> But it won't be
[23:30:22] <Cl0udNinja> right, but as it cools, the crust shifts (tectonic plates), more mountains and shit appear, and the earth shrinks
[23:30:56] <Activ8> when things work then it's great.  The test is when it comes to the support
[23:30:59] <Cl0udNinja> eventually it cools to martian levels, and tectonic motion stops, and the planet is no longer shrinking

[23:48:23] <sintax> modern problems require modern solutions
[23:48:38] <webby> Yeah, let me just start up hack.exe and hack the mainframe.
[23:48:46] <PattyCakes> ^
[23:48:55] <PattyCakes> That's what they pay you for right?
[23:50:30] <signofzeta> if you need admin rights, just install hack.exe as a Windows printer driver.
[23:52:15] <PublicWiFi> so I've got myself confused with this reverse proxy business lol
[23:53:11] <PublicWiFi> I have an exchange server w/ external SSL cert. I'm wanting to put this proxy in front of it. Do I give my proxy this SSL cert?
[23:53:31] <PublicWiFi> because it should be transparent right?
[23:53:35] <PattyCakes> I am an LTT simp - https://put.gd/1630437792/2021-08-30-12.25.11.jpg
[23:53:56] <signofzeta> Yes, PublicWiFi.  Your SSL terminator/proxy should have a cert (or certs) for all the names.
[23:54:06] <signofzeta> There's no harm in keeping it on your Exchange box, though.
[23:54:16] <PublicWiFi> okay making sure
[23:54:27] <webby> So glad for msys2 and cygwin. I couldn't think of doing anything on windows without unix-like tools.
[23:54:28] <signofzeta> Come to think of it, it should need that cert, unless your proxy is also handling POP/IMAP/SMTP directly.
[23:54:37] <PublicWiFi> itll only be in front of the one exhcange box so I guess ill just give my proxy the same cert the exchange box has?
[23:54:41] <signofzeta> You'll also need it for Mutual TLS, if you've implemented that optional feature.
[23:54:54] <PublicWiFi> nah thisll only be for activesync, OWA, and autodiscover
[23:54:57] <PublicWiFi> so http/https only
[23:55:29] <signofzeta> If any Exchange services are public-facing, then it will still need its certificate.  Otherwise, go ahead and move it.
[23:55:53] <PublicWiFi> after this nothing will be directly external facing
[23:56:01] <signofzeta> As far as authenticating between your proxy and the real server, consult the proxy's documentation.  I've never implemented one in practice.  Being in the SMB scope, we just said "Exchange Online" and shut them down.
[23:56:02] <PublicWiFi> itll be through the proxy and/or the cisco EAS
[23:59:08] <signofzeta> OK, and you have something else handling SMTP in and out?
