[02:46:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Allegedly, AV1 is royalty free.
[02:47:07] <BaronVladimirHar> In reality, it's a patent trap and Sisvel claims they have almost 1,300 patents and you'll be sued if you implement it without paying them.
[02:47:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Sisvel is a European patent troll. In one case, just one patent they claimed on MP3 got the German government to seize a shipment of MP3 players and destroy them all.
[02:48:27] <BaronVladimirHar> The only codecs we can be sure are safe to use, in reality, are Ogg Vorbis, and Ogg Theora.
[02:48:48] <BaronVladimirHar> The algorithms are very old and Xiph.org released them into the public domain at that point in time.
[02:49:48] <BaronVladimirHar> So it wouldn't be plausible for any patents to still apply to them.
[02:50:08] <BaronVladimirHar> VP3's bitstream format and specification was the core of Theora, and dates back to 2003.
[02:50:29] <BaronVladimirHar> So essentially, it's an 18 year old codec. Almost 19, at the core.
[02:50:44] <BaronVladimirHar> Theora made some improvements, but still....
[02:51:09] <BaronVladimirHar> Apple threatened "thermonuclear warfare" in court over Theora and said it was "impossible" to implement a Free video codec.
[02:51:41] <BaronVladimirHar> But that was in 2009, when they were lobbying, successfully, to keep Free codecs out of the HTML 5 specification so they could shove patented stuff in it.
[02:52:07] <BaronVladimirHar> The W3C very nearly standardized HTML 5 video with Theora and Vorbis as the mandatory codecs.
[02:52:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Apple is part of the MPEG-LA patent troll that stands to benefit from these shakedown operations against web browser companies and people who use those codecs for streaming.
[02:53:37] <BaronVladimirHar> Eventually, h.264's patents will expire. Nobody uses h.265, broadly, because no browser other than Safari, supports it.
[02:54:20] <BaronVladimirHar> The goal is to basically support h.264 in a deprecated fashion and continue supporting it after the patents expire, for Google.
[02:54:30] <BaronVladimirHar> Then the next generation stuff is WebM.
[02:55:38] <BaronVladimirHar> <ede> "all these *different* naming..." <- AVC and h.264 are the same thing.
[02:55:45] <BaronVladimirHar> HEVC is h.265
[02:55:55] <Timvde> I wonder if Daala is still going somewhere
[02:56:00] <BaronVladimirHar> They claim they're working on a Versatile Video Coding format called h.266, but I think nobody is going to be interested by then.

[02:56:18] <BaronVladimirHar> h.265 is a disaster on multiple fronts.
[02:56:20] <Timvde> Last commit one year ago on https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/daala :(
[02:56:47] <BaronVladimirHar> It basically is a patent treadmill, it's dead slow on encoding and playback, and you have to go to several different patent pools and pay all of them for licenses.
[02:57:09] <BaronVladimirHar> So it's very expensive.
[02:57:28] <BaronVladimirHar> Then on top of that, most of the h.265 patents are actually h.264 patents that apply to both formats.
[02:57:44] <BaronVladimirHar> But you have to pay to license them AGAIN even if you already have an h.264 license.

[02:58:22] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: daala got rolled into AV1.
[02:58:32] <Timvde> Only small parts
[02:58:36] <ede> BaronVladimirHar: like with batteries... there's AA and AAA (and some more), there's monocells and babycells (and block, but that one's clear), there's LR6. at least 3 systems.
[02:58:37] <Timvde> A lot of AV1 is actually VP10
[02:58:45] <Timvde> (iiuc)
[02:59:11] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, AV1 is not unique in having patent trolls claiming you need to buy a license.
[02:59:15] <BaronVladimirHar> Same situation with VP8 and VP9.
[02:59:20] <ede> what i memorized on youtube is that there's 1 webm and 2 mp4, of which one is the new one.
[02:59:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Google can afford to essentially break the rules and dare people to sue.
[02:59:48] <ede> i even tried to get an overview on that whole MPEG universe, but... no.
[02:59:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Others might not be able to.
[03:00:25] <BaronVladimirHar> Their sickening behavior with the Harmony Java stuff could ruin computer software as we know it.
[03:00:43] <BaronVladimirHar> If "SCO"racle wins in court, ultimately, Wine is certainly illegal at this point.
[03:02:01] <BaronVladimirHar> The whole reason Google went down the path of Apache Harmony even though it was slow, buggy, and not compatible with JAVA, was because they wanted to avoid the GPL.
[03:02:28] <BaronVladimirHar> And now on top of being sued, they have a GPL'd JAVA anyway!
[03:03:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Apache is pretty much where open source software projects go to crash on the rocks and die.
[03:03:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Maybe when Firefox has close to zero users left (they lost 40 million in the past year), there will be an Apache Firefox that pretends to have a release every several years.
[03:04:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Like what happened with OpenOffice.
[03:06:11] <BaronVladimirHar> <ede> "i even tried to get an overview..." <- A lot of what they do is just to get patents.
[03:06:33] <BaronVladimirHar> They even put broken, stupid, and counterproductive "features" into their codecs just to get patents.
[03:08:01] <BaronVladimirHar> MP3 was very inefficient and a lot of that was it was overdesigned to stuff it full of patents.
[03:08:15] <BaronVladimirHar> They patented things that made MP3s sound worse.
[03:09:30] <BaronVladimirHar> Musepack was not a transform codec, and managed to be at least as efficient as MP3 anyway. Even though it was Layer 2 at the center of it all.
[03:09:45] <BaronVladimirHar> No MDCT usage, just 32 subbands.
[03:10:28] <BaronVladimirHar> MP3 is downright crazy if you're looking at it and have no idea about the patent situation they were going for.
[03:11:42] <ede> not only codecs, which one was it, MP-21? the one which is more a framework waiting to be filled than anything else
[03:11:59] <BaronVladimirHar> The PQMF filterbank and the MDCT don't align well.
[03:12:12] <BaronVladimirHar> So there's a quantization noise filter step which isn't lossless either.
[03:12:34] <ede> MP3 is old. really old.
[03:12:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Ogg Vorbis and Low Complexity AAC actually do LESS.
[03:12:57] <BaronVladimirHar> They operate exclusively in the frequency, not the time, domain
[03:13:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, a lot of people using Bluetooth and complaining about the sound quality of the simple subband codec, are really complaining that they are feeding MP3 files into it as input.

[13:52:59] <fscklife> Someone says AdBlock/NoScript reduce security because they increase attack surface and I respond that add-ons are run sandboxed and the evil JS is a much larger attack surface
