[00:46:10] <matsaman> the web server admins

[00:47:42] <dan01> does CORS depend on the response header of weather.com?

[00:47:50] <matsaman> that's my understanding, though I've not dealt with it much

[01:42:29] <dan01> I'm now looking into parsing XML
[01:42:32] <dan01> oh God...
[01:42:36] <wroathe> Slade: They're different kinds of tools with different kinds of goals. Jenkins is a CI/CD server, and it's typically used to manage building, testing, packaging, and publishing build artifacts. Ansible, on the other hand, is a configuration management tool that you use to manage infrastructure and deployments
[01:42:52] <wroathe> Slade: There's a very slight bit of overlap, but Jenkins would be a poor replacement for Ansible
[01:44:09] <GreenJello> it would even be reasonable to run ansible from a jenkins job, in some cases
[01:44:21] <wroathe> Indeed
[01:44:32] <Slade> have jenkins, finding it clumsy, just wanting to peek at alternatives
[01:44:51] <wroathe> Slade: Teamcity, Gitlab CI, Circle CI
[01:45:37] <GreenJello> there isn't much for "jenkins but better" that I've come across
[01:45:51] <wroathe> Yeah, those are just alternatives, but Jenkins is old trusty
[01:45:52] <GreenJello> most of the alternatives are services
[01:45:58] *** Joins: Guest9364 (~Test@ool-2f105398.dyn.optonline.net)
[01:46:22] <GreenJello> where you get a fresh VM or docker container in someone else's cloud that runs your job, and disappears when it finishes
[01:46:25] <wroathe> Although if I was setting up a pipeline for a smaller team, I'd probably just reach for Gitlab and use the built in CI server
[01:47:49] *** Joins: sillyslux__ (~silly@user/silly)
[01:47:55] <Slade> interesting, teamcity onprem is free until you have more than 3 agents
[01:48:10] <wroathe> That's a good option too
[01:48:17] <Slade> Jenkins just seems to require a lot of boilerplate per job, and 99% of my jobs are redundant
[01:48:19] <GreenJello> I switched from jenkins to github actions at work, and it's certainly more cost effective and harder to break, but really difficult to work with
[01:48:26] <wroathe> I've used Teamcity a few times in the past (and even managed it once), and found it to be pretty OK

You'd have Kubernetes for managing environments, configuration, and deployments, and perhaps something like Artifactory for storing build artifacts, and then something like Jenkins to manage builds and driving test runs.

[04:48:28] <Donitz> oh no
[04:48:35] <Donitz> did youtube just break the back button
[04:48:57] <Donitz> yepp
[04:48:59] <Donitz> idiots
[04:49:33] <Donitz> why the f do websites keep trying (and failing) to replace browser functionality for no god damn reason at all
[04:53:26] <GreenJello> why do people assume decisions are made for no reason?
[04:56:04] <Donitz> Okay, let me clarify
[04:56:06] <Donitz> for STUPID reasons
[04:56:22] <Donitz> like you want a fancy ugly looking search function
[04:56:54] <Donitz> or you think normal links are too boring
[04:57:50] <wroathe> Damn. I was going to complain about something too, but it looks like Donitz is sucking the air out of the room already
[04:58:32] <jaawerth> google does love ruining their own stuff, that's for sure
[04:59:26] <Donitz> I'm still amazed that they kept the context sensitive tab-button shuffle for google search
[04:59:34] <Donitz> who even asked for it?
[05:00:26] <wroathe> These test runners, like Jest, and Playwright/test, keep doing this really strange an opaque thing where they seemingly parse the javascript files and extract the specs from them, instead of just running as-is.
[05:00:57] <wroathe> I'm trying to define this higher order function to wrap my specs and start collecting coverage and then merging it in to my coverage map
[05:01:00] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/JustinChristensen/a69e3db7fcf9a46d3bfd5245eb8b62a1
[05:01:55] <wroathe> Funny enough, I was also trying to get describe/beforeEach/afterEach/etc set on globalThis in the global setup file, but playwright uses child processes

[05:02:25] <jaawerth> usually the child processes are for running test suites in parallel
[05:02:27] <wroathe> And before I added the require on line 5 of that first file it was just silently failing to execute beforeEach and afterEach
[05:02:29] <jaawerth> though I've never used playright
[05:02:35] <jaawerth> but stuff like that is one of the reasons I like tape so much
[05:02:39] <wroathe> jaawerth: Indeed. That's a side issue anyway.
[05:02:52] <wroathe> jaawerth: The main issue is that this withCoverage helper isn't working, and it should be
[05:04:09] <jaawerth> tape is super minimal, just lets you define and run your tests using functions, so you can do as much higher-order stuff as you want. in exchange, you don't get anything like beforeEach out of the box, but meh
[05:05:37] <wroathe> I'm thinking about making a new test runner for playwright anyway. I had this idea a long time ago about modeling the test runner as a state machine, instead of doing this beforeEach/test/afterEach thing
[05:05:47] <wroathe> (for end-to-end UI tests)
[05:06:20] <wroathe> Where transitions do things like click buttons, submit forms, or navigate, and states determine that they're in that state through expectations
[05:06:26] <wroathe> And you specify a test run as a list of transitions
[05:07:30] <wroathe> await run([navigateHome, fillFirstNameField, ..., submitForm]);

[05:38:29] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Eh, the coverage thing is a bit more involved than just being a bug. The playwright API supports collecting coverage, but the test runner doesn't add anything to that to make it easier to do across multiple worker processes.
[05:38:43] <wroathe> theskillwithin: My guess would be that making the test runner collect coverage is on their todo list

[09:01:52] <onosendi> Is one preferred over the other, or does it just depend if I need it to re-render or not? https://dpaste.org/zv7N
[09:02:44] <GreenJello> onosendi, the second one will never remove the class, so it's probably wrong
[09:03:19] <GreenJello> and you should only do manual dom manipulation when the declarative approach isn't viable
[09:04:00] <GreenJello> also it's weird to have a list of classes in state
[09:04:03] <theskillwithin> aka there is no reason to use a ref here because you can use className
[09:04:32] <theskillwithin> ya thats wierd as well, if you want conditional classes, do that inline in a condition probablyu
[09:04:34] <theskillwithin> probably
[09:05:06] <onosendi> GreenJello: Here is a full example, the ref usage is the ones that are commented out: https://dpaste.org/ccfi
[09:05:36] <onosendi> Animating stuff in `createPortal` is a pain in the ass.
[09:05:45] <theskillwithin> ie  className={cx(styles.foo, hidden && styles.hidden)}
[09:06:58] <GreenJello> onosendi, is the CSS animation or transition?
[09:07:05] <onosendi> GreenJello: animation
[09:07:59] <GreenJello> and why can't you just have a boolean state for if it's open or not?
[09:08:19] <GreenJello> and then pick the relevant class on line 58
[09:08:27] <onosendi> GreenJello: I was thinking of puting classes in state, because I need to `getBoundingRectClient` of the created portal.

[09:15:32] <theskillwithin> <Portal><div style={style}> </div></Portal>
[09:16:00] <GreenJello> onosendi, yeah, you've already returned from the component before a useEffect runs
[09:16:19] <onosendi> theskillwithin: style works in the portal, I just need a re-render, that's what I was opting for state to hold classes, so I get the re-render.
[09:16:27] <theskillwithin> ah
[09:16:34] <GreenJello> but the style thing isn't in your real example, so can't really consider it until you add it there

[20:39:12] <paule32> thx for the infos

[20:40:50] <paule32> to not coming in the conflict with other packages, or frameworks ...
[20:41:46] <paule32> so, i can not .bind event functions with array of objects ?
[20:42:05] <wroathe> paule32: There are a few ways to approach that, but my favorite is wrapping the callback
[20:42:45] <paule32> can you point me such approches ?

[20:45:37] <paule32> ok, thx
[20:46:00] <wroathe> paule32: Or in simple cases you can just surround all of your event listeners in a closure and use state from the outer scope

[22:27:39] <celphi> did you try removing that one file
[22:27:44] <Rockwood> everything is coded fine at my end
[22:28:13] <Rockwood> i downloaded new react folder and tried but same error
[22:28:16] <celphi> `return radioChild.props.disabled ? /*#__PURE__*/React.cloneElement(radioChild, props) : /*#__PURE__*/React.cloneElement(ra` makes no sense to me
[22:28:23] <celphi> but i dont know react
[22:28:34] <Rockwood> ok
[22:28:40] <celphi> `/*...` means a comment to me
[22:29:01] <Rockwood> ok
[22:29:06] <celphi> but there's probably some sort of str replace before it's interepted

[23:30:26] <debron> hi there. About JWT authentication between symfony and a REACT application... could i make few questions ?
[23:31:04] <debron> im thinking on setting the token in a Cookie in the client browser. Problem i see with this i will not be able to access the token from the js application, but i dont think i need it
[23:31:13] <debron> is there a better way of doing this?

[23:33:26] <GreenJello> aside from the general issues with JWT, there's nothing specifically wrong with storing it in a cookie
[23:33:38] <GreenJello> usually the client being unable to access it is a good thing
[23:33:59] <debron> thanks
[23:34:27] <debron> Ive been reading about there is a way to double-ensure the application by setting a second cookie, but i still dont understand it much
[23:34:42] <debron> and im afraid that method would turn my API not REST anymore
[23:34:50] <debron> am I wrong? does it worth?
[23:35:10] <onosendi> GreenJello: I ended up not having to re-render, I just set the style directly in useEffect: `useEffect(() => { ref.current.style ... })`.
