[03:12:31] <dale> davidfetter: Are you on Linux?  If so, and if your hardware will permit it, and if your distro is so configured, I bet switching to another virtual TTY and logging in will show that LESSCLOSE is not being set there.

[03:12:51] <dale> You can probably also track down whatever the parent process is of your new terminal and read its environment variables from /proc to see that LESSCLOSE is set there.
[03:12:56] <twkm> see ormaaj's suggestion, re changing what the terminal invokes.

[03:40:08] <twkm> there are ways.
[03:41:03] <twkm> e.g., if decision; then fancy >logfile 2>errlog; else fancy; fi
[03:41:27] <twkm> or, if decision; then exec >logfile 2>errlog; fi; fancy
[03:41:31] <twkm> or, ...
[03:42:24] <twkm> if you want fear aka syntax in variables then you want eval, which is a poor choice.
[03:44:19] <superboot> Ah, I see. Thanks. I forgot about exec.
[03:46:12] <ormaaj> what needs to be dynamic? You're allowed to use  >"$logfile"
[03:47:13] <superboot> ormaaj: Yes, this is the solution I went with.
[03:47:38] <ormaaj> dynamic fd is rather uncommon but there's `{var}>file` for that.
[03:48:35] <superboot> With var expanding to 1,2,3,etc?
[03:48:46] <ormaaj> you probably don't want that. it has some gotchas.

[13:44:45] <kasper81> hey guys, i learned that ls is bad choice in pipeline and we must consider alternatives. it is because ls doesn't properly quote the output.
[13:45:25] <kasper81> however, i was wondering, has there been any proposal to add something like `-q` switch to improve ls itself for future?

[16:03:54] <Xogium> cat did sound a lot better than using echo, but if there's a better way…
[16:04:06] <djph> "not bash" is probably the "better way".  
[16:04:31] <djph> I've used it before to do quick and dirty with printf ... but ... it makes hideous formatting

[16:13:02] <jetchisel> There are a lot of things that shellcheck will complain about, the important is its just a warning and not an error

[16:14:13] <Xogium> are they colored differently or something ? I'm blind, so yeah colors, hum

[19:45:11] <osse> maybe you want /bin/bash -c exit
[19:45:41] <PlayerOne> You mean like when you're launching a bash, it asks for commands like an interpreter, but before launching it assumes options and the first "plain" option is a script file?
[19:46:16] <twkm> subshells can suprise like that too.
[19:46:24] <PlayerOne> "plain" argument *
[19:46:28] <twkm> # echo foo | exit ; echo still here
[19:46:29] <shbot> twkm: still here
[19:47:08] <PlayerOne> twkm, so exit "ate" the stdout of first echo?

[19:50:32] <PlayerOne> What do you prefer for Bash?
[19:50:43] <twkm> bash or zsh (or i hear fish) are more friendly for interactive use.
[19:50:56] <PlayerOne> I see
[19:51:06] <PlayerOne> fish is considered exotic
[19:51:29] <PlayerOne> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)
[19:51:40] <PlayerOne> > Fish is considered an exotic shell since it does not rigorously adhere to POSIX shell standards
[19:52:01] <kurahaupo> For obscure interactive shells my preference is perl -d
[19:53:23] <kurahaupo> PlayerOne: Did you mean "what do I prefer for Bash?", or "what do I prefer Bash for?"?
[19:53:26] <twkm> fish being interactive friendly was the point in my mentioning it.  zsh isn't posix either unless you beat it with a stick.
[19:54:11] <PlayerOne> kurahaupo, perhaps language barrier. What's the difference, sorry?

[19:56:24] <PlayerOne> twkm, such behavior like non-quoted variables being processed like quoted is very odd
[19:56:52] <twkm> zsh people believe it makes more sense, but you can make zsh do it the posix way too.
[19:58:02] <PlayerOne> kurahaupo, I reread the a() 6 times, and didn't get it haha
[19:58:14] <PlayerOne> sorry
[19:58:30] <kurahaupo> PlayerOne: to answer both questions: (b) I use Bash for my main interactive shell, and for writing scripts to to 500 lines. (a) I have a build farm with 80 versions of Bash
[19:58:44] <twkm> zsh (and i believe fish) both have nice(r) programmable completion (than bash), and prompt handling, and ... all things that are important (to some) for interactive use.  ksh does not.
[19:58:54] <PlayerOne> a farm!?
[20:00:00] <kurahaupo> a "build farm" is a collection of build servers which you can farm with out to
[20:00:09] <kurahaupo> a "build farm" is a collection of build servers which you can farm WORK out to
[20:00:16] <PlayerOne> farm what?
[20:00:52] <PlayerOne> twkm, I see. So zsh or bash are good choices.
[20:01:04] <kurahaupo> "farm out" means "didtribute, especially workload", dating from well before computers were common
[20:01:45] <PlayerOne> I see. So these are software build machines for various languages?
[20:01:53] <PlayerOne> building*
[20:02:19] <kurahaupo> Mostly compiling C (which Bash is written in)
[20:02:32] <PlayerOne> Which automatically redistribute their tasks in order to have more utilized and optimized performance, right?
[20:02:54] <kurahaupo> That's the idea,
[20:03:15] <PlayerOne> I see. So you're bullding Bash executables? Like Bash -v 1, Bash -v 2?
[20:03:20] <kurahaupo> but "optimized" generally means "get the build finished sooner"

[20:04:35] <PlayerOne> Perhaps, depends on the definition of `optimized` in that context. Some might include power resource amount like lectricity or heat level etc. where optimized would mean a comfort and relatively fast result.
[20:04:36] <twkm> bash is a good choice.  it is perhaps the best, though many do not agree.  but for a datapoint, i don't use tend to it for scripting even though i could.

[20:09:21] <twkm> i don't have per configure option either, though that can be useful for testing what others might have done.  i've since given up doing those sorts of things.
[20:09:25] <PlayerOne> I see. I really like the Bash. But the main issue I had is to transfer array results from function. So, I had two ideas. 1 is to transfer a name of a variable which would a function use to write a result to. Like `declare -n resultReference="$referenceName"`, but this resulted in some weird things if a caller and function had (even) local variables called the same. The result was empty. The second
[20:09:27] <PlayerOne> idea I had is to create an assosciative array BEFORE calling a funtion and transfer a function the arrays name. Then in the function check if such associative array exists like ("$(declare -p FOO 2>/dev/null)" == "declare -A"* ]]) and if it doesn't throw an error, if exists - continue, but I'm not really sure if that won't interefere somehow like in the first idea.
[20:10:05] *** Quits: apos (~apos@gateway/tor-sasl/apos) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:10:15] <PlayerOne> Like, the first issue is `declare -n reference=reference`
[20:11:08] <PlayerOne> I have created checks in the start of functions like `if [ "$referenceName" = "referenceNameTemp" ]`, then throw an error.
[20:12:01] <twkm> agreed upon globals can be annoying to those that want bash to be more otherlanguage-like, but indeed is a quite common technique for shell scripts.
[20:12:16] <PlayerOne> The main point is to save a result into a variable after calling a function. Preferably, to an assoc array.

[20:15:28] <osse> another apporach i've seen is to use reply or REPLY to write the "return value" to. 
[20:15:31] <twkm> indirection avoids that, but is clumsier.
[20:17:37] <PlayerOne> osse, is the REPLY a global var?
[20:17:51] <twkm> yes, global, indirection or a nameref.
[20:18:17] <osse> as far as the function that sets it, yes. I guess it can be made local in the calling scope
[20:18:19] <twkm> REPLY is a global.  it is expected in some contexts.

[20:22:06] <PlayerOne> Haha. Call a function to generate a random return variable name (check if exists in already used and actual, else regenerate). Save that name. Call a function, passing that name. A function returns using that name. Read the value from the caller and unset that variable.
[20:22:40] <osse> if you use the REPLY technique the most reasonable approach would be to consider it transient and assign it to a meaningful name immediately after calling a function

[20:52:07] <pj> okay, then I must be thinking of something else.  I was thinking of how you have to eval the output of declare to read it back in, but that must be for a different reason.

[20:57:20] <PlayerOne> osse, I just... can't really go with default Bash naming which looks like Python's PEP8. I just... can't.. while knowing these are standard convensions which is "better" to fit, but... I use C# naming convention (mostly PascalCase or camelCase) like all public variables, constants or properties start with a uppercase, everything private like variables or fields start with a lower. Related:
[20:57:22] <PlayerOne> https://github.com/ktaranov/naming-convention/blob/master/C%23%20Coding%20Standards%20and%20Naming%20Conventions.md
[20:58:26] <pj> I don't think there's anything overly wrong with PascalCase or camelCase in that it shouldn't clash with anything, it just rubs a lot of people the wrong way.
[20:58:34] <twkm> more i wish bash were some other language.  still, bash doesn't care.
[20:58:46] <pj> the main thing to avoid is CAPS

[20:59:05] <PlayerOne> So, like Bash library with its "public" methods has these upper cased and everything it needs ineternally is lowercase. Like LibraryName_privateFunc(Var/Const) or LibraryName_PublicFunc(Var/Const) or LibraryName::privateFunc etc.
[20:59:06] <twkm> you'd be wise to avoid all upper-case for other than environment variables, but only all upper-case for those.
[20:59:12] <PlayerOne> Although, I didn't really use of :: thing
[20:59:34] <PlayerOne> twkm, not all uppercase, but PascalCase
[20:59:57] <PlayerOne> With big scripts these may really help oh dear.
[21:00:06] <twkm> i certainly don't care, and neither does bash.

[21:01:35] <pj> I have written some pretty big bash scripts, if they're heavy on calls to other programs then I tend to think bash is important and I'd rather use bash than 100+ system() calls in another language.
