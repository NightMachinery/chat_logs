[02:05:43] <krytarik> Well, regardless of before or after the move, whether you get "invite-only" or are forwarded to some other channel depends on 1.) if there is a forward channel set and 2.) if you got +Q set on your user.
[02:09:21] <sney> so, regardless of client behavior or user modes, you can't join #debian-next on libera, so:
[02:09:28] <sney> dpkg: #debian-next
[02:09:28] <dpkg> #debian-next is the channel for testing/unstable support on the OFTC network (irc.oftc.net), *not* on libera.chat.  If you are unable to join #debian-next, it means you did not read it's on irc.oftc.net. See also https://wiki.debian.org/IRC and https://wiki.debian.org/GettingHelpOnIrc

[03:05:22] <Khepra> so why did you lie this was debian squeeze, and why are you seeking support for RHEL in #debian.   _obviously_  the systems are very different.
[03:06:18] <aog> I didn't lie, I'm a debian user, the network is big -- there's debian, rh, centos, suse, all flavors depending on the admins that came through this company
[03:06:51] <aog> does it really matter? the sysv script has to work on them all regardless of OS flavor
[03:07:02] <Khepra> obviously it matters a lot
[03:07:19] <amacater_> aog: You have RHEL 6.* - unsupported, even by RHEL, sadly, unless you pay $$$ for Extended User Support :(
[03:07:30] <Khepra> like, one of few reasons systemd exists. before it, the differences in init scripting environments were humongous
[03:08:24] <Khepra> like, someone sees that /bin/bash and goes trigger happy on bashims. then that flops like a madlad under /bin/sh
[03:08:31] <aog> amacater_ not my problem, I just write the app and the installer -- how they run their servers I cannot interfere
[03:09:27] <aog> Khepra from this experience w/ sysv and reading about it today, seems they put scripting conventions in place
[03:09:42] <aog> that's why I had to import: . /etc/init.d/functions
[03:09:58] <aog> they should have put a convention on using only SH as well and avoid the mess
[03:10:23] <aog> as you can see even packages like openssh had their sysv script in bash
[03:10:28] <Khepra> another question is, what kind of "compatibility" you're after. everyone's on systemd except a few hobbysts systems run by a few LUGs
[03:10:41] <amacater_> aog: Just say no to anything two years + out of support
[03:11:17] <aog> I wrote an app, has to run on this client's network, my app installs only on systemd, so today I'm adding support for sysv install for this client

[03:14:06] <Khepra> you know how I test our in-house apps? yeah we have some unit tests, but those are a meh. we simply put to production for a subset of users :) they fall out, we see error report logs (automated, no human reports errors, pffft), and we fix it :)
[03:14:21] <amacater_> You _might_ find more information in Arch / Devuan but, essentially, sysvinit disappeared largely about three years ago. There will be lots of info on line but it's probably not a good idea to code for it - your RHEL 6 shoudl be 6.10 anyway
[03:14:36] <Khepra> arch? arch is hard-core bastion of systemd
[03:14:42] <aog> what I understood is that sysv has this `daemon` function to start the program, I used it but the program doesn't start as a daemon when I do service app start
[03:14:57] <Khepra> you can't run sysv on it even if you wanted, unlike say debian where sysv is a few apt installs away.
[03:14:58] <aog> it actually starts spitting output in stdout
[03:15:34] <amacater_> aog: You're not looking at pure sysvinit there - I've a feeling that RHEL 6 switched to upstart briefly - it's too long ago to think about it ...

[03:16:26] <aog> so if I was using a pure sysv, this way of starting the daemon would just work
[03:16:35] <Khepra> no. your app can pull in something like daemontolls or supervisord, and enjoy at least some process management sanity under sysv
[03:16:47] <Khepra> daemontools*
[03:17:13] <aog> I'll ask them if I'm allowed to install supervisord
[03:17:16] <Khepra> I used to work with supervisord before systemd. converted ALL the freebsd rc scripts to supervisord units. and just had that one, supervisord, run as a rc service
[03:17:16] <amacater_> Strictly, this is well off topic here - I'd suggest you take it to #centos / #rhel on Libera

[03:25:12] <Khepra> or... runit? maybe that too.  gitlab omnibus edition, for example, on debian, installs runit as a systemd service, and then the entire ecosystem is managed under runit

[03:28:39] <Khepra> we dropped gitlab after users started complaining about radical UI and functionality changes almost every week
[03:28:40] <amacater_> aog: It's also worthwhile pointing out to your client that they are running old software with NO support whatever and that it is in their interest to keep patched and up to date as far as possible.
[03:29:02] <aog> so they just write runit files and can then have a supervisor anywhere that hooks into systemd, sysv, upstart, etc.
[03:29:12] <Khepra> oh yeah, rhel6 is dead now right

[03:31:43] <duuude> Khepra: does debian check its packages in that way?
[03:31:44] <amacater_> Write it down and get sign off that you have made the situation clear: if a system that is obsolete breaks, it's not your problem and you can offer no guarantee for your software on such systems. Such support is best endeavours at most.
[03:32:16] <Khepra> duuude: no. what you need is selinux in strict mode with no unconfined_t, and then write all the policies not available under standard reference policy, which is rather limited because the ecosystem is huge

[03:36:18] <Khepra> that couldn't happen under a selinux policy
[03:36:42] <Khepra> you could redefine sudo, but your user's context would not have permission to execute your trojane'd code
[03:37:22] <duuude> I know you could restrict stuff in linux

[03:38:00] <duuude> does debian watch its packages for not having trojans etc

[03:38:45] <duuude> Khepra: I could redefine PATH
[03:38:53] <aog> hmm
[03:38:56] <Khepra> and to put the proper label you need to be properly authenticated to selinux. not even root can do that, without authentication

[04:08:33] <aog> against online signatures
[04:08:44] <Khepra> like, clamav? :)
[04:08:56] <Khepra> problem is, online signatures are far from useful
[04:09:01] <aog> hence one can always check their system to see if somehow any of the binaries has been replaced
[04:09:24] <aog> e.g. if someone swaps your sshd binary and puts one in w/ precompiled private key
[04:09:51] <aog> the hashed signature won't be the same as the one you installed
[04:09:52] <Khepra> there is, in theory, a possibility to verify signature chain from the developer down to the user of precompiled reproducible-built binary package
[04:09:59] <aog> and it'll spot it immediately
[04:10:09] <Khepra> but that's just a wet dream. there's no infra, no central databases, no tooling...
[04:10:16] <aog> Khepra yes but automatically not manually
[04:10:26] <Khepra> yes automatically, by, say, a future apt module
[04:10:42] <aog> apt-check --all
[04:11:23] <aog> [FOUND] compromised binary in /bin/ls remote signature .... | local sign ....
[04:11:31] *** Quits: hub (~hub@user/hub) (Quit: -)
[04:11:44] <Khepra> one reason where I prefer something like gentoo is that portage is basically a signed repository of recipes. the maintainer checks the upstream code and signs it, and you're guaranteed that (short of exploits in portage itself) you're running the code as-is at the moment of signing.
[04:12:04] *** Joins: hub (~hub@user/hub)
[04:12:07] <Khepra> but technically with gentoo-prefix project, one could run portage on any distro... I think
[04:12:36] <aog> guix takes it a step further and compiles everything on install :D
[04:12:46] <Khepra> yeah that's what gentoo does
[04:13:05] <Khepra> that's why portage are recipes: recipes where to download, verify hashes, build and install locally
[04:13:43] <aog> still, let's say you've already been breached -- you're forced to reinstall
[04:13:50] <Khepra> that's as direct as possible, verified, from developer's upstream repository straight to your computer
[04:14:02] <aog> you'll probably never find which parts of the system got compromised easily
[04:14:14] <Khepra> if you're breached, the only fix is nuke and pave
[04:14:32] <aog> such a tool would allow to recover the system
[04:14:34] <Khepra> you can't trust ANY tool. you can't even trust offlining the system and doing a check of drives, with no programs running on it
[04:15:07] <Khepra> too much effort for something that can easily be reinstalled and data pulled in from last known good backups
[04:15:41] <aog> wonder if it's possible to disable ldpreload and insmod at kernel level that not even root can do that anymore
[04:15:53] <aog> if they cannot preload nor insmod, how do they hide?
[04:15:58] <Khepra> yes, selinux.
[04:16:01] <aog> only by replacing the binaries
[04:16:10] <Khepra> selinux renders root just a nobody little unprivileged user.
[04:16:23] <aog> and that you can catch easily w/ a hash signature check tool
[04:16:27] <aog> if it existed :)
[04:16:52] <aog> a tool that makes sure that your installed binaries match the same hash of the remote repo
[04:17:12] <aog> Khepra how do you control selinux then?
[04:17:26] <Khepra> you authenticate against it and elevate privilege
[04:17:42] <Khepra> any user can do that, if th epolicy permit. selinux users are not system users
[04:17:43] <aog> just an extra password one can sniff
[04:18:10] <Khepra> but back to debian topic..... debian already signes and verfies packages comint out of its repos
[04:18:32] <aog> ok, and that's very nice for installing clean binaries
[04:18:39] <Khepra> it would be impossible to verify debian packages against upstream's repo, without the blockchain of all the changes from source to your machine+
[04:18:52] <aog> but there's no way to auto check the signature of those binaries once they are installed, in case you suspect a breach
[04:19:11] <Khepra> well, debsums, but you'd need to trust debsums
[04:19:14] <Khepra> ,i debsums
[04:19:16] <judd> Package debsums (admin, optional) in bullseye/amd64: tool for verification of installed package files against MD5 checksums. Version: 3.0.2; Size: 44.3k; Installed: 108k; Screenshot: https://screenshots.debian.net/package/debsums
[04:19:38] <Khepra> you could do it offline tho, so you don't run potentially trojane'd code
[04:19:46] <aog> why so hard? we just maintain a list of hashes
[04:19:52] <aog> then for every binary do: sha256sum `which sshd`
[04:19:58] <aog> and compare
[04:20:16] <Khepra> you'd need to trust sha256sum for that. just like you'd need to trust debsums
[04:20:35] <aog> you sha256 every executable in PATH and compare it
[04:20:42] <aog> you download sha256sum on the spot
[04:20:55] <Khepra> you can't trust that on infected machine

[04:21:18] <Khepra> if a machine is infected NO CODE running on it can be trusted, at all.

[04:22:10] <aog> you're going too deep w/ the breach, not all breaches are that complicated
[04:22:25] <Khepra> problem with the breaches is that you don't know how deep they are
[04:22:51] <aog> most attacks are script kiddies installing a miner that barely know what they're doing, using some automated tool coded by a lead hacker

[04:23:30] <Khepra> for example, I've dealt a lot with wordpress breaches. typically, an exploit allows the threat actor to download and execute code, which is second stage exploit (first was WP itself), and those typically attack the kernel direclty, or indirectly through attempted privilege elevation
[04:23:31] <somiaj> or some coworker disabling something because they want to get some fancy tool to work over api....
[04:24:08] <aog> ok so they breach wordpress and get a reverse shell w/ www-data privileges
[04:24:11] <Khepra> but once that second stage code is executed.... and just that, executed,  you can no longer trust that system. you have zero clue if it worked or not, and what shit it installed in the depths beyond userland's reach
[04:24:21] <aog> now they need to download some elevation exploit
[04:24:24] <aog> to get uid0
[04:24:30] <Khepra> yes that's what I just said
[04:24:58] <aog> ok so they run 10 exploits until they find one that works
[04:25:05] <aog> now they're root, and what they do?
[04:25:15] <Khepra> they attack the kernel typically
[04:25:34] <aog> install a miner, name it bash, install a botnet script or whatever and leave
[04:25:58] <aog> you spot the miner whatever name they gave it, as it's frying your cpu, easy to spot
[04:26:03] <Khepra> all kinds of things. but miners don't need root
[04:26:19] *** Joins: cheche (~cheche@8.red-81-41-130.staticip.rima-tde.net)
[04:26:26] <Khepra> there's two kinds of attacks. one that don't need root and can run as unprivileged www-data
[04:26:28] <aog> they're fancy? ok, hook up an ldpreload script to hide the process
[04:26:38] <aog> you still spot it immediately using unhide
[04:26:47] <Khepra> the other attack the kernel and then persist itself with very low level backdoors
[04:27:12] <aog> even more fancy? insmod a kernel rootkit -- now good luck finding that one as it's totally invisible
[04:27:35] <Khepra> so first step in avoiding a trap, is knowing of its existence -- tufir hawat :)   so we put selinux and apparmor policies and php-fpm can never execute code that's not labelled, and all those WP attacks fail
[04:27:56] *** Quits: KindOne (kindone@idlerpg/player/kindone) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[04:28:08] <Khepra> however, there's kind of WP attacks that go after the db itself and content and this is where selinux and apparmor fail
[04:28:11] <aog> you mean they'll never be able to execute the reverse shell
[04:28:15] <Khepra> right
[04:28:18] <aog> even if they breach wordpress
[04:28:25] <Khepra> right
[04:28:29] <aog> problem solved
[04:28:47] <aog> now, what's the % of selinux installed alongside wordpress servers? :D
[04:28:47] <Khepra> well yes, except those attacks that install javascripts into pages for the purpose of spreading malware
[04:28:58] <Khepra> we can't solve those with selinux or apparmor
[04:29:24] <aog> I solve that w/ NoScript in my browser :)
[04:29:42] <Khepra> that's insufficient tho :)
[04:30:33] <aog> user.js config? :D
[04:30:40] <Khepra> few months (or is it years?) ago there was a vuln in libpng. a crafted PNG would exec code in your firefox and avoid javascript to cause all kinds of messes.
[04:30:56] <Khepra> there are vulns in browsers where JS is not needed
[04:31:40] <Khepra> personally, I don't run noscript blockers because I have apparmor on FF and FF runs in a VM so there's the hypervisor boundary confinement
[04:31:41] <aog> then let's all just understand that we're all hacked no matter what, and live w/ it :))

[05:00:15] <Khepra> FinboySlick: the sasl socked by dovecot is set by the master root daemon, before privdrop. I don't know how courier behaves there
[05:00:27] <FinboySlick> Khepra: Same.
[05:01:01] <Khepra> postfix and dovecot are the only two daemons I still run as roots because they simply cannot function as unprivileged; cap_net_bind_service is insufficient
[05:01:17] <FinboySlick> I'm break-neck migrating an old installation before service cutoff so paradigm-shift isn't in the cards.
[05:02:01] <Khepra> FinboySlick: but with dovecot, you can set user and group ownership to "postfix", for the sasl socket. is that not the case with courier?
[05:02:02] <sney> littlebobeep: well, it hasn't been added to mentors yet, it might be a stale itp, if this is software that you use and are familiar with, you could be the best person to adopt and maintain it in debian.

[05:06:03] <Khepra> FinboySlick: so maildrop is run by postfix? via pipe?
[05:06:20] <FinboySlick> Yes.  I think it's connecting to the socket to get the home directory, not to authenticate.
[05:06:37] <Khepra> FinboySlick: ah. and courier is not running in that chroot
[05:06:51] <Khepra> or is it just about permissions?
[05:06:53] <FinboySlick> Not is maildrop
[05:07:30] <FinboySlick> It's just about permissions.  If I set /var/run/courier/authdemon 755, I'm good.  It's just a security issue.
[05:08:08] *** Joins: Arrowmaster (~Arrowmast@user/arrowmaster)
[05:08:22] <FinboySlick> (maildrop is not running in chroot)
[05:08:23] <Khepra> FinboySlick: perhaps ACLs could help?
[05:08:44] <Khepra> if maildrop is not in chroot, how is it invoked by chroot'ed postfix?
[05:09:17] <Khepra> FinboySlick: anyhoo with ACLs you can go beyond simple users and groups on a file, into a list of users and groups that can additional rwx the file
[05:09:22] <FinboySlick> I'm not sure.  But it definitely is reaching a socket (if I set permissions right) that is outside the chroot.
[05:09:27] <Khepra> and after the migration, consider that paradigm shift :)
[05:09:52] <Khepra> setfacl(1) ftw
[05:10:41] <Khepra> you can ran setfacl in an drop-in ExecStart for whichever service sets up the socket, so this persists across service restarts
[05:10:46] <Khepra> *run
[05:11:13] <FinboySlick> Khepra: Well, at that stage, I can just chmod.  My issue with it is that since this is on tmpfs, it breaks every reboot and the 'proper' way to fix that will get overriden when courier-authlib gets updated.
[05:11:45] <Khepra> FinboySlick: hence the drop-in ExecStart to persist the permission
[05:12:14] <FinboySlick> Khepra: Service startup files won't get overwritten on updates?
[05:12:14] <Khepra> FinboySlick: chmod is broad. user, group (that one group) or all.   ACLs can pinpoint just one user accessing the file.
[05:12:33] <Khepra> FinboySlick: not with drop-ins, or whole unit overrides under /etc/systemd/system/
[05:12:48] <Khepra> just don't touch /lib/systemd/ files
[05:13:33] <FinboySlick> Khepra: OK, that's one thing to consider.  What I'd *really* like though is to understand why just putting the vmail user in the courier group didn't solve the issue.
[05:14:51] <Khepra> because that's not how permissions work.   if you have  vmail:vmail  process   accessing   root:courier      file, then it won't work, even if vmail is in courier group
[05:14:54] <Khepra> the process isn't
[05:15:19] <Khepra> you need vmail:courier process to access file objects that permit the "courier" group in any capacity
[05:15:37] <Khepra> so instead, write an ACL that permits vmail group to rw the courier's socket
[05:17:28] <Khepra> for example....    setfactl -m u:vmail:rw /var/run/courier/authdaemon/whatsocketisthat    ; this permits user vmail to rw that path, regardless of default user:group rwx permissions on the file itself.
[05:17:37] <Khepra> *setfacl
[05:18:02] <FinboySlick> OK.
[05:18:35] *** Joins: hinderaker (hinderaker@user/hinderaker)
[05:19:44] <FinboySlick> In your opinion, is the socket path created by the process itself or by systemd when it gets started?
[05:20:08] <Khepra> it's created by systemd ONLY if there's a .socket unit and the thing works with socket activation

[05:21:56] <FinboySlick> (btw, I hope you don't mind me picking your brain here.  I'm taking the opportunity to learn beyond just making it work)
[05:22:41] <Khepra> systemd creates dirs in /run/ if configured with something like RuntimeDirectory= directive . /var/run should be symlinked to /run but I don't know if that promise remains under chroot
[05:23:13] <Khepra> postfix chroot debian specific really and is ancient technology that predates systemd. a lot of syastemd things break in that chroot. I always disable it
[05:23:23] <wez> FinboySlick: Why are you after an opinion for? Wouldn't you rather the facts?
[05:23:31] <FinboySlick> I don't think chroot is involved since this is for courier which isn't under chroot.
[05:23:46] <Khepra> ah right
[05:24:05] <Khepra> FinboySlick: well is /var/run symlinked?
[05:24:16] <FinboySlick> wez: Facts were abolished a few years ago. It's all opinions now ;)

[05:26:28] <Khepra> FinboySlick: so check the service unit if it predefines the dir(s). also there could be tmpfiles entries, but... I doubt it. other than toplevel {/var}/run/courier directory, anything inside is likely just created by courier. that would be typical behaviour
[05:26:37] <Khepra> anyhoo good luck, my shift's over, I gtfo

[05:27:26] <Khepra> systemctl cat courier.service  (if that's the unit)

[05:28:02] <littlebobeep> sney: Yeah I would not mind packaging it but my SMTP server is down and it seems I need this to package in Debian
[05:28:18] <Khepra> that systemctl cat is important because unlike regular cat, it gives you the final state after vendor units + etc overrides and dropins
[05:28:49] <Khepra> like, this is the unit that systemd effectively sees, after combining all possible paths

[14:06:56] <Haohmaru> the program has actions when you click while holding alt, but they can't work because something is stealing them

[14:09:00] <Khepra> could also be bad debian default. iirc i3wm for example is defaulting meta to alt, while it "should" (and I configure it) for the windows key.

[16:38:37] <cluelessperson> I'm interested in helping debian adopt docker for apt repository mirroring and synchronization
[16:39:18] <Khepra> "help debian" and "adopt docker" is don't belong in the same sentence :)
[16:39:53] <Haohmaru> he had no clue
[16:40:02] <cluelessperson> Khepra, what do you have against docker?
[16:40:37] <jelly> cluelessperson, what's the problem with current apt repository mirroring and sync that you're trying to solve?
[16:41:04] <Haohmaru> the lack of docker ;P~
[16:41:19] <Khepra> cluelessperson: my biggest problem is when all you ahve is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. containerization and dockerization should be done only if there's no alternative for proper process setup
[16:41:28] <cluelessperson> jelly, I find it extremely difficult and confusing to use.  It seems to be a collection of custom scripting with unclear configuration, usage, and deployment.
[16:41:40] <cluelessperson> The purpose of docker is to containerize and solve all that
[16:41:56] <Khepra> and if containerization IS required, to isolate dependencies (which I am sure is NOT a requirement for apt repos), then docker is the least of the acceptable containerization tehcnologies
[16:42:04] <jelly> it's ftpsync for the official mirrors, you have one config file and one cron job
[16:42:17] <jelly> and like, rsync as a dep
[16:42:53] <cluelessperson> yeah, it's not "just" though.
[16:43:01] <cluelessperson> well you didn't say just, but still
[16:43:01] <jelly> it's manual but I wouldn't call it an extremely difficult task
[16:43:03] <Haohmaru> i don't even use apt a lot, what exactly is the problem for real? like an example..
[16:44:07] <cluelessperson> I'm of the opinion that base servers should have minimal configuration/services running, and that applications should be neatly contained and deployed in a fairly universal and reliable fashion.
[16:44:11] <jelly> the most difficult part is finding a mirror to sync from and talking to their admin

[16:46:12] <Khepra> containerization is very much abused these days. almost like a hype and fear of being fired if you don't do containers.   in reality, they serve literally only ONE purpose:  isolation of binary dependencies. nothign else. thery're not even security boundaries.

[16:47:46] <cluelessperson> The reason docker is so hyped, is because it makes it so incredibly easy to run and scale things together.
[16:48:10] <Khepra> for a price
[16:48:11] <Kingsy> hmm weird issue. youtube videos wont play on any browser on my system.. anyone seen this before?
[16:48:23] <jelly> cluelessperson, what effin scale?  a debia mirror is http server and 2TB of data
[16:48:45] <Khepra> Kingsy: something something gpu issues. maybe disable hw acceleration, it's in Settings, performance, unselect recommended and hw accel checkbox appears, deselect it

[16:49:36] <Kingsy> Khepra: didnjt make a difference.
[16:49:37] <Khepra> this right here is literally proof that people will apply containerization where it is NOT needed in any shape or form.

[17:42:27] <Khepra> it breaks because it introduces a whole new python version, which is incidentally the same major version already packaged, so pyenv'ing 3.5 on a system with 3.5 already is STUPID
[17:42:34] <cluelessperson> Not to the SYSTEM.
[17:42:41] <drzacek> cluelessperson, is it about that thingy that build new python? yeah personally I wouldn't mind, afaik separate python versions can coexist (? not 100% sure), but it looks like there was other reason why that didn't worked in my case
[17:43:03] <Khepra> and yes I know you can do that in a ~/ non-system dir, so it doesn't mes with system python but that's the thing. you'll have venvs with gods know which python stored godsd know where and ... no. useless, breaks things.
[17:43:43] <Khepra> drzacek: ONLY if you need different python version than what's packaged, is the pyenv advice sound. do you need 3.7 or 3.9 or anything other than 3.5?
[17:43:49] <cluelessperson> drzacek, pyenv builds python versions from source, and you can shim the binaries in wherever you need them, I don't suggest doing that for your system, just for your projects.

[17:47:16] <drzacek> an unrelated (kind of) question - if I would like to have a local repo, like on pendrive, to update the offline systems, can I put everything in one single repo, along with the security and stretch-updates, into one repository?
[17:48:06] <Khepra> drzacek: not sure I understand your question, but there's apt cacher and apt mirroring

[17:49:29] <Khepra> drzacek: sounds to me like you have a big configuration issue there, omitting the updates and security repos, so perhaps solve that problem first, and then see if the apt cacher sufficies for your use case

[17:50:22] <cluelessperson> drzacek, a lot of package managers support downloading packages (and dependency trees) into a directory,  but you'll probably run into the problem of knowing what packages each server needs specifically.   Especially if they're in different states from each other.

[17:56:12] <cluelessperson> drzacek, another way to go about it is to use the generally distributed ISOs and update packages off those, but again, you should probably be aware of what distro state things are in.
[17:58:17] <drzacek> omg it installed that fsck ing venv
[17:58:42] <Khepra> drzacek: now do you know how to "activate" it and/or use it further?

[17:59:24] <drzacek> Khepra, yes
[17:59:28] <Khepra> drzacek: also be VERY careful about pypi package names you use with pip. there's a rather.... large... problem with typo-squatted malware in those third party repositories....

[18:07:40] <Khepra> learned my lesson. from now on we used packaged modules wherevre possible, and testing of upgrade to bookworm will go along with other testing, all at once, with gradual changes.
[18:08:25] <drzacek> isn't this the whole point of venvs, so the system can stay stable on distro-provided packages, but various projects can use newer versions or different python package versions autonomously?
[18:09:09] <Khepra> no
[18:09:22] <Khepra> the point of vens is to isolate dependncies between projects
[18:09:44] <Khepra> AND to introduce different versions of python modules, than the ones packaged, AND to install modules that aren't packaged

[18:10:08] <Khepra> using venvs and pip installing from pypi, shifts the ENTIRE maintenance burden to you. you have to test upgrades, and care for security fixes
[18:10:40] <Khepra> which means you'll have to make decisions whether to bump entire pypi version of the package, or backport only the fixes.
[18:10:54] <Khepra> bumping entire versions brings NEW functions, deprecates existing functions and introduces new bugs
