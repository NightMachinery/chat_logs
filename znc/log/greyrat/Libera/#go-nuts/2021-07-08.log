[00:50:14] <shka> hey guys i am having problems wrapping my head around pointers to arrays
[00:51:35] <frm> what is unclear, more specifically?
[00:52:20] <shka> so i have code that uses defer on an pointer to array, and later i am calling append with that array a bunch
[00:52:23] <lazyreader> A slice is already a pointer to a backing array; you likely don’t actually want a pointer to a slice
[00:52:30] <CommunistWolf> you don't tend to call append to arrays
[00:52:36] <CommunistWolf> do you have a slice?
[00:52:58] <shka> CommunistWolf: it is an example to understand how it works
[00:53:06] <CommunistWolf> also note that append doesn't mutate a slice, it returns a new slice
[00:53:15] <shka> yeah, exactly
[00:53:38] <shka> so my expectation is that stuff like s = append(s, 1) will allocate new array
[00:54:04] <shka> but that array seems to have the same address as the old one!
[00:54:18] *** Joins: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex)
[00:54:35] <frm> append() might return a different slice than s. slices can grow dynamically.
[00:55:00] <shka> var s []int is an array, not a slice, no?
[00:55:03] <CommunistWolf> sometimes it will, sometimes it won't
[00:55:10] <CommunistWolf> no, that's is a slice
[00:55:14] <shka> ooh, ok
[00:55:16] <CommunistWolf> var s [12]int is an array
[00:55:22] <shka> gotcha!
[00:55:23] <frm> it's a slice, for array you need to specify the length in the type name
[00:55:35] <shka> ok, just let me check this
[00:55:53] *** Quits: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex) (Client Quit)
[00:55:57] *** Quits: Kane (~Kane@2a01:e34:ee89:5d90:7053:bb63:fdaa:21d2) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:56:02] <shka> yeah, this makes sense
[00:56:16] <CommunistWolf> append will mutate the backing array, including resizing or moving it if necessary, but not change the slice you pass it which contains the pointer to that array
[00:56:31] <CommunistWolf> in general, you won't go wrong if you always discard the slice you input into appendf
[00:56:46] <shka> ok, much cleaner
[00:56:46] <CommunistWolf> s = append(s, 0) or so, each time
[00:56:58] <shka> then what about defer semantics?
[00:57:22] <CommunistWolf> I don't think there's anything defer-unique about that
[00:57:23] <shka> it captures the current value into it's own mini scope/closure if i understand correctly
[00:57:50] <shka> no, this is independent, it just popped up at the same time for me
[00:58:16] <frm> if you defer a call to an anonymous function, you create a closure, yes. but it would be easier to understand if you would just share a snippet of code ;)
[00:58:29] <shka> good point
[00:58:57] <shka> let me just clear this
[01:00:14] <shka> ok, here it is
[01:00:15] <shka> https://gist.github.com/sirherrbatka/cfecde2288b027e71f4bc549acc23b79
[01:00:34] *** Joins: add_alias-LUA (~add_alias@2601:203:c200:d6f0:2d33:506:5f01:fb2c)
[01:00:42] <shka> the defered println will print just []
[01:01:35] <shka> which seems to indicate to me that defer establishes closure capturing the s value
[01:02:06] <shka> and the subsequent changes of the s are isolated
[01:02:13] <CommunistWolf> https://play.golang.org/p/vTbZu-A7fLG
[01:02:32] <CommunistWolf> you can do either
[01:02:53] <CommunistWolf> e.g. https://play.golang.org/p/RAExi9iN6sA
[01:03:15] <CommunistWolf> you can also use named return values for anything you need the defer to mutate, although I try to avoid that as well
[01:03:20] <shka> uh, this works exactly in the exact opposite way i would expect it
[01:03:40] <CommunistWolf> I'm not even going to pretend I know *why* it works
[01:03:57] <shka> ok, let me think about it for the second
[01:04:19] <CommunistWolf> I guess it comes down to when the function body is executed
[01:04:30] <CommunistWolf> or evaluated, or whatever
[01:04:43] <shka> so if i construct explicit closure, i am getting the lisp style closure, sharing the lexical env...?

[01:05:01] <shka> and defer itself is doing java style closure?
[01:05:09] <CommunistWolf> *shrug*
[01:05:12] * shka shakes head
[01:05:12] <frm> this is how defer works according to https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements
[01:05:27] <shka> to tired to investigate this now
[01:05:28] <frm> "Each time a "defer" statement executes, the function value and parameters to the call are evaluated as usual and saved anew but the actual function is not invoked."
[01:06:07] <shka> ok, so it kinda creates a java style of closure
[01:06:28] <frm> so, in your snippet (shka) the value of s is evaluated at that point in time, but subsequent statements create a new copy of the closure to expand its backing array
[01:06:46] <shka> yup, it all clear now
[01:07:03] <shka> thanks guys!
[01:07:10] <frm> you're welcome!
[01:08:37] <lazyreader> Pointers to slices are weird. You generally do not want a pointer to a slice.
[01:09:07] <shka> lazyreader: i want in this case, i have bunch of open files in a slice, i want to ensure that they are will get closed
[01:09:25] *** Quits: frm (~frm@user/frm) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:09:50] <CommunistWolf> I'd just line up a bunch of separate defer statements for each one
[01:09:52] <shka> and my initial approach was just simply use defer closeAllFiles(files)
[01:10:01] <lazyreader> A slice is already a pointer to a backing array.
[01:10:05] <shka> but surprise, no files are getting closed
[01:10:38] <CommunistWolf> in general, go gets awkward when  you start getting fancy
[01:10:50] *** Joins: snoel (~snoel@ss11.shee-consultants.net)
[01:11:04] <lazyreader> (I wish this were different, it’s a weird case of an implementation detail being very foot-gun for users)
[01:11:15] <shka> honestly, i have mixed feelings for go
[01:11:30] <shka> it works remarkably well for what i am doing right now
[01:11:41] *** Joins: frm (~frm@user/frm)
[01:11:57] <shka> but it is very much an unix style of program - stream goes in, stream goes out
[01:12:28] *** Joins: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex)
[01:12:36] <shka> and i am not convinced i would pick it for something anything complex
[01:12:45] <shka> but as a C with GC it is just fine
[01:12:48] <lazyreader> Just add defers to the places you open the files. Don’t add the file pointers to a slice over time and then defer an action on the slice.
[01:13:00] <CommunistWolf> go has many many footguns
[01:13:21] <CommunistWolf> pays the bills though
[01:13:23] <lazyreader> Go discourages clever code, which has its ups and downs
[01:13:36] <lazyreader> Sometimes clever is very satisfying!
[01:13:49] <frm> still less footguns than other languages out there ;)
[01:13:49] <shka> in this case, i will stick to slice
[01:13:50] <lazyreader> but it doesn’t fit how go “wants” you to write it.
[01:13:58] <shka> there is more involved
[01:14:14] <lazyreader> Ok, I suppose forewarned is forearmed.
[01:14:57] <CommunistWolf> soon: for _, file := range files { go file.Close() }
[01:15:35] <CommunistWolf> not so bad being paid for half a day to work that out

[15:55:45] <iivvoo> having very little succes - this versioning really is a pain when it's out of your own control
[15:55:46] <iivvoo> version "v7.0.1" invalid: module contains a go.mod file, so major version must be compatible: should be v0 or v1, not v7

[15:58:03] *** Joins: frost (~frost@59.71.241.179)
[16:00:01] <bookworm> it means that if you really want to use v7 you need to say so by adding /v7 in your go.mod file

[16:01:19] <bookworm> https://golang.org/doc/modules/major-version
[16:01:34] <iivvoo> right, so I previously depended on a non-versioned package, so just github.com/org/repo, which gave me v5.x.y
[16:02:08] <iivvoo> I cloned the repo (from master), fixed a bug, sent a PR but meanwhile they introduced v7? Makes me wonder why it wasn't /v5 before then
[16:03:50] <bookworm> it only applies when modules are used, else you get a pseudo version instead
[16:04:06] <bookworm> as soon as a package has a go.mod file, go assumes that semver is in place
[16:04:28] <iivvoo> hmm, does that mean the added the go.mod after the v5.x.y version I used originally?
[16:04:32] <bookworm> and hence bumping the major version is a breaking change and needs to be explicit

[21:52:21] <fizzie> FWIW, the stdlib `flag` package does *allow* two dashes as well. It just doesn't do short options, and also allows the single-dash form.
[21:52:40] <fizzie> But if you just care about being able to type `foobar --conf .config/foobar/conf`, it's sufficient for that.

[21:54:53] <KirkMcDonald> The first thing I ever wrote for Go was an attempt to replicate Python's optparse.
[21:54:57] <KirkMcDonald> It was terrible.
[21:55:11] <KirkMcDonald> But I'm also pretty sure it was the first third-party Go package ever published.
[21:55:33] <ikke> There is also a python argparse like module
[21:55:57] <KirkMcDonald> (argparse was not yet a going concern when I wrote this thing.)
[21:57:16] <KirkMcDonald> Sadly, I published it on... Geez, Google Code, probably. I'm pretty sure it is no longer online.
[21:57:51] <KirkMcDonald> But, as I said, it was terrible, and this is no great loss.

[22:03:50] <KirkMcDonald> That library was mostly an experiment in trying to do awful things with Go's type system.
[22:04:01] <siXy> KirkMcDonald: I like how you committed .hg/ in there too :)
[22:04:11] <KirkMcDonald> I don't think I did.

[22:04:32] <siXy> ah, that could very well be yeah.
[22:05:21] <KirkMcDonald> But some notable historical factoids: As far as I know, that's the first package that anyone ever published in Go. It predates such things as semicolon insertion and gofmt.
[22:05:53] <KirkMcDonald> It also predates the 'go' utility, and uses the old Makefile solution for building Go code.
