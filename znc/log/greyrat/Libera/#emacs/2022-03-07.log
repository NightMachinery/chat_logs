[01:54:17] <homerj> It makes sense to consider that the splits are just dependent of your current window
[01:54:34] <homerj> so if you want to split either the top or the bottom, change to that one before you split it again
[01:54:43] <lemacs_zzz> when I do: split-window-vertically, then split-window-horizontally, I end up with: top-left, top-right, and bottom windows

[01:55:48] <twrk> horizontally then vertically... I don't agree with the names
[01:56:12] <ski> lemacs_zzz : so do it in the other order ?
[01:56:20] <lemacs_zzz> it's the name of the commands on emacs D:
[01:57:07] <lemacs_zzz> ski I want to know in case I already have two window (top/bottom) and want a third window on the side of both of these windows

[01:57:24] <twrk> everyone's understanding of things is different. I always have people telling me "i dont understand what you're saying" anyway. but yeah, split "horizontally" then "vertically"
[01:57:27] <ski> remove one of the windows, then split the other way first
[01:58:10] <lemacs_zzz> ski that's one workaround
[01:58:22] <ski> that's a solution to what you were asking about
[01:59:22] <ski> "in case I already have two window (top/bottom)" -- remove one of those two windows. "and want a third window on the side of both of these windows" -- then use `C-x 3' to split horizontally, then `C-x 2' to split vertically
[01:59:32] <ski> what's hard to understand ?
[02:00:21] <ski> (and `C-x 1' or `C-x 0' should work, for the first step)
[02:00:22] <lemacs_zzz> I understand, the problem with that is that I'll have to switch buffer again after removing one of the windows
[02:00:56] <ski> i don't know a way around that

[09:31:18] <twb> I remember when that launched I was flipping channels and on commercial TV they had some weird like swan lake type dance thing in a football stadium
[09:31:35] <twb> and I watched for like 5 minutes and went "weird they're using what looks like xbox colors and logo"
[09:31:51] <twb> and a few minutes later was like 'is this... a 2 hour long ad for xbox?"
[09:32:09] <twb> featuring like the moscow ballet company
[09:32:15] <bpalmer> With such cruel words can ballet be dismissed. "Swan lake type dance thing"
[09:32:36] <twb> bpalmer: well I wasn't sure what terms you lot would undertand
[09:32:54] <bpalmer> "the dance with the tip toes"
[09:33:07] <twrk> the dance of the tip toes lol
[09:33:32] <twb> I mean, *I* saw swan lake in performed in beijing by the national ballet company
[09:34:24] <codingquark> Good morning!
[09:35:06] <bpalmer> I am curious to see how Russian ballet gets through this; apparently Russian opera stars were mostly choosing a pro-invasion stance so they were getting uninvited from events left and right (although now with sanctions, that may not be optional anymore)
[09:35:24] <bpalmer> But I'm not sure if ballet is as tied in to the moneyholders.

[16:35:11] <bremner> We need an equivalent of "commonwealth", but for the previous USA-ian empire.

[20:21:04] <bpalmer> well, I don't see an obvious answer. You might experiment with edebug and stepping through the loop, examining the buffer list on each pass through
[20:21:16] *** Joins: arescorpio (~arescorpi@2802:8010:4000:e000:9917:75c2:b6bb:eccf)
[20:21:51] <mfiano> Yeah, I think I'll just use (project-kill-buffers t) which accomplishes the same thing.
[20:22:00] <bpalmer> the heart of project-kill-buffers is simply (mapc 'kill-buffer buffs)
[20:22:15] <mfiano> I am by no means an elisp and especially edebug expert. I'm a CL-er :)
[20:23:03] <wasamasa> CL-er? I hardly knew 'er
[20:23:06] <bpalmer> edebug is pretty easy to use in the basics. edebug-defun, it will then breakpoint when the function is entered, hit space on each form and it's evaluated. In between it, you can do things like C-x C-b to look at buffers
[20:23:18] <rpav> it's decently similar these days, minus the nice tools of sly/slime
[20:23:28] <bpalmer> when you're tired, there's something to hit to make it run until death, and then you just evaluate the defun again to get rid of instrumetnation
[20:25:18] <bpalmer> At any rate. Time to debug my own breakages.

[20:41:30] <rpav> what i really should do is have a "major" and "minor" branch and make lots of little commits to the minor branch, then merge to the major branch at bigger checkpoints .. and while this sounds like the usual workflow, the major branch is the _feature_ branch

[20:42:22] <subopt> I need to map out many thousands of lines of code (SystemVerilog mostly) written over the last few years by design engineers who don't understand OOP. There's lots of copy/paste/modify, repeated misuse of enums that the compiler has let slide. etc. There aren't any tools to do this for me (none the client's willing to buy, that is). Wondering if there's a way to do it incrementally in emacs. Tried using
[20:42:22] <subopt>  bookmarks+, but that didn't pan out. Considered org-mode's file link facility, but can't modify everyone's code w/o facing a tribunal. Any suggestions for doing this with emacs? or with any other foss tools?
