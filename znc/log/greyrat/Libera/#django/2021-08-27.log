[01:01:21] <MrGlass> Hello! I'm encountering a weird error in my tests. I have an extra, unmanaged model used for testing some mixins that doesn't actually touch the DB. For some reason cleanup is breaking, and it's trying to delete the (nonexistent) table in my DB, even though I have managed=False in the class meta. Any ideas?

[15:17:37] <bananahead> Hi all - does anyone have a good detailed resource for when I should create custom managers and querysets, and more importantly which one to modify depending on certain usecases.
[15:18:56] <bananahead> I've read a fair few articles, seen a few videos, but there's that final hurdle I'm struggling to understand about which one to use and when.
[15:26:07] <dodo> bananahead: my managers are almost always just a thin layer between model and queryset, any query logic belongs in the queryset

[17:06:35] <ruffni> are there any more specific hints out there on how to use formsets with modelforms with initial data? i seem to be unable to wrap my head around it atm and skimming through the docs for a couple o hours now (to no avail)
[17:08:04] <duoi> bananahead_ you would use custom managers whenever you want the actions of a queryset to be modified, or if you want to add your own
[17:09:02] <duoi> for the former, say you have a model called Users and you want to create a proxy model called Teachers. You can override the get_queryset method to always filter `type='Teacher'` so you can just do Teacher.objects.all() and get back only teachers
[17:09:22] <GinFuyou> ruffni, what is the problem, I thought it was straight-forwardly documented?
[17:10:03] <duoi> for the latter, say you want to introduce a new method: unique_or_create where it will only create that record if there isnt one that exists in the database. You would subclass the model manager and add that method, and then you can Model.objects.unique_or_create(**params)

[17:22:31] <GinFuyou> as far as I remember you just pass a list of initial dicts...
[17:25:07] <ruffni> yeah, that usually works fine, but now i also need to pass an object from which some choices are determined. so i subclassed BaseModelFormSet, overloaded __init__ (which just saves one element passed as kwarg) and returns super().__init__(**kwargs). now i get: FooFormFormSet has no attribute 'get'
[17:27:29] <ruffni> s/saves one element/sets one self attribute/

[19:47:12] <Azelphur> Hey folks, I have a model which contains links to images on AWS (Lets call it Images), and it ForeignKeys (with on_delete=models.CASCADE) to User. When a User is deleted, I need to fire off a request to delete all the images to AWS. My initial idea was to hook the User pre_delete signal, and use that to delete all the images at AWS, however, I've found that the pre_delete signal for all the Images is fired before the User
[19:47:12] <Azelphur> signal. Anyone have any good suggestions on how to approach this problem?

[19:53:57] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[19:54:13] <Azelphur> Yes, because I have a signal on Image to delete the image from AWS too, so instead of sending off one request to delete all the images, it sends one request per image.
[19:54:21] <GinFuyou> you have to delete related items first, since there will be no object for them to refer if you do it other way around
[19:55:57] <Azelphur> Indeed, whereas in this case I kinda need things to work the other way around lol, I need my signal to ideally fire before any cascade deletes. I've hooked pre_delete but that seems to not be early enough.

[19:57:30] <GinFuyou> Hook it into delete methods?
[19:57:52] <GinFuyou> It's kind of dirty, but well, signals are not the cleanest solution anyway
[19:58:18] <Azelphur> Might be the only option, I was concerned about it because I know the delete method isn't called in all circumstances
[19:58:21] <GinFuyou> and cleanup looks quite fitting to be a part of deletion sequence
[19:58:36] <dang`r`us> write a custom delete_user function
[19:58:46] <dang`r`us> put it on the User model
[19:58:48] <GinFuyou> Yes, there can be 2 deletes, model and queryset
[19:59:25] <Azelphur> Does Model.delete get called if you queryset.delete()?
[19:59:30] <GinFuyou> yeah, if you can ensure deletes are always done through your function it's probably better
[19:59:55] <GinFuyou> Azelphur, not if I remember it right
[20:00:08] <GinFuyou> I think it works kind of like update
[20:00:19] <Azelphur> Good to know, thanks for the suggestions, will have a think about it and figure out which works best in this circumstance :)
[20:00:20] <dang`r`us> Alan, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#overriding-model-methods  - if you do that, read this stuff anyway, but also
[20:00:25] <dang`r`us> > Overridden model methods are not called on bulk operations
[20:00:29] <Azelphur> Thanks folks
[20:00:37] <dang`r`us> so yeah that will require a bit of auditing and documentation
[20:00:45] <GinFuyou> but you can override queryset delete as well
[20:01:06] <dang`r`us> if you want to make it even tighter, have a separate gc() on orphaned aws files you periodically call
[20:01:27] <dang`r`us> GinFuyou, cascading delete tho
[20:02:05] <GinFuyou> Well, I don't know of perfect and pretty solution for it.
[20:02:24] <dang`r`us> ultimately there will always be escape hatches (raw_sql comes to mind)
[20:02:31] <dang`r`us> hence, auditing/docs
[20:03:15] <dang`r`us> I suppose having aws delete on both a custom method *and* delete signal won't hurt
[20:03:19] <dang`r`us> UUIDs etc bla
[20:03:34] <dang`r`us> just catch file not found (etc) and handle via no-op
[20:03:53] <GinFuyou> Well, you may want some emergency escape hatches anyway when something goes out of sync
[20:04:01] <dang`r`us> fo sure

[20:13:38] <dang`r`us> well, oh, hm, wait a sec.
[20:13:42] <dang`r`us> let me read what you wrote yesterday.
[20:14:11] <dang`r`us> "testing some mixins that doesn't actually touch the DB" - why do you need a model for that?
[20:14:51] <MrGlass> It's a model mixin that checks some filed things before save, I need to test that it's doing the save overide behavior I expect.
[20:15:01] <MrGlass> The regular mixin touches DB
[20:15:09] <MrGlass> but I dont need it to hit the db to test
[20:15:12] <MrGlass> (or so I thought)
[20:15:18] <dang`r`us> lemme think
[20:15:55] <dang`r`us> so you have SomeModel, and BeforeSaveMixin, and in testing you do a   class TestBeforeSave(SomeModel, BeforeSaveMixin) ?
[20:15:56] <MrGlass> It's a super weird bug. I was wrong, it's not on destruction. Some init in another test is doing a lookup for all objects in it
[20:16:17] <MrGlass> Eaxctly
[20:16:28] <MrGlass> THogh not SomeModel
[20:16:34] <dang`r`us> TestOnlyModel?
[20:16:35] <MrGlass> A new fakeModel
[20:16:37] <dang`r`us> ok
[20:16:44] <dang`r`us> why not make that managed?
[20:16:48] <dang`r`us> test uses a separate DB anyway
[20:16:52] <dang`r`us> it will not touch your regular db
[20:16:56] <MrGlass> So its literally fakeModel(mixin), and mixin inherits from base

[20:22:48] <dang`r`us> I'm thinking there's a 100% probability you will have an ActualAppModel(BeforeSaveMixin). Otherwise, what's the point :D  so ... I'd say: test this. Test ActualAppModel.
[20:23:32] <MrGlass> Yeah, that was plan C. OK.
[20:23:53] <MrGlass> (Plan B involved very weird monkey patching)
[20:24:05] <MrGlass> Thanks for the help!
[20:24:25] <dang`r`us> KISS reigns supreme :D
[20:24:27] <dang`r`us> yw!
[20:24:36] <MrGlass> I think when I wrote this we had no models.
[20:24:58] <MrGlass> So I did this for TDD
[20:25:03] <frozensoil> im new to irc, what's the best way to share code snippets?
[20:25:10] <dang`r`us> frozensoil, see topic
[20:25:21] <dang`r`us> http://dpaste.de/
[20:25:33] <frozensoil> dang`r`us: thanks
[20:25:38] <dang`r`us> (can you identify what the "topic" here is? it's a special line that's sticky/special to the channel)
[20:25:49] <dang`r`us> (it starts with "Welcome to #django" here)
[20:26:10] <frozensoil> yeah, I just installed irssi, so like this is a whole complete new set of stuff for me
[20:26:20] <dang`r`us> ok
[20:26:33] <frozensoil> I guessed that I could see the topic again by entering /topic :)
[20:26:36] <MrGlass> Welcome!
[20:26:46] <frozensoil> MrGlass: thank you!
[20:28:09] <dang`r`us> frozensoil, yup! also it should be the topmost line in your window, but probably truncated
[20:28:28] <dang`r`us> anyway, when using dpaste, it's best to select the language in the dropdown
[20:28:36] <dang`r`us> otherwise formatting/highlighting will be off.
[20:29:15] <frozensoil> dang`r`us: good to know, I need to get used to the keybindings, not even sure how to navigate to the top of the window :D
[20:29:28] <frozensoil> either that or get a mac osx specific irc client? what do you guys use?

[20:32:23] <spreadsheet> hello channel
[20:34:02] <spreadsheet> so, not trying to start any controversy here. but I just wanted to know if I'm missing anything in my assessment of express, django, and spring for backend
[20:36:14] <nedbat> spreadsheet: did you decide django was best? no controversy!
[20:36:15] <spreadsheet> from the perspective of a non-template user (using say, react frontend). express: good if your api server is mostly io, but bad for computationally expensive, also, lots of stuff not included out of the box. django: has auth, sessions, ORM, much more out of the box, also good, and has a lot more say ML libraries if you need to perform those computations. spring boot: has more out of the box but a lot more boilerplate to do the same
[20:36:16] <spreadsheet> things, boilerplate that seems to me to give an illusion of productivity
[20:36:55] <nedbat> spreadsheet: how did you decide on those three things to compare? you might have to provide more backstory about your project for people to help.
[20:37:08] <spreadsheet> not sure about django vs say, fastapi (I know fastapi uses a different execution model, similar to node's, handles more io requests)
[20:37:32] <spreadsheet> nedbat: these are the ones I've seen in my work experience. I know about other ones but I think these are representative of the top of each language
[20:38:42] <spreadsheet> oh, to add for spring boot: better if you do want to do some computationally intensive things compared to express
[20:39:45] <nedbat> spreadsheet: this channel can help with understanding django, we might not be able to help with other frameworks
[20:39:49] <spreadsheet> I see
[20:40:19] <spreadsheet> so this is more appropriate for ##programming ?
[20:40:39] <spreadsheet> I'll take it there
[20:40:48] <nedbat> spreadsheet: someone here might know, but ....

[20:50:00] <MrGlass> Thanks again dang`r`us, I ended up googling how to make a test only model. It's a bit of a hack (I'm checking for the word 'test' in sys.argv) but otherwise super easy. Just created a models file in tests folder, and then if tests add app.test to the apps list

[20:56:57] <frozensoil> i'm getting a weird error when trying to run an integration test with pytest: I am testing model a signals for which a side effect is triggered on model b. but when I run the test, I get an error telling me relation does not exist (as if the table of model b never gets created)

[20:59:13] <moldy> frozensoil: is there a migration for that model?
[20:59:24] <moldy> frozensoil: how does the test look like?
[20:59:28] <frozensoil> moldy: for model a and b, yes
[20:59:48] <moldy> does the code you're testing run too early, possibly (at module level)?
[21:00:43] <frozensoil> moldy: that could potentially make sense - it basically fails on the save of model b
