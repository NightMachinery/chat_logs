[00:21:59] <stagas> which doesn't change any behavior
[00:22:54] <stenno> where do you use switch fallthrough
[00:23:25] <stagas> i dont but the break was inside an if and it wasn't being handled
[00:23:48] <ljharb> stagas: switch fallthrough is poison and should never be used
[00:23:58] <ljharb> stagas: but also so is `switch` itself
[00:23:59] <stagas> so it was falling through to the other branch and took me some time to figure what's happening, then i was wondering why eslint didn't catch that, and it's turned off
[00:24:11] <stagas> in typescript's eslint recommended
[00:24:13] <systemfault> It will keep being used... until there's something better (pattern matching :p )
[00:24:14] <ljharb> well sure
[00:24:19] <ljharb> "recommended" configs are generally bad
[00:24:26] <stagas> so basically all typescript projects have fallthrough errors potentially
[00:24:45] <ljharb> all TS projects have tons of potential errors, TS can't even prevent runtime type errors in every case
[00:25:22] <PenguinMan98> Typescript bad?
[00:25:30] <austincheney> no, typescript is great
[00:25:38] <systemfault> stagas: Fallthrough is a "feature" (bad feature) of switches... I can't imagine being that disabled by a simple "recommended" preset.
[00:25:49] <systemfault> TS is pretty awesome.
[00:26:00] <systemfault> Especially used in a FP way...
[00:26:01] <stagas> systemfault: it's better to be explicit when you want a fallthrough with an eslint disable line comment, than to be bitten

[00:27:33] <stagas> yeah but the point here is you can fallthrough accidentally if the break is in a branch itself
[00:27:46] <austincheney> typescript is great in that allows solving a class of problems in a straight forward way that approach insanity in JavaScript at times of large refactors
[00:27:50] <stagas> and it's an error that's easy to happen and it's almost invisible
[00:27:52] <stenno> php has match-expressions which are not quite pattern matching but already pretty cool
[00:28:07] <stagas> because you see a block, you see the break, you expect there's no fallthrough
[00:28:13] <Alexendoo> It may be disabled in the eslint preset because no fallthrough is one of the handful of extra lints tsc has
[00:28:16] <austincheney> the benefits of typescript are not something that can be appreciated until you have really dived in on a project
[00:28:30] <Alexendoo> so it would be doubled up if enabled in tsconfig
[00:28:34] <ljharb> austincheney: i have really dived in on many projects

[00:29:09] <ljharb> austincheney: the implication that something is "obvious" if only a person had your experience, is not an intellectually honest way of communicating an opinion :-)
[00:29:12] <systemfault> austincheney: Otherwise, you end up with quite a few `any`s screwing up your application safety

[00:30:05] <systemfault> any is fine in generic type constraints, that's pretty much it.
[00:30:20] <ljharb> austincheney: then it must not be that obvious
[00:30:32] <ljharb> austincheney: things that are fully understood aren't hard to communicate
[00:30:35] <stagas> Alexendoo: but if you build with swc or esbuild or another then it's missed
[00:30:40] <ljharb> systemfault: why not `unknown` there
[00:30:40] <austincheney> systemfault, I use the TS rule that errors on any types even implicit any
[00:30:53] <ljharb> stagas: sure but, don't do that
[00:31:10] <Alexendoo> stagas: Well sure, but you'd also miss all the type errors
[00:31:24] <PenguinMan98> Assuming you care about type errors
[00:31:35] <Alexendoo> If you didn't, TS would be an odd choice
[00:31:44] <PenguinMan98> lol, indeed
[00:32:14] <systemfault> ljharb: unknown doesn't work in some cases, for example... a type alias with a generic parameter that is passed to another interface with a constraint
[00:33:13] <stagas> Alexandoo: it's taking 6 seconds for the tests to run with tsc, vs half a second with swc or sucrase
[00:33:20] <stagas> on the final build it's tsc sure

[00:46:48] <systemfault> Yeah, hehe
[00:47:05] <onosendi> You guys familiar with Fastify?
[00:47:32] <systemfault> No, but that one has been on my radar for a while... seems to be the only modern HTTP lib
[00:47:41] <obimod> i do appreciate the increased tone of patronization though :)
[00:47:43] <systemfault> The documentation looks okay
[00:47:51] <obimod> documentation always looks okay lol
[00:48:00] <obimod> actually, that is false
[00:48:36] <EdFletcher> onosendi: yeah i've used it on a couple projects, it's good stuff
[00:49:20] <EdFletcher> nest.js supports it as a first-party http foundation lib now too, which is nice (as i've grown to quite like nest)
[00:49:22] <systemfault> AFAIK, Express is slowly becoming a problem for the Node world... maybe they'll release something modern eventually, or slowly become irrelevant (Which is still going to take some time because of how popular it is)
[00:49:23] <onosendi> systemfault: I've been messing with it for a few weeks and I'm liking it. As far as documentation goes, it's been pretty bad for TypeScript.
[00:49:38] <systemfault> onosendi: Ah, that's sad.
[00:50:13] <EdFletcher> i don't pay much attention to express anymore since i found fastify, but why is it becoming a problem, lack of updates?
[00:50:42] <systemfault> EdFletcher: We're in the era of async/await, Express' default experience should reflect hat.
[00:50:55] <obimod> onosendi: i've used yup before, it's painless
[00:51:10] <EdFletcher> systemfault: hahaha ain't that the truth! in fact that's why i migrated to fastify in the first place, and it was literally the only motivation at that point
[00:51:32] <tempest> express-promise-router helps but yeah it needs an update to make it less of a hassle
[00:51:35] <obimod> anyone like koa?
[00:51:55] <EdFletcher> koa's nice too, but it's becoming an also-ran, ref: nest.js comment above
[00:52:12] <EdFletcher> i want something that is supported everywhere, and that's basically just express and fastify at this point
[00:52:44] <systemfault> NestJS is TS-centric and has a Java approach... it's simply not how I write my code.
[00:52:48] <onosendi> EdFletcher: any idea how to map schema validation error messages? Like: { username: 'Username is required', password: 'Password is required', }, etc? As of now, it's `message: 'body should have required property 'username', body should have required property 'password'` ?
[00:52:53] <systemfault> Well.. I say Java.. but really mean C#
[00:53:33] <obimod> onosendi: this is for a form?
[00:53:58] <onosendi> systemfault: it's fixed with express-async-handler, kind of a pain to wrap every handler with it, though.
[00:54:06] <EdFletcher> onosendi: hmmm no afraid not, have never used the explicit schema validation stuff (e.g. `addSchema()` right?) always have done that another way... have been meaning to look into it though
[00:54:09] <obimod> if so i'm a big fan of final-form (and react-final-form by extension)
[00:55:42] <onosendi> obimod: that would be validation on the frontend.. This would be in place of something like, Formik?
[00:55:56] <obimod> final-form saved me from formik
[00:56:04] <obimod> but yea
[00:56:29] <obimod> you're talking backend validation? yup sounds like a good way to go.

[01:10:34] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: no, you import the whole module with both
[01:10:44] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: the entire module is always evaluated
[01:11:02] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: you can do `if (condition) { x = require('x'); }`, but you can't do that with import
[01:11:08] <ThePhilgrim> systemfault: Would it actually be 'bar' or 'bar.js' ? :)
[01:11:11] <systemfault> There's one thing CJS doesn't have compared to ESM and it's the notion of "Default export/import"
[01:11:19] <systemfault> ThePhilgrim: "depends"
[01:11:23] <ThePhilgrim> ljharb: I see, interesting
[01:11:44] <ljharb> systemfault: no, CJS *only* has default.
[01:11:53] <ljharb> the thing ESM has that CJS doesn't is NON-default exports.

[01:12:36] <ThePhilgrim> Thanks for the great help guys! Going back to studying webpack!
[01:13:27] <systemfault> ljharb: I was seeing it differently because of module.exports being an object by default so people can do module.exports.someName = whatever;
[01:13:34] <systemfault> ljharb: But sure, it makes sense
[01:13:37] <obimod> I'm kind of dreading working on the bundle splitting stuff... my goal is have a "launcher" app PWA/TWA require various modules based on backend logic
[01:13:53] <ljharb> systemfault: sure, that's faking named exports. but it's still the object that's the single default export
[01:14:11] <ljharb> but ofc, named exports aren't actually good, and things should be deep-importing or deep-requiring what they need anyways
[01:14:22] <ljharb> obimod: that seems odd
[01:14:36] <ljharb> obimod: versus making a build process always statically include the right things based on config

[01:16:22] <obimod> ljharb: i'm thinking just using various entry points, and perhaps some webpack-specific variables to gate what is interpreted during which builds

[01:45:31] <onosendi> austincheney: Lie. Put Node in your corporate experience.
[01:47:03] <austincheney> thanks onosendi
[01:47:07] <PenguinMan98> Invent a company that represents your personal experience. Put that experience under that.
[01:47:28] <obimod> if i was hiring i would probably care more about your personal projects than corporate -- my recommendation is to publish code on github and link to it with a live demo
[01:47:35] <PenguinMan98> I, for example, put all of my personal development under 'Pengy Programming' but that entity doesn't exist outside of my resume.
[01:47:46] <ljharb> why is "corporate experience" a section at all
[01:47:52] <ljharb> just have an "experience" section. do not lie about anything.
[01:47:56] <obimod> nice PenguinMan98 -- that's a good idea
[01:47:58] <austincheney> PenguinMan98, I think they would see through that as I already indicate I hold two simultaneous employments (though I should probably just drop all mention of the military side job)

[08:47:44] <teut> how to keep it open?
[08:48:09] <teut> there is no keyboard shortcut for Take Screenshot
[08:48:30] <EdFletcher> there is indeed, which OS are you using?
[08:48:45] <teut> windows

[08:49:35] <teut> no no , not the screenshot of the desktop but the full web page
[08:49:40] <EdFletcher> or, you should be able to open that dropdown and then print the page as a PDF ("Microsoft Print to PDF" target)
[08:49:52] <EdFletcher> well if you have your browser open to that page and take a screenshot...
[08:50:21] <teut> oh yes that is good  , the pdf option
[08:50:28] <EdFletcher> 👍
[08:50:48] <teut> nope ctrl+P closes it
[08:52:08] <Neuromancer> you could always use something like sharex

[08:53:11] <EdFletcher> i mean again, there's screenshot tools built right into the OS

[08:53:30] <Neuromancer> true lol
[08:53:50] <teut> yes EdFletcher is correct
[08:54:17] <teut> nvm, I can concentrate on more important issues
[08:55:02] <EdFletcher> worst-case teut you could try to hack the site in the console to stop it from hiding that menu or just make it show up persistently, but that would be some work and as you note, this probably isn't all that important 🙂

[10:23:27] <sheetjs> oh
[10:24:10] <ljharb> from what i can read, if your package is included, then at publish time, only when the publisher lacks 2fa, they'll email you a one-time code to enter
[10:24:23] <ljharb> which seems fine, because it's not forcing 2fa for anyone always, only for publishing

[10:35:50] <gkatsev> unfortunately, based on docs it seems like CIDR lists are only allowed via CLI and automation tokens are only allowed via the UI
[10:36:12] <ljharb> you wouldn't want an IP restriction on the web
[10:36:26] <ljharb> for publish maybe, but i don't know if that exists
[10:37:09] <gkatsev> yeah, a token for publish for automation. Which is a thing now. But from what I can tell, you can't limit it via CIDR lists :(
[10:37:24] <friend> if I need to scale an element using JS instead of css, how can I modify it's top-left parameters to respect the css transform-origin if assigned?
[10:37:40] <gkatsev> automation tokens allow you to publish to a package even if the package normally requires 2FA for publish, iirc

[10:46:55] <gkatsev> I would *highly* recommend trying to do as much styling and related stuff in css as you can. And then for the things you can't avoid, use JS to set CSS.

[10:47:45] <theskillwithin> i agree with gkatsev

[10:49:01] <gkatsev> I mean, if you support the same platforms as jquery, it isn't a terrible idea to follow suit
[10:49:33] <gkatsev> but often you are supporting much newer stuff, so, you can definitely use newer things
[10:50:03] <gkatsev> using css is often the more performant than doing things in JS yourself

[10:53:07] <ThePendulum> sure, but thing like querySelector and CSS animations have been supported for a decade now, you'd have to be supporting some really legacy stuff
[10:53:09] <theskillwithin> also javascript has gotten a lot easier to use,  so if your using jquery because you think its easy, well ur probably shooting yourself in the foot a bit

[10:56:30] <theskillwithin> haha and it gets kinda cringe with jquery when your loading multiple versions of it to satisfy different scripts
[10:59:02] <friend> I'm writing a script for Adobe Illustrator that allows things to be aligned by reference points and various distribution methods.
[11:01:39] <friend> So I created a bounds object that uses getBoundingClientRect() for the getter (with some extra info added) and so now I am tring to tun that into a setter. I would like to be able to use the syntax item1.set_bounds({width:300, height:300, left:30, top:30}) while respceting the registration point or transform-origin
[11:02:49] <ljharb> oof, adobe JS
[11:03:03] <ljharb> can you try/catch in that yet?
[11:04:12] <friend> Doubt it. I'm just getting into it. I had a great idea for an alignment tool and before they will even hear me out, I have to have a working model using js. Alignment in Illustrator sux
[11:06:58] <friend> so while illustrator will export css, I don't think they are using it to scale elements in the app. Not sure though, so I'll check. THanks for the advice in general.

[11:11:07] <ljharb> which, to be fair, was many years ago
[11:11:20] <friend> I figured if I could make a simple html example that showed how the alignment tool should work, it could be ported to adobeJS pretty easily. I am gonna pitch it to Astute first, then Adobe. So im not worried about performance or effecient refactoring or anything other than making a limited demo work.
[11:11:25] <ljharb> but if in the 2010s they don't have a JS feature added in 1996, i'm not sure how much to expect

[11:16:55] <theskillwithin> "debug"
[11:16:58] <betterOn1> so i would use single quote to not escape them

[12:48:04] <Maxdamantus> I guess the axios one is a couple of lines shorter, but it involves an extra dependency.

[13:02:23] <Assault> Maxdamantus, theskillwithin: I was AFK..yeah so I need to send very large files and ensure their upload to server. So retrying a failed file chunk is what I would need.
[13:02:49] <Assault> So i guess in that case I need some JS magic on the client side
[13:03:45] <Maxdamantus> Assault: for that you'd probably need to look into splitting the `File` (which is a `Blob`) and sending those individual `Blob`s, appended to some `FormData` object like the various examples above.
[13:04:15] <Maxdamantus> and you'll need to check for success of uploading that part, then upload the next part, etc.
[13:04:31] <Maxdamantus> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/slice
[13:05:35] <Maxdamantus> Yep, so should be able to just do `const file = input.files[0];` then look at `file.size` and use `file.slice(0, 1048576)` etc to get the individual chunks.

[13:12:54] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: since your connection to the server is presumably gone.
[13:12:55] <theskillwithin> interesting
[13:13:55] <Maxdamantus> the multipart/form-data encoding is just a way of encoding all of the form inputs (including files) as a big array of bytes.
[13:14:27] <theskillwithin> streams are confusing to me,  but streams are just data in chunks?
[13:15:46] <Maxdamantus> so it has the simple form inputs first, which might look something like "name=Max&favourite_color=Yellow%20no%20wait%20blue", and then it has each file, preceded by a little header showing the content-type, boundary text and maybe content-length, then the content surrounded with the specified boundary before and after it.
[13:16:09] <Maxdamantus> Well, the thing that you're streaming in this case is just a bunch of bytes.
[13:16:23] <Maxdamantus> the HTTP body.

[13:20:00] <theskillwithin> of course the blob loblaw law blob
[13:20:03] <Maxdamantus> You can slice a file that's arbitrarily large, and a modern browser will just seek to the parts when you start the send.

[13:20:59] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus and it looks like you have to do that in the code, its not just taken care of
[13:21:31] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: do what? slicing? yes, because if you want to be able to resume an upload, you need to create your own protocol for that.
[13:22:52] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus I don't remember them asking for a resume feature,  just on large file upload
[13:23:24] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: no, it's taken care of by the browser.
[13:23:58] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: I've just tried it with a 300 GB file. The browser immediately starts uploading the file, doesn't try to load it all into memory.

[13:24:20] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus without the slice?
[13:24:21] <Maxdamantus> and if I select a 100 GB slice of it, that also works immediately.
[13:24:28] <Maxdamantus> Yes, with or without a slice.
[13:24:58] <theskillwithin> ahhh ok ic.  but that would suck if it failed half way thru,  then ud want the ability to resume
[13:25:22] <Maxdamantus> Right, so for that you'll need to invent your own protocol, which will involve slicing the file.
[13:25:35] <fweht> i use this library where i expect at some point to get an array, but i become an object with integers as keys, i always thought thats the same as an array, but apparently not?  what makes an object to an array?  length property?

[13:28:53] <fweht> Maxdamantus: yes thats what i thought
[13:29:14] <fweht> but why does `{'0': 'foo', '1': 'bar'}` need to become an array?
[13:29:19] <Maxdamantus> "2" is the real key used there. `2` semantically just gets turned into "2" (though in practice, implementations avoid that conversion)
[13:29:55] <fweht> my understanding was that arrays in js are just object with integer string key values (although an array can have additional keys and still be treated as an array)
[13:29:58] <Maxdamantus> fweht: if it's got a `.length` property, you can use `Array.from`

[17:58:04] <theskillwithin> i basically was trying to prove the same point you made back to you
[17:58:08] <theskillwithin> haha
[17:58:30] <stenno> you added a 'not'
[17:59:02] <theskillwithin> no, i copy and pasted it.  without changing the comment.   so the comment was from you, not me
[17:59:23] <stenno> dude you must stop the gaslighting
[17:59:28] <theskillwithin> i didn't see value in the comment, so i didn't bother paying attention to it
[18:00:30] <theskillwithin> stenno fuck you, look back, i pasted the same thing twice.  one with ? and one with out ?   and both have the same comment
[18:00:35] <stenno> yes
[18:00:49] <theskillwithin> obviously I didn't care to change the comment then
[18:01:01] <stenno> the code i wrote had the comment // this will throw
[18:01:24] <stenno> your pasted code had the comment // this will not throw
[18:01:41] <stenno> and then you berated me for claiming that that code will throw
[18:01:44] <theskillwithin> cuz i copied and pasted your code, without looking at the comment
[18:03:30] <stenno> ok so my comments were irrelevant to your statements afterwards
[18:03:36] <stenno> my code comments
