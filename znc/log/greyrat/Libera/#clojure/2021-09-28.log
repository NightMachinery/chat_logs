[16:52:53] <turlando> Don't worry, Discord will soon eat Slack
[16:53:05] <Para> Discord at least boots really fast.
[16:53:15] <goodger> it does?
[16:53:21] <goodger> oh dear
[16:53:22] <Para> Yeah, it's not an Electron app.
[16:53:35] <leah2> the discord webapp is super slow :/ it didnt use to be
[16:53:45] <turlando> I used Slack and I use Discord both from Firefox and it's day and night
[16:53:57] <Para> That's true, there's some slowness. It seems to be more impacted by load, Slack is just consistently sluggish :)
[16:54:14] <goodger> what's discord if not an electron app?
[16:54:42] <Para> I actually have to check that now.
[16:55:08] <goodger> the command line reported by htop for my copy of discord desktop looks very, very much like chromium flags
[16:55:09] <Para> Oh darn, Discord is an Electron app now.
[16:55:29] <Para> I think it didn't use to be. So maybe that's the source of what leah2 just said.
[16:55:45] <Para> Then the other dimension is that it seems to be more competent as an Electron app than Slack.
[16:56:05] <leah2> but i also use slack for years and it was faster back then in the browser
[16:56:06] <goodger> the webapp is definitely slow
[16:56:13] <Para> Hmm, I wonder if the brew distributed htop for MacOS still has that kernel panic bug in it...
[16:56:14] <turlando> Their webapp uses React I think and I've yet to find a React app that fast
[16:56:18] <leah2> now it's so slow i make typing errors...
[16:56:39] <Para> Yeah, React really isn't the framework for highly dynamic content.

[16:57:56] <goodger> I am 99% sure the electron version is identical to the webapp except for a handful of ‘system’ API stuff
[16:58:10] <Para> I used to work for Finnish National Agency for Education and we had a superdynamic form builder thingy there called ataru, which is 100% isomorphic Clojure and its biggest shortcoming is that at the end of the day React really just doesn't like being data-driven and dynamic :)
[16:58:12] <goodger> they both run equally badly on my system
[16:58:40] <Para> It works and is pleasing to develop, React just has an obvious hard limit after it sort of dies performance wise.

[18:50:38] <sobel> I'm starting to have opinions about React apps, based on my limited experience. You have to use more than a couple tools to make it not suck.
[18:51:31] <sobel> also, for apps facing the finance sector, omg do i regret going with a PWA. server rendered app would be so much easier to fit into a whitelist request. and they're all gonna have to whitelist us now.

[19:08:00] <Ingvix> I'm having hard time figuring whether I should make my function take a list or a vector as an argument. The contents would be pairs of partial functions and vectors which I intend to partition into actual pairs and then loop through the pairs doing stuff with them. Or does it matter at all in my case?
[19:08:39] <ToxicFrog> In your case I don't think it matters as long as it's seqable

[19:09:09] <ToxicFrog> It matters if you're conj'ing it but it doesn't sound like you are
[19:10:06] <sobel> EdwardIII: yeah, my clients behind institutional firewalls basically don't have internet access like residential
[19:10:16] <Ingvix> conj'ing?

[19:23:48] <Ingvix> though, ToxicFrog, if I were to conjugate which would be better to use then?
[19:25:04] <ToxicFrog> Depends on whether you want conj to put things on the front or the back :P
[19:25:15] <ToxicFrog> ,(conj '(:foo) :bar)
[19:25:21] <ToxicFrog> Oh, bot's missing :(
[19:25:35] <andreyorst> fear not, I will evaluate it for you
[19:25:48] <andreyorst> (:bar :foo)
[19:25:53] <andreyorst> here you go
[19:26:30] <ToxicFrog> But yeah, conj on a list prepends elements and conj on a vector appends them. Sometimes you care about which one it does, sometimes you don't.
[19:26:59] <andreyorst> and conj on a map requires you to pass a vector of key and value to add to the map
[19:27:20] <andreyorst> which is very convenient sometimes

[19:31:26] <Ingvix> I see
[19:31:30] <ridcully> Ingvix: my two cents: accept either, because things quickly become lazy sequences.  decide what you want to _return_ of that function rather.  e.g. vector (egaer), lazy seq, ...
[19:33:26] <Ingvix> I guess one could just use concat and put a new value where one wants to
[19:34:26] <Ingvix> if the was such a problem with lists and vectors in one's particular use case
[19:34:33] <Ingvix> *there
[19:41:07] <jeaye> concat is typically a red flag, since it's eager.
[19:41:32] <jeaye> lazy-cat is a safer default.
[19:42:28] <Ingvix> I see
[19:47:29] <ToxicFrog> I absolutely love the fact that clojure has a library function called "lazy-cat" and it's a shame I rarely have a reason to use it
