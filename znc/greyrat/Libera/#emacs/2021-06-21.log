[00:13:46] <mattbyname> hi i'm new to emacs and IRC... and i've spent a couple of hours now fighting with the different clients to get one to auto-login with the libera server and i'm having no luck. I was wondering if there's something going on to do with the specific set up of the new irc server and all the changes that might be responsible, or if I really am just getting it wrong? I've tried ERC, circe, and RCIRC 
[00:13:54] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Client Quit)
[00:14:25] <wasamasa> circe should just work with SASL
[00:14:37] <wasamasa> rcirc and ERC require extra hacking for SASL to work
[00:14:48] <wasamasa> SASL is mandatory for TLS connections to freenode
[00:15:05] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: sounds super specific
[00:15:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> SASL with external certs is also mandatory for Tor.
[00:15:51] *** Antlers is now known as antlers
[00:16:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though the only foolproof way to do that one would be to wrap the entire Emacs instance in torsocks.

[00:31:02] <mattbyname> that's interesting! i was surprised how sparse the documentation is on ERC. but then i think i'm spoiled on the emacs and org-mode manuals
[00:32:31] <contrapunctus> wasamasa: hm...as part of a package of other Elisp-buffer stuff? Such as another command which takes a predicate and hides all Lisp forms which don't match.
[00:32:42] <grift> has anyone gotten password-store to work with the pinentry package in melpa? last time i tried it kept trying to use the pinentry-tty which doesnt work with emacs-nox
[00:32:52] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: admit it, you don't like just writing a small helper function
[00:32:58] <fizeau> muradm: can't you use something like shell-command-to-string?
[00:34:04] <muradm> fizeau: for what?
[00:35:18] <fizeau> to capture the output of pass
[00:35:23] <contrapunctus> wasamasa: I know the latter could be really cool for browsing/editing large Lisp sources.
[00:35:26] <fizeau> and feed it to erc
[00:35:36] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: for you perhaps
[00:35:45] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: I keep mine tiny
[00:35:50] <muradm> fizeau: (pasword-store-get ...) is not good enough? :)

[00:36:44] <fizeau> muradm: i don't know i have not tested either of them just maybe it's another solution
[00:37:18] <muradm> it works fine, I was complaining on ERC docs advertising that auth-source should be picked up automatically, but that does not happen, so I have to supply :password with (password-store-get ...), ideally I would expect ERC do it for me via auth-source
[00:38:40] <fizeau> oh ok misread you
[00:39:42] <muradm> grift: how pinentry should work with password-store? pinentry enforcing input for pin, should not be automatable?

[01:41:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, it's a mix of sodium bicarbonate and some other acid. The bicarbonate is what does the soapy part.

[04:05:26] <kakuhen> Are you using latex for typesetting math papers?
[04:05:34] <talismanick> yeah

[04:07:10] <kakuhen> for some reason the indentation is messed up on this site, but copy pasting to emacs, selecting the region, and pushing tab will fix it
[04:07:32] <kakuhen> to briefly explain what this does: it sets up auctex as you want, but it also does not prompt you to save file when you decide to render a tex document
[04:07:45] <kakuhen> then it adds a hook to launch the rendered pdf (with pdf-tools) once the tex document is finished rendering
[04:08:06] <kakuhen> since pdf-tools is a heavy package, I defer loading it until a pdf file needs to be opened
[04:08:18] <talismanick> The error I always get with pdfs is "file changed on disk" nagging when I recompile
[04:08:33] <bremner> talismanick: autorevert works OK with pdf-tools
[04:08:47] <kakuhen> talismanicK: yeah there's a specific way you have to set up the hooks to prevent that error
