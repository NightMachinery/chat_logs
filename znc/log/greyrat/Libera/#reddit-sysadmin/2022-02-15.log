[05:00:39] <DoTheNeedful> Quote #221 (U:1/D:-2): <v​yz> welp boys just did my first ever raid 0 on a homelab server  [submitted by grumplestiltzkin on 2021-02-01 12:55:32 CST]
[05:01:18] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:01:18] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies like to eat manure, which is animal poop, or old garbage. Some of the germs from these materials can stay on their feet or mouth parts. When a fly lands on your food, those germs get on your food. Super disgusting!
[05:01:29] <mistiry> Super disgusting!
[05:01:33] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:01:33] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Over 100,000 species of flies live on earth!
[05:01:54] <DrGibby> Super interesting!
[05:02:00] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:02:00] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!
[05:02:27] <mistiry> Super shitty!
[05:02:30] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:02:30] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies lay their eggs on fruit, food, other animals and even rotting flesh. Their larvae are known as maggots. They look like bits of rice!
[05:02:50] <DrGibby> Super rice! 
[05:02:55] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:02:55] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies lay their eggs on fruit, food, other animals and even rotting flesh. Their larvae are known as maggots. They look like bits of rice!
[05:03:02] <mistiry> Super maggoty!
[05:03:04] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:03:05] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies carry disease. During the Spanish-American War, 5,000 soldiers died from typhoid, a disease spread by flies. Only 4,000 soldiers actually died in the war.
[05:03:24] <DrGibby> Super sick! 
[05:03:29] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:03:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.
[05:03:42] <mistiry> Super stalky!
[05:03:50] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:03:50] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.
[05:04:11] *** Quits: Hackerpcs (~user@user/hackerpcs) (Quit: Hackerpcs)
[05:04:16] <DrGibby> Super balanced!
[05:04:20] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:04:20] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.
[05:04:35] <mistiry> Super tasty!
[05:04:38] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:04:38] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they don’t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they don’t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.
[05:04:55] <DrGibby> Super breeders!
[05:04:59] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:04:59] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: How do house flies eat? A house fly will regurgitate digestive juices onto solid foods and these juices break down the food into small pieces, allowing them to use their mouthparts, called proboscis, to drink the meal.
[05:05:22] <mistiry> Super vomity!
[05:05:25] <mistiry> !flyfact
[05:05:25] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Over 100,000 species of flies live on earth!
[05:05:38] <DrGibby> Super species!
[05:05:43] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[05:05:43] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies live on a liquid diet! Yes, thats correct. Flies tend to live off a diet based on liquids. Why? Well, that’s just how they are built. See, they lack the mouthparts needed to chew food, so instead, they have to drink it.
[05:05:56] <mistiry> Super drunk!
[05:06:08] <mistiry> some good TIL's in there
[05:06:11] <mistiry> thanks DoTheNeedful!

[08:33:11] <misspwn> welp i am today years old to learn Crimea is not a gang 
[08:33:44] <monr0e> ...
[08:34:41] <monr0e> Have you heard no international news of the past seven years?
[08:35:02] <misspwn> plenty of international news but this is the first time there was an actual map
[08:35:30] <misspwn> blips here and there and it's gotten more intense so i start to get on the googles
[08:35:47] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Better than a rusty trombone
[08:36:14] <PattyCakes> the facade that is Russia will collapse harder than the USSR.
[08:36:25] <misspwn> Crimea was always framed to me as like a feud...not land
[08:36:47] <misspwn> i feel dumb about it but i'm glad to know
[08:37:13] <PattyCakes> I got lots of hearty giggles about the "mysterious" russian superyacht that disappeared overnight from a renovation dock in Germany
[08:37:33] <PattyCakes> what's when I knew that he is going to invade.
[08:37:49] <PattyCakes> s/what's/that's
[08:37:49] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "that's when I knew that he is going to invade."
[08:38:15] <Molnija> Crimea is sea access for ukraina
[08:38:46] <misspwn> they're pretty much surrounded
[08:38:56] <PattyCakes> https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-yacht-graceful-left-germany-amid-sanction-threats-report-2022-2

[08:39:17] <misspwn> PattyCakes, i tuned that out because they were not confirming it
[08:39:23] <monr0e> I knew it as soon as I heard Putin would entertain Macron. That's Putin's party piece, he'll happily waste your time whilst in the background he's preparing to do it anyway - only now you've wasted your time and you're unprepared

[08:41:47] <PattyCakes> I'm not saying WW3 is coming, or Cold war v2
[08:41:52] <PattyCakes> but, Vlad is getting ballsy
[08:42:00] <PattyCakes> and he'll be put into his place, eventually.
[08:42:03] <misspwn> nah, but it's it's deff a power move i hope to not see it play out in full
[08:42:34] <misspwn> texas doesn't need anymore ideas
[08:42:46] <PattyCakes> honestly, it'd be interesting to see if Vlad's nukes actually fire
[08:43:04] <PattyCakes> I mean interesting for the 3 minutes before human extinction 
[08:43:12] <misspwn> if you take out that part
[08:43:31] <misspwn> do you think other countries would involve themselves?
[08:43:56] <monr0e> It's already been very explicitly agreed that no part of any war over the Ukraine issue will not include the possibility of nuclear war

[08:44:55] <monr0e> The verbiage of that statement, which was a combined statement also including other countries, was a marked departure from Russia's usual official statements. I believe it.
[08:45:14] <Molnija> Oh god, we're about to be nuc'd
[08:45:15] <PattyCakes> Cause Vlad is known for his usual statements.
[08:45:50] <monr0e> Russia's usual statements are filled with multiple possible interpretations. This was not.
[08:46:43] <monr0e> One could argue that we might easily have also deployed trident to the area - but again, we have assured the world that we will not, by effective reasoning.

[08:47:44] <PattyCakes> monr0e, the only thing I can find of their official position was "we are monitoring"

[08:48:39] <monr0e> PattyCakes: China? Yeah I could be wrong. It's been information overload on this for a little while

[08:53:48] <misspwn> monr0e, who initiates those drills?
[08:54:39] <monr0e> misspwn: IIRC, in the UK local authorities did so under the direction fo the government. The government also released a number of practises that would occur int he event of nuclear strike. I can't comment on the US
[08:54:54] <misspwn> oh
[08:55:06] <misspwn> I was thinking this was just another drill they do in school
[08:55:16] <monr0e> Schools are a major part of the effort

[09:25:23] <sd> 05<V​irtual-Potato> just give me your full name, address, social security number, and a high resolution picture of your face, and I'll take care of it for you

[09:27:59] <DrGibby> CableNinja: any retirement account (401k, pension, otherwise) like a bank account, is required to give you statements 
[09:28:17] <CableNinja> DrGibby, I've moved a lot, etc. and never kept track of any of that shit
[09:28:35] <DrGibby> if you contributed to those accounts, they should come up on a credit report 
[09:29:22] <CableNinja> likely all of them havent been contributed to in years
[09:29:52] <DrGibby> generally you have to opt-in on contributions. If you *ever* did, those are lines that will show up

[18:29:38] <misspwn> no it's the dock, it's having USB issues
[18:29:56] <misspwn> so i'll be typing and then my monitors disconnect or the keyboard starts ghosting itself and repeating keys

[18:30:24] <arlion> lol
[18:30:50] <misspwn> my ducky was like 6 years old so i figured well maybe it really is just dying

[18:31:19] <arlion> one those quick swippy swappy switch boards
[18:31:30] <misspwn> yeah they can be. it had started with a couple keys and then it was random which keys would repeat keys even if you weren't typing

[18:35:01] <arlion> i'm fixing one of these servers. I almost made cisco RMA this switch last week. Turns out 1 server's SFP was bad, it just turns out the switch was reporting the error and the bad server wasn't
[18:35:43] <arlion> We had a data center power outage a month ago, so we are still fixing random shit in that DC
[18:36:22] <arlion> and this rack was absolutely effected. so it wasn't that far fetched that the switch just died or damaged

[18:43:44] <teh_f4ll3n> the SMTP is not in use, as far as I can tell
[18:44:29] <teh_f4ll3n> also, why not set it up in the current IIS? why install an old version? 
[18:44:53] <teh_f4ll3n> SirSceptalot, at least I have the local admin password now
[18:44:58] <CptLuxx> because it only exists in the old 6?
[18:45:35] <SirSceptalot> well that's an improvement
[18:47:09] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, I'll give you this one, I guess :D
[18:47:43] <teh_f4ll3n> still, no role listed, so I don't even know how it was set up

[18:48:12] <CptLuxx> v6 management console or something like that
[18:48:59] <teh_f4ll3n> you can add SMTP in server roles and features iirc

[18:56:29] <Hunterkll> only time i've ever used the built in SMTP is for sharepoint.....
[18:56:57] <CptLuxx> works fine for basic smtp relays
[18:56:59] <CptLuxx> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:57:28] <Hunterkll> i'm sure it does, but never really had a reason to use it
[18:57:38] <Hunterkll> either a barracuda type appliance and/or exchange system for most work
[18:57:50] <Hunterkll> but sharepoint needs the smtp service to process incoming/outgoing files and shit
[18:58:26] <mrghostman> we use it to relay scanned docs from copiers and whatnot to O365

[19:08:19] <estranger> what the heck is an interactive login with mtls 
[19:08:53] <estranger> typing in your cert chain by hand? =)
[19:09:16] <teh_f4ll3n> OAuth 2.0 type thing? like with outlook when you're asked to log into your email acc? :D

[19:09:51] <teh_f4ll3n> manually decrypting TLS packets
[19:10:03] <estranger> this is just a weird question
[19:10:15] <estranger> "we are using mtls and want to audit interactive vs non-interactive logins"
[19:10:29] <Hunterkll> interactive is like, console login 
[19:10:34] <Hunterkll> non-interactive is like, service account type shit
[19:10:55] <teh_f4ll3n> hmmm... 
[19:11:04] <Hunterkll> at least, in terms of windows logins/accounts 
[19:11:13] <teh_f4ll3n> mtls is I assume mutual tls
[19:11:18] <Hunterkll> yea
[19:11:21] <estranger> yup
[19:11:36] <estranger> Hunterkll, yeah there is no typing any logins w/ mtls ... you just pass a cert and the magic happens
[19:11:41] <Hunterkll> right
[19:11:47] <Hunterkll> it's still a login type
[19:11:49] <teh_f4ll3n> so they might have separate tls cert settings for interactive and non-interactive
[19:12:08] <Hunterkll> non-interactive would be say, server A auths to an applicaiton on server B to automatically hand data over or something
[19:12:17] <Hunterkll> interactive would be a user logging in via web browser to a web ap or whatever
[19:12:52] <estranger> with our mTLS you pass your user cert... and a principal is extracted from the DN and that gets used for authz/n ... nothing is interactive from how I would define it
[19:12:54] <Hunterkll> great example of this is SCOM gateways..... they use cert auth in both directions to authenticate from untrusted domains to relay agent data from the untrusted domain, that'd be non-interactive

[19:14:21] <teh_f4ll3n> interactive is when you manually inject ksql data via console :)
[19:14:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:14:38] <estranger> teh_f4ll3n, even then you need to pass your cert to even get into it  :P
[19:15:01] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, but the login itself is interactive
[19:15:12] <Hunterkll> so.... think of it like a standard desktop.... services running in the background are non-interactive logins, but your desktop workspace/session is classed as interactive

[19:24:10] <estranger> control center logins are interactive but doesnt use mtls

[19:25:13] <estranger> i need more info from the customer
[19:25:16] <Hunterkll> like all my service accounts are denied interactive login rights, so you can't log in as the accounts, and vice versa admin accounts can't be used for non-interactive login (so you can't have admins setting services up using their accounts lol)

[20:11:51] <A-KO> you either have to wait or complete a migration batch :P either/or
[20:12:12] <zerocool> hmm, lets see. also i might add that i thought i was smart and used what i understand about powershell jobs... and did a remove-moverequest which according to everything is only for canceling moverequests :(
[20:12:18] <zerocool> so that's part 2 of my problem
[20:12:24] <A-KO> yes
[20:12:27] <A-KO> that's a part of your problem
[20:12:30] <zerocool> which mailbox is being used, the one in db01 or db02
[20:12:33] <A-KO> it might actually be rolling back
[20:12:35] <int0x1C8> default behavior is that moverequests/migrationbatch complete on their own, you have to specify it if you want to complete manually

[20:16:03] <zerocool> i did see get-moverequest status was "complete" so, assuming the remove-* would not be bad.
[20:16:20] <zerocool> third question. why does the mailbox now exist in both old and new databases?
[20:16:35] <zerocool> am i support to explicitely remove the mailbox from the old database?

[20:25:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> if the move completed successfully thats it you should have nothing to do
[20:26:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> the more request / migration batch will be marked as complete and it can stay forever...

[22:38:29] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> right but with two internet lines, where should that monitoring solution be placed?
[22:38:34] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> you know?
[22:38:56] <int0x1C8> ideally it would be on the DNS server itself, but that's probably not possible
