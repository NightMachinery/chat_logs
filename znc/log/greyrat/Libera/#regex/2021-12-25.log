[06:03:39] <MaxE> Hi.
[06:05:05] <MaxE> How can I paste JS code here?
[06:05:24] <Me-me> You can use regex101 or pastebin or any other external service you like.
[06:05:37] <Me-me> Just don't paste it directly into chat, that'll trip the spam filtering bot.
[06:08:45] <MaxE> Yeah! Thank you for the reply. That is why I asked about it.
[06:08:46] <MaxE> https://pastebin.com/vse2mbXZ
[06:09:21] <MaxE> Hope I explained it well there.
[06:09:55] <Me-me> I don't know what you mean by "add here numbers".
[06:11:14] <MaxE> I use it for renaming batch files. So I need to add the end of the files incrementally numbers.
[06:16:16] <MaxE> No chance to do it?
[06:17:37] <Me-me> Sorry, I'm distracted. I still don't know what you mean, I think there's a bit of a language barrier. You want n3 to have a number added to the end?
[06:18:56] <MaxE> Yes, you correctly understood me.
[06:19:08] <Me-me> That doesn't sound like a regex thing.
[06:19:21] <Me-me> That is, regex doesn't do calculations or anything.
[06:22:01] <MaxE> It's possible to do it by using Advanced Renamer. Thought I can get help on how to do it here.
[06:22:47] <MaxE> I will use that code in Advanced Renamer.
[06:24:45] <Me-me> We can do the regex patterns here, but not the code.
[06:25:01] <Me-me> I mean some people will do the code anyway, but it's not what the room is about.
[06:27:30] <MaxE> OK, I got it. Thank you for the replies. Have a nice day.

[17:12:47] <re101-sheep-77> Hello everyone, please help with this regex https://regex101.com/r/iwwmYe/1 . It's capturing TLDs, but I've read the requirements for TLDs and it says "A TLD label MUST be at least two characters long and MAY be as long as 63 characters - not counting any leading or trailing periods (.). It MUST consist of only ASCII characters from the groups
[17:12:48] <re101-sheep-77> "letters" (A-Z), "digits" (0-9) and "hyphen" (-), and it MUST start with an ASCII "letter", and it MUST NOT end with a "hyphen". Upper and lower case MAY be mixed at random, since DNS lookups are case-insensitive." So, the thing is that I can't figure out (as I only started learning regex a week ago) how to capture only those TLDs that start with
[17:12:48] <re101-sheep-77> the letter and do NOT end with hyphen.
[17:14:36] <koollman> you probably don't want only regex to capture that :)
[17:16:05] <koollman> re101-sheep-77: [a-z]morestuffhere , would match things starting with a letter.  somestuffhere[a-z0-9]  would match things ending with letters or digits
[17:19:38] <koollman> \.[a-z][-a-z0-9]+[a-z0-9] might be something close to what you want
[17:20:54] <re101-sheep-77> Ok, will try that, thank you. I would gladly use something less cryptic than regex but I am required to use only regex (because it's a university task)

[20:46:48] <re101-adelie-12> sed(?<= i love it )Â  againstÂ  i love it sed sed i love it sed
[20:47:05] <re101-adelie-12> why is it not matching the fist and last sed
[20:48:44] <JohnDoe2> re101-adelie-12 sed doesn't know about positive lookbehinds
[20:48:55] <re101-adelie-12> right...
[20:49:10] <re101-adelie-12> but that.. still i love it :-)
[20:49:13] <JohnDoe2> if you want to keep it CLI you could try perl for example
[20:50:06] <JohnDoe2> re101-adelie-12 also, what you're asking regex to do is match "sed" and then assert that at the point after "d" in the string if you look back you will fine " i love it "
[20:50:08] <JohnDoe2> it will never work
[20:51:33] <re101-adelie-12> lets do it for grep.. so people don't get misguided --
[20:51:34] <re101-adelie-12> https://regex101.com/r/UWSDAy/1
[20:51:57] <re101-adelie-12> grep(?<= i love it ) againstÂ  i love it grep grep i love it grep
[20:53:00] <re101-adelie-12> JohnDoe2 - i see it now
[21:05:33] <JohnDoe2> re101-adelie-12 grep with -P is like perl 
[21:05:49] <re101-adelie-12> cool.. to know
[21:06:04] <JohnDoe2> otherwise grep is kinda like sed - it doesn't support advanced stuff like lookbehinds

[21:07:40] <JohnDoe2> re101-adelie-12 so the whole lookbehind stuff is meant to be before the point where you start matching. So the end of the lookbehind is the position of the "regex cursor", assuming the lookbehind returned true. So https://regex101.com/r/cLHyOk/2
[21:08:20] <JohnDoe2> you can see more in the debugger https://regex101.com/r/cLHyOk/2/debugger (but it requires pcre flavor to be selected)

[22:16:27] <purplex> re101-adelie-12: when you are looking behind, you need to look for " i love it sed" to get a match that way but you're looking for " i love it ".
[22:18:55] <purplex> that means when you match 'sed', the "regex cursor" is at the end of word 'sed'.. hope that helps

[23:24:05] <qswz> ^[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[012])-(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])$
[23:25:21] <qswz> so next level would be months at 30 vs 31
[23:25:27] <qswz> and february
[23:38:41] <re101-adelie-12> what wrong with this regex - https://regex101.com/r/ZHAmsW/1 - i took it from https://www.regular-expressions.info/completelines.html
[23:41:04] <re101-adelie-12> sorry there is a space at begining of regex
[23:41:11] <re101-adelie-12> removed it and it worked
[23:42:16] <purplex> yea it was the space
[23:42:53] <purplex> ^ will never assert 
[23:44:12] <purplex> qswz: its possible with a longer regex to validate it entirely, it should be around somewhere (i mean someone possibly already written it)
[23:45:25] <re101-adelie-12> validate what.. the regex itself
[23:46:09] <purplex> date format
