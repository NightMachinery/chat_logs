[00:31:45] <pulse> so how sane or insane is this https://github.com/pulzed/Orcus2D/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt
[00:32:04] <pulse> i cloned most of it from another foss project
[00:32:20] <pulse> then i just have this https://github.com/pulzed/Orcus2D/blob/main/build.sh
[00:34:24] <pulse> it does work, although it seems fairly finnicky
[00:34:45] <pulse> i can't make the binary be output into build/Release/bin for some reason
[00:34:51] <cbreak> pulse: I'm not a fan of GLOB
[00:34:59] <pulse> it wants to go into build/Release/Release or build/Debug/Debug
[00:35:10] <pulse> isn't glob what everyone uses
[00:35:49] <cbreak> doesn't look too bad though
[00:35:55] <cbreak> installing I always found annoying
[00:35:59] <cbreak> and bundling too...
[00:36:14] <cbreak> pulse: I list the files manually...
[00:36:20] <cbreak> it's... not maintenance free :/
[00:36:23] <pulse> sounds painful
[00:36:35] <pulse> i'm expecting this project to have a ton of sourcefiles
[00:36:46] <pulse> don't want to edit the list every time i add one
[00:38:00] <pulse> i really don't understand something
[00:38:05] <pulse> set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/$<CONFIGURATION>)
[00:38:09] <pulse> this line makes it output into Release
[00:38:14] <pulse> so if i change it to: set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)
[00:38:17] <pulse> then it outputs into bin, all good
[00:38:22] <pulse> but if i use my build.sh to do it
[00:38:31] <pulse> then it doesn't work
[00:38:46] <pulse> or, apparently now it does work
[00:38:51] <pulse> i'm so confused
[00:39:45] <pulse> actually, no it doesn't
[00:40:12] <pulse> it says /usr/bin/strip/: 'Release/Orcus2D': No such file
[00:40:57] <cbreak> I usually cd into the build dir
[00:41:04] <cbreak> then cmake .. from there
[00:41:24] <pulse> yeah but -B makes the dirs automatically
[00:42:50] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[00:44:20] <TinoDidriksen> Changing the output folder is such a weird old fashioned thing to do. Just have the build system output to its default place. That'll work better with other build system recipes and install.
[00:45:08] <pulse> what is this default place
[00:45:44] <TinoDidriksen> Depends on the platform. Usually the equivalent build folder of the CMakeLists.txt.
[00:46:18] <TinoDidriksen> But you don't need to care, because you can just ask the build system where the binary is.

[00:47:09] <pulse> what the hell does this do add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} POST_BUILD COMMAND ${CMAKE_STRIP} ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}/${PROJECT_NAME})
[00:47:52] <TinoDidriksen> That's not necessary. "make install" and packagers will strip if that's what the platform expects.
[00:48:42] <pulse> i see
[00:50:16] *** Quits: LangerJan (~jan@user/langerjan) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:52:05] <TinoDidriksen> Changing CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX from inside CMake is also very bad.
[00:53:47] <TinoDidriksen> And setting it to the binary output dir is just wrong. The install folder is NOT the build output folder.
[00:54:15] <TinoDidriksen> First things are built, then they are installed to a separate location and this install step strips if needed.
[00:54:39] <TinoDidriksen> Source != build != install
[00:56:02] <pulse> should i just remove everything from line 28 onward?
[00:56:16] <pulse> cause i have honestly no idea wtf the author was doing there
[00:56:21] <pulse> ok i understand binary stripping at least
[00:56:27] <pulse> it makes the release slightly smaller
[00:56:40] <pulse> but that INSTALL stuff i have no idea wtf the purpose is for that
[00:56:45] <johnny> it is kinda good tok now what is actually being stripped tho..
[00:57:20] <pulse> presumably unnecessary symbols?
[00:57:50] <TinoDidriksen> The INSTALL instructions are for making a macOS bundle and a Linux AppImage, which is generally fine to do, but not quite with the way the paths are set up there.
[00:58:03] <johnny> well you might build with debug and not want to strip those
[00:58:15] <pulse> i don't even really need to worry with install for now, i just want a build env so i can finally start writing code, lol
[00:58:22] <pulse> and it builds now at least
[00:58:31] <pulse> johnny, yes, there's an if
[00:58:35] <pulse> if (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL Release)
[00:58:38] <pulse> i expect this works
[00:58:49] <TinoDidriksen> Changing *_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is wrong, I'd say.
[00:58:51] <johnny> i just went with meson every time so i dont' have to think about this
[00:59:00] <johnny> cmake is a bit annoying
[00:59:09] <johnny> although i still have cmake projects to deal with tho :(
[00:59:20] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, idk though, i kinda like it how i set it up now
[00:59:36] <pulse> i run ./build.sh and it outputs the binary into /build/Release/bin
[00:59:43] <TinoDidriksen> Yeah, that's wrong imo.
[00:59:44] <johnny> but i don't recall every touching those vars TinoDidriksen is talking about
[00:59:47] <pulse> and if i run ./build.sh debug it outputs it into /build/Debug/bin
[01:00:02] <johnny> why not let cmake and ninja/make do the work
[01:00:35] <TinoDidriksen> The binary should wind up in build/src
[01:00:37] <johnny> although i guess a script can set the correct v araibles so you'd still call the shell script
[01:00:43] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, i don't get why though. aren't you supposed to setup the build env to your preference
[01:00:44] <TinoDidriksen> Well, in your case just in build/
[01:00:55] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, yeah but then you can't differentiate debug/release
[01:01:03] <johnny> TinoDidriksen, do you think it's not valid to have build/{Debug,Release} dirs?
[01:01:08] <TinoDidriksen> You can, by having a build folder for each.
[01:01:11] <hnOsmium0001[m]> > if (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL Release)
[01:01:11] <hnOsmium0001[m]> regarding that specifically, it's recommened you use generator expressions $<$<CONFIG:Release>:"some string you want to use if Release">
[01:01:25] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, i do have a build folder for each though. /build/Release/ and /build/Debug/ :D
[01:01:28] <hnOsmium0001[m]> $<$<CONFIG:Release>:"some string">
[01:01:41] <pulse> hnOsmium0001[m], ugh, i have no idea what that is
[01:01:50] <TinoDidriksen> Yes, but CMake should not create those.
[01:02:01] <pulse> why not
[01:02:01] <hnOsmium0001[m]> I know it looks horrendous, it's so that if can work properly with "multi target generators" such as VS sln files, where you can alter the Debug vs Release within the generator
[01:02:15] <pulse> yeah i don't want to do that at all
[01:02:18] <pulse> i know you'll cringe but
[01:02:25] <pulse> i want cmake to work on linux and potentially mac
[01:02:29] <pulse> for windows i'll have a custom .sln thing
[01:02:37] <TinoDidriksen> CMake works fine on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
[01:02:38] <hnOsmium0001[m]> side note, I hate matrix autoformat
[01:02:42] <pulse> because i don't want to generate some generic solution
[01:02:48] <hnOsmium0001[m]> it's eating the < and > in every message I'm trying to send
[01:02:49] <pulse> i want a very hand-tuned project
[01:03:26] *** Quits: pah (~pah@user/pah) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:03:33] <hnOsmium0001[m]> pulse: if that's what you want to do, sure, though I would recommend adding a comment noting it won't work VS by design
[01:03:35] <TinoDidriksen> If your CMakeLists.txt uses ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} in a command or path, I would consider that a serious problem.
[01:03:53] <pulse> hnOsmium0001[m], i think most foss projects include both cmake and a custom hand-tuned vsproj/sln
[01:03:59] <hnOsmium0001[m]> also note: Xcode projects are also considered multitarget
[01:04:08] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, what is that
[01:04:13] <TinoDidriksen> There is no reason to make a VS solution when you have CMake.
[01:04:17] <hnOsmium0001[m]> though I don't see Xcode generators being that often (read: never)
[01:04:28] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, but it outputs a very generic project file where i want a super hand-tuned one
[01:05:06] <pulse> and i can probably make it work with both anyway
[01:05:08] <TinoDidriksen> In your https://github.com/pulzed/Orcus2D/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt I would erase line 4, 7, 8, 28+
[01:05:18] <TinoDidriksen> Hand-tuned for what?
[01:05:39] <TinoDidriksen> CMake can give you the same tuning, but in a portable manner.
[01:05:49] <pulse> VS is by definition not portable though
[01:06:07] <pulse> idk, i'll consider it. tnx for suggestions
[01:06:09] <TinoDidriksen> So I repeat: Hand-tuned for what?
[01:06:17] <pulse> for development of course
[01:06:18] <hnOsmium0001[m]> I'm pretty sure MSBuild runs on linux now /me runs
[01:06:24] <johnny> i was just gonna say that
[01:06:29] <johnny> not that i've ever used it ho
[01:06:33] <johnny> tho*
[01:07:14] <hnOsmium0001[m]> jokes aside, I think the linux version only works with SDK based .csproj's not .vcxproj
[01:07:16] *** Joins: Shanzem (~Shanzem@86.31.109.147)
[01:07:38] <cbreak> pulse: try to keep your cmake lists file free of custom junk
[01:07:42] <cbreak> that'll make development easier
[01:07:52] <pulse> yeah, i'll try to trim it down to minimal working version
[01:07:57] <pulse> then i'll expand if i need to
[01:08:00] <TinoDidriksen> I can't quite imagine how a VS solution could be hand-tuned in a way CMake can't. You must be talking about IDE options such as window layout, which aren't part of the build.
[01:08:09] <pulse> i'll try TinoDidriksen's suggestion too, to see if that satisfies my needs
[01:08:17] <pulse> although i don't see how it makes sense to output both release and debug into the same dir
[01:08:18] <cbreak> what I  usually add are targets, some warning flags, setting the c++ standard, finding packages for deps, and linking them
[01:08:26] <TinoDidriksen> Don't output both into the same folder.
[01:08:35] <pulse> TinoDidriksen, i'm pretty sure cmake can't fine-tune the ENTIRE project settings of VS
[01:08:46] <pulse> there's quite a lot of custom things you can fine-tune to your specific needs
[01:08:51] <pulse> and i have a way of configuring VS to my liking
[01:08:58] <pulse> the last thing i want is some generic project file
[01:09:05] <pulse> but idk, i'll have to play around with it until i'm sure about it
[01:09:15] <pulse> i'll try your suggestions and see if that works for me. tnx
[01:09:18] <cbreak> pulse: cmake either creates a build environment for only debug or only release (you can switch of course), or it uses a multi-target generator like xcode, which puts it into different dirs
[01:09:34] <pulse> cbreak, i see, so this is kind of an antipattern
[01:09:39] <pulse> (it works, though!)
[01:09:52] <TinoDidriksen> Absolutely have a folder per build type where applicable, but CMake shouldn't know about this because it doesn't need to. It just needs to know what the current folder is a given type.
[01:10:28] <cbreak> you can always switch between debug / release if you want to.
[01:10:32] <cbreak> that's probably fine for development
[01:10:41] <cbreak> and you can have different build dirs for deployment

[15:43:28] <PJBoy> argh so loud
[15:44:14] <LordKalma> PJBoy, during the implementation of QString::isLower() https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qstring.html#isLower there were apparently lengthy discussions whether isLower() is everything is lower or none is upper :D
[15:44:43] <PJBoy> that's actually an interesting question

[15:45:17] <LordKalma> indeed
[15:45:21] <PJBoy> there's a question about characters with multiple lower case symbols too
[15:45:35] <PJBoy> like our good friend greek letter sigma
[15:45:51] <LordKalma> you don't have to go far... isLower("0123") ?
[15:46:31] <PJBoy> oh isLower, not toLower
[15:46:39] <PJBoy> hmm
[15:46:39] <LordKalma> yes
[15:46:44] <LordKalma> toLower() was another pain, apparently
[15:46:59] <PJBoy> yeah I would define `isLower(s)` as `s == toLower(s)`
[15:47:16] <PJBoy> I think that would be a reasonable property
[15:47:32] <LordKalma> that doesn't cover the edge case you just mentioned
[15:47:43] <PJBoy> oh yeah that's trash in unicode
[15:47:52] <PJBoy> maybe I would just not provide those functions
[15:47:55] <PJBoy> hmm
[15:48:07] <PJBoy> idk what does unicode consortium think about this?
[15:48:17] <PJBoy> surely this is a somewhat solved problem
[15:48:51] <PJBoy> full respect to the Qt docs having a dark theme btw
[15:49:39] <LordKalma> PJBoy, actually according to the docs, your implementation is the one used
[15:49:42] <LordKalma> "Returns true if the string is lowercase, that is, it's identical to its toLower() folding."
[15:49:45] <PJBoy> yeah I just saw that

[15:56:33] <PJBoy> can I somehow point to this local directory as a dependency in my main project's conanfile.txt?
[15:57:07] <PJBoy> I'd expect so, but nothing's jumping out at me in the docs
[15:57:59] <LordKalma> nope
[15:58:07] <LordKalma> there is no support for in-repo conanfile.py's
[15:58:11] <ville> LordKalma: some macros that declare the kinds of operations i want. NN_DEFAULT_COPYMOVE(), NN_DEFAULT_MOVEONLY(), NN_DELETE_COPYMOVE()...
[15:58:11] <LordKalma> it was a design decision
[15:58:32] <PJBoy> hm
[15:58:32] <LordKalma> you need that recipe in your artifactory or nothing
[15:58:49] <LordKalma> I've queried about it and there was some arguments in favor of this
[15:58:51] <LordKalma> I don't remember
[15:58:54] <PJBoy> can I use `conan create` on that dependency to build into my local cache?
[15:59:00] <LordKalma> yes
[15:59:03] <PJBoy> and then have the conanfile.txt pick that up?
[15:59:08] <LordKalma> I think so
[15:59:16] <PJBoy> ok that's perfectly acceptable
[15:59:31] * PJBoy gives it a whirl
[15:59:34] <LordKalma> but that's an "I think so", don't recall right now exactly
[16:00:01] <LordKalma> anyway, there was a fork of conan, called barbarian, which is pretty much this, it's a "serverless" conan, it picks up conanfile.py's from repos directly
[16:00:40] <PJBoy> including a locally modified version of that repo?
[16:00:45] <LordKalma> but since people hate naming their projects something actually findable on a search engine I can't link it to you
[16:00:48] <LordKalma> no idea, never tried it

[18:04:48] <rpav> Alipha: i definitely find that intermediates improve future maintenance to a point, make debugging etc easier, but
[18:05:06] <rpav> LordKalma: yeah that's my 2nd of 3 major problems with an otherwise-fine language
[18:05:17] <PJBoy> lua's global by default thing is worse IMO
[18:05:20] <rpav> it is
[18:05:40] <rpav> they're both error-prone but the global default thing is the worst
[18:06:40] <LordKalma> making intermediate steps helps until there are so many you end up having to make a mental stack for all the functions you have to scroll to and read
[18:06:54] <rpav> base-1 arrays are a close second because they add a lot of weird shift terms and it's not self-evident when things are correct .. it probably would be if you thought entirely in base-1-array, but who would want to do that

[21:13:05] <ville> given that there also exists: SDL_PIXELFORMAT_XBGR8888. what do you think the pixel width is in bytes for both?
[21:13:28] <rpav> yeah this should really be integrated to make cpp.php really easy to use, so everyone who wants to do this can without a lot of resistance
[21:13:42] <PJBoy> I would guess 3 bytes for the first, and 4 for the second
[21:13:42] <rpav> and thus everything they do can be easily hard-passed on without a complicated filter
[21:14:03] <PJBoy> although with some doubt about the first because of the possibility of 32-bit alignment
[21:14:18] <rpav> please make sure to use this for all your things and post such projects publicly to github
[21:14:23] <ville> PJBoy: you'd think but apprently both are 32

[21:14:57] <PJBoy> kinda fair though, but still :(
[21:15:11] <ville> no it's not fair. it's fucking nuts.

[21:15:30] <rpav> ^
[21:15:42] <rpav> it's not nuts, it's just the format only specifies meaningful data in 24 of 32 bits
[21:15:48] <rpav> if you want packed 24-bit color that's something else
[21:16:01] <ville> that's what one would expcet from the XBGR8888
[21:16:16] <PJBoy> that's true
[21:16:18] <txtsd> Ok it works with 1/0, but not with ON/OFF
[21:16:33] <txtsd> Not sure how I'm supposed to compare ON/OFF in C++

[21:16:59] <txtsd> target_compile_definitions(${Launcher_Name} PRIVATE ${Launcher_APP_BINARY_DEFS})
[21:17:29] <txtsd> latter contains the -D flag mentioned above
[21:17:40] <rpav> probably one of the horrific generator expressions will do this
[21:17:58] <rpav> but yeah you should otherwise pass them manually and not just blob in cmake things
[21:18:14] <txtsd> Not my choice. I'm editing existing code.
[21:18:34] <rpav> ah fixing code
[21:24:22] <rpav> probably the sane way to do it is still `if(THING_DEF) target_compile_definitions(tgt PUBLIC WITH_THING=1) endif()`
[21:25:06] <rpav> actually you could probably write a function that takes a list of strings that are definitions, and uses $<BOOL:v> or whatever to produce a new list of strings with proper values

[22:25:55] <pulse> hmm, i just built a different project and it worked fine there

[22:28:43] <rpav> where's the tif_config.h part
[22:28:56] <rpav> ah right github does t
[22:31:57] <rpav> hmm, it outputs to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR .. maybe that's not added to target_include_directories

[23:17:58] <pulse> i gotta ask though
[23:18:05] <pulse> why does wxwidgets build in like 1 minute on windows/VS
[23:18:13] <pulse> but it takes 5-10 times that on linux
[23:18:16] <pulse> even on hardware
[23:18:25] <rpav> how are you building on linux
[23:18:43] <pulse> cmake and make
[23:19:04] <rpav> probably not using `make -jN` .. really, use ninja, it was built for cmake
[23:19:16] <rpav> you don't have to figure out your -j or anythng (though you can specify it if you want)
[23:19:32] <LordKalma> ninja is generously faster than make

[23:19:51] <LordKalma> but wxwidgets ships sln's for windows, so who knows what's different
[23:20:06] <pulse> it builds a lot faster on windows *shrug*
[23:20:17] <pulse> doesn't really matter once it's built
[23:20:37] <rpav> ninja has a lot less lag at least .. i'm not sure how much it really improves build times but it's the difference between `ninja && ./run` being nearly instant if there's no work, and `make && ./run` being laggy
[23:20:58] <rpav> pulse: it builds faster on windows because msbuild by default runs in parallel, and make by default does not
[23:21:01] <rpav> but ninja _does_
[23:21:06] <pulse> ah
[23:21:08] <pulse> that would make sense, yeah
[23:21:33] <rpav> ninja is also a bit less overhead in some things though i think it's still probably not generous enough with its -j
[23:21:51] <LordKalma> pulse, you used cmake on windows?
[23:21:56] <pulse> LordKalma, yes
[23:22:04] <pulse> only to generate sln
[23:22:09] <pulse> then i build from vs
[23:22:09] <LordKalma> wxwidgets ships visual studio solutions, and that's the recommended solution, iirc
[23:22:18] <LordKalma> you could have used the sln's directly, then
[23:22:23] <LordKalma> and you didn't use ninja
[23:22:25] <pulse> that was my original plan
[23:22:34] <pulse> but cmake seems slightly less problematic now that it works
[23:23:47] <rpav> cmake - "don't be fooled by the documentation, it actually works and is fairly simple"
[23:24:05] <pulse> oh yeah the cmake docs are apparently the work of the devil itself
[23:24:16] <rpav> though VS is a monkey in the wrench ;/ especially if you generate SLN and want to start generating folders and stuff, which cmake will absolutely _do_, but it's a few extra things
[23:24:31] <rpav> they're pretty good reference docs, and absolutely terrible tutorial docs
[23:24:32] <pulse> well, originally i wanted a custom hand-tuned sln
[23:24:35] <pulse> like i'm used to doing
[23:24:38] <rpav> though! there is that new cmake tutorial that looked ok
[23:24:59] <pulse> this seems less of a hassle though
[23:25:08] <rpav> yeah porting that though is a pita, as is maintaining separate build systems if you want to work in linux
[23:25:09] <LordKalma> cmake docs are fine if you already know cmake (language)
[23:25:14] <pulse> i just want to build as fast as possible on any machine
[23:25:14] <LordKalma> it's reference documentation
[23:25:20] <rpav> ninja
[23:26:33] <rpav> https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2015-January/006178.html <- ninja being a bit faster than msbuild for lldb in 2015, though, it's been a few years since then so who knows
[23:27:00] <LordKalma> people say qt 6 builds quite faster now with cmake+ninja
[23:31:14] <pulse> i hope this is somewhat sane now https://github.com/pulzed/KiwiEd/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt
[23:31:54] <LordKalma> add_definitions(/MP) # no no no no
[23:32:00] <rpav> heh
[23:32:10] <LordKalma> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_compile_options.html
[23:32:18] <LordKalma> eg.: add_compile_options(/W4 /WX)
[23:32:23] <pulse> i coped that from another proj
[23:32:33] <rpav> not the best but if it's not a library not a huge deal
[23:32:49] <pulse> it's a desktop app
[23:33:05] <pulse> yeah maybe i should add those warning flags
[23:33:05] <rpav> yeah .. at some point if you have multiple targets, target-specific flags can be necessary/useful but
[23:33:20] <pulse> my main goal rn was to get the build functional, i can improve it over time
[23:33:22] <LordKalma> add_executable("${PROJECT_NAME}" is very much an anti-patterns
[23:33:27] <LordKalma> because you may want multiple targets
[23:33:37] <pulse> LordKalma, err
[23:33:39] <rpav> that used to be fairly prevalent too
[23:33:41] <LordKalma> in fact, if we were to be picky this isn't great cmake
[23:33:44] <LordKalma> but anyway
[23:33:46] <pulse> but that's where the WIN32 thing is
[23:33:48] <LordKalma> it works, whatever
[23:34:00] <LordKalma> pulse, just give it a decent name, not recycle ${PROJECT_NAME
[23:34:08] <LordKalma> that's what I meant
[23:34:09] <ville> LordKalma: nothing like future proofing the most simplest thing...

[23:34:16] <pulse> i just literally want project name lol
[23:34:17] <rpav> LordKalma: it's a start .. it's a lot closer than some i've seen
[23:34:28] <pulse> yeah, anyway, i might improve it over time
[23:34:34] <LordKalma> pulse, yes, and it's fine, just making general comments
[23:34:38] <pulse> rn i'm happy it works on all my VMs, my linuxbox, and my windows machines
[23:34:47] <pulse> LordKalma, yeah that's fine
[23:35:13] <pulse> idk what this does, either: set(LINUX ON CACHE INTERNAL "")

[23:35:17] <pulse> also copied from another proj
[23:35:22] <rpav> `add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ..)` is mostly useful if you want a CMakeLists.txt template that you can change the top a little and get the "right" target built
[23:35:31] <LordKalma> pulse, it does nothing
[23:35:35] <pulse> i see
[23:35:39] <LordKalma> it's just someone wanted a LINUX variable
[23:35:45] <rpav> but these days templates aren't that useful because you don't need like 500-line cmakelists.txt to get something built
[23:35:45] <LordKalma> to maybe use if(LINUX) later
[23:35:46] <pulse> ah
[23:35:53] <pulse> ok then i don't need that
[23:36:18] *** Quits: ghenry (~ghenry@ghenry.plus.com) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:36:27] <LordKalma> because, as you can see by the `if (UNIX AND NOT APPLE)` you don't have a quick way to do `if(LINUX)` on cmake
[23:36:34] <LordKalma> so that kind of snippet is common
[23:36:47] <pulse> also i expect you will cringe at this https://github.com/pulzed/KiwiEd/blob/main/build.sh
[23:36:55] <pulse> but *shrug* it works
[23:37:07] <LordKalma> it's fine, I don't care :p

[23:37:22] <rpav> pulse: you should see the ones i use heh
[23:37:31] <LordKalma> pulse, but that lone make in the bottom :(
[23:37:36] <LordKalma> give it a -j :D
[23:37:54] <rpav> maybe limit to -j8 or -j16 :P
[23:38:13] <LordKalma> ${nproc --all} or whatever the syntax on bash is :p
[23:38:15] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414)
[23:38:20] * rpav has a currently-213-line config script complete with usage and command-line option parsing
[23:38:32] <pulse> what is -j again
[23:38:37] <pulse> i faintly remember knowing something about it once
[23:38:40] <LordKalma> number of parallel jobs
[23:38:50] <LordKalma> you generally want more or less the same as processor cores
[23:39:14] <LordKalma> try with `make -j$(nproc)`
[23:39:36] <rpav> nproc --all maybe
[23:39:56] <LordKalma> return the same on my machine
[23:40:04] <rpav> hm, returns 1 and 16 on here
[23:40:14] <pulse> i added -j16
[23:40:17] <LordKalma> weird, returns 12 on both for me
[23:40:35] <LordKalma> rpav, do you have a xeon or something?
[23:40:37] <rpav> really you want like 2*cores, but i wouldn't go over ram-in-GB/2
[23:40:38] <pulse> returns 2 on my VM which is correct

[23:40:41] <rpav> LordKalma: threadripper
[23:40:46] <LordKalma> ah ok ok
[23:40:53] <LordKalma> yeah, makes sense then
[23:41:00] <LordKalma> threadripper is disguised Epyc
[23:41:07] <rpav> i don't know why it's weird ;/ this has actual cores .. who even uses multiple separate cpus anymore
[23:41:17] <LordKalma> Xeon users :p
[23:41:37] <rpav> right but xeon is still multicore and if you SMP it's max 4 isn't it?
[23:41:44] <LordKalma> pulse, -j16 on a 2 core VM won't really accelerate it :p
[23:41:53] <pulse> won't it default to -j2 ?
[23:42:00] <LordKalma>  no
[23:42:05] <pulse> well that's dumb
[23:42:09] <rpav> that's make ;/
[23:42:27] <LordKalma>  `make -j$(nproc)` `make -j$(nproc --all)`, or whatever is the best option, probably
[23:42:49] <pulse> ok i changed it to that
[23:42:51] <rpav> it will definitely not build as fast on a 2-core VM as native all-core
[23:42:57] <pulse> https://github.com/pulzed/KiwiEd/blob/main/build.sh
[23:43:05] <pulse> let me test it on my actual linuxbox to see if it's any faster now
[23:43:09] <pulse> because the other day i waited like 10 minutes
[23:43:15] <pulse> and it has 4 cores so
[23:43:21] <LordKalma> rpav, point is -j16 on a 2 core machine will not be better than maje (-j1)
[23:43:29] <rpav> LordKalma: yeah vastly worse hah
[23:43:30] <LordKalma> because like, it'll drown itself
[23:43:45] <rpav> it gets worse if you are ram bound too
[23:43:46] <LordKalma> pulse, yeah, make -j$(nproc) is fine
[23:44:15] <pulse> tnx for help btw, appreciated
[23:44:29] <pulse> now i just have to figure out if i want a different name for this project
[23:44:32] <pulse> can't really decide
[23:45:34] <LordKalma> rpav, threadripper is a single-socket platform, but they didn't make a very good job disguising it's just an epyc CPU with a less interesting IO controller and clocks cranked up haha
[23:46:35] <rpav> ah .. not even sure what epyc is
[23:46:43] <LordKalma> the server skew
[23:47:00] <rpav> oh, i was thinking their SoC thing but that must have been a different name
[23:47:33] <pulse> yeah it definitely builds faster now with -j
[23:48:23] <LordKalma> that's what it's for :p
