[01:11:21] <kline> indigo | I wonder if adding a random sleep to the password reset query can alleviate timing attacks
[01:12:27] <kline> no, because if you add a random sleep of 1-5 seconds, then an attacker can denoise by running a lot of attacks and see it skew 1-5 seconds for early exits and 1.1-5.1 seconds for long paths
[01:13:11] <technomancy> it can push it into the realm of infeasibility but it doesn't address the root cause
[01:13:24] <kline> this is the same as how they are dealing with "network jitter", aka, random length network induced latency as your packets traverse to the server

[02:37:46] <edk> although realistically even a pretty crap attempt at this technique is going to mess up the distribution so much that it'll take real time years to execute the attack
[02:37:56] <riv> it's better to use constant time algorithms, trying to sleep seems very fragile
[02:38:18] <kline> realistically, timing out should be a failure mode anyway
[02:38:34] <edk> riv: it *can* be done robustly but i broadly agree
[02:38:42] <edk> with the caveat that it's quite hard to design a constant-time algorithm
[02:38:47] <kline> if youre taking 5s and timing out on a login query then what you're leaking is that theres a way to trigger pathological behaviour in your query

[04:01:38] <kline> gwozniak, qemu by default is an emulator that will do all-software implementations of hardware, including non-native arches. with kvm it runs at near-native, replacing CPU emulation in software to actual hardware in virtualised mode

[06:55:36] <dimadima> just asking cause the app i'm working on for a long time is constantly making me sad with its boring design. and here i see this oss project that looks great
[06:56:21] <dimadima> got to get a user base and then ask them i guess
[06:56:42] <dimadima> or corporate backing :|
[06:57:34] <dimadima> what's the deal with corporations?

[07:45:18] <Irenes> yeah if social media doesn't work for you my next thought would be to look for discussion forums where artists hang out
[07:45:25] <Irenes> and whoever answers, ask to see their portfolio
[07:45:57] <Irenes> notionally a spammer could try to pass off someone's portfolio as their own, you'll have to take the time to talk to people and sort through it
[07:47:01] <Irenes> I don't mean to suggest this is easy, there's a reason that "art director" is a whole job in its own right
[07:47:50] <Irenes> you can also search around and try to find artists by their websites
[07:48:04] <Irenes> but they might decide your job isn't big enough to be worth their time

[08:05:18] <cb> and i dotn know how artists would take that kind of environment
[08:06:19] <cot> Depends. Artists which prefer to paint scenery won't take that kind of a commision, I suppose.
[08:06:36] <cot> But artists which do tilesets for games most likely would, and I've seen a lot of tilesets on r/PixelArt.
[08:06:51] <cot> Just curious, what kind of icons are those for?

[22:41:35] <thardin> no idea
[22:41:48] <dimadima> in america the last few generations basically just eat simple american food

[22:59:25] <shapr> good and bad points, like anything
[22:59:36] <dimadima> what were the bad points?
[23:00:05] <shapr> self employment means you do your own sales, accounting, etc
[23:00:09] <shapr> Sweden means high taxes
[23:00:26] <shapr> Europe means more vacation, but if you're self-employed that can mean you run out of money :-)

[23:01:34] <dimadima> were you legally allowed to be employed in sweden/finland?
[23:01:36] <gerikson> not so much if you're self-employed, or freelance, or an employer...
[23:01:59] <dimadima> hehe
[23:02:09] <shapr> oh yeah, I still have my permits
[23:02:09] <dimadima> "or an employer"
[23:02:32] <gerikson> also most of europe has a "precariat" of people working temp / short-term contracts etc
[23:02:32] <shapr> I also got Swedish immigration law changed
[23:02:34] <shapr> twice
[23:02:47] <shapr> that was a headache ... two headaches
[23:03:08] <dimadima> how'd you manage to do that?
[23:03:17] <gerikson> dimadima: I mean, compared to the US
[23:03:19] <shapr> I should write a blog post
[23:03:26] <dimadima> definitely...
[23:03:29] <shapr> in short, I was a legal resident of Finland
[23:03:36] <shapr> so that made me a scandinavian citizen
[23:03:37] <gerikson> I personally am salaried so I'm golden
[23:03:45] <gerikson> also working for a US-owned company ...
[23:03:49] <shapr> but I was a US citizen, so I was not allowed to move into Sweden without an existing permit
[23:03:54] <shapr> so I found a bug in their international law
[23:04:11] <gerikson> shapr: lol I watched a Y/T by a Yank in Sweden
[23:04:21] <shapr> scandinavian citizens are(were?) given all the same rights as swedish citizens
[23:04:31] <gerikson> he was invited to work but no-one had realized that you ust can't work in Sweden if you're form the US
[23:04:33] <shapr> also, I'd already rented an apartment and started my Swedish business
[23:04:44] <shapr> gerikson: oh, I'd like to see that
[23:05:04] <shapr> so migrationsverket got all frustrated and said my case was working its way through the court system
[23:05:08] <shapr> that took six or nine months
[23:05:17] <shapr> but I finally got a permit as "life partner of an EU citizen"

[23:05:50] <shapr> I think that was really for "you bought volvo, please come into our country"

[23:06:31] <gerikson> Sweden talks a lot about being welcome for immigrants politically, but it's really unpopular really, so the bureucracy takes the hit of denying people entry

[23:29:22] <cot> Do you have a GH/Linkdin/etc profile that we can look at to ensure that you're not a spammer?
[23:29:27] <cot> Twitter wouldn't be bad either
[23:29:33] <gerikson> Guest83: where can we find out more about you? "Guest83" is the ultimate generic
[23:30:11] <cot> gerikson: it was a slave state that stayed with the Union, and I believe lincoln did declare martial lhaw or something to ensure that they didn't seceded at some point
[23:30:14] <cot> gah lag
[23:30:15] <Guest83> Ha, of course. Here's my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilesh/
[23:30:54] <Guest83> gerikson: and here's my HN profile if that matters https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=putlake

[23:39:34] <gerikson> Guest83: no offence, but "serial entrepreneur" is a red flag for me ... what's your goal after becoming a member of lobste.rs
[23:39:37] <gerikson> ?
[23:41:40] <Guest83> gerikson: What is this, a job interview? I find interesting things on HN and often save them. I participate in conversation if I feel like there is something valuable to add. I don't have a big goal after becoming a member of lobsters. It's a forum. I think it will be interesting like HN.
[23:42:17] <gerikson> Guest83: fair enough

[23:42:58] <gerikson> you might know that an inviter is responsible for an invitee, and if they turn out to be spammers it doesn't look good...
[23:43:19] <cot> well, but inviters of spammers are very rarely banned unless they have an obvious connection to invited spammer
[23:43:31] <cot> e.g., they're coworkers or something
[23:43:34] <gerikson> I won't be extending an invite but others might
[23:43:43] <gerikson> cot: *I* feel bad
[23:43:59] <gerikson> I'm the reason new accounts have to wait 70 days to post an unknown domain
[23:44:00] <cot> Fair
[23:44:07] <cot> *gasp*
[23:44:10] <cot> bad gerikson!
[23:44:10] <gerikson> because I invited some fucking "growth hackers"
[23:44:17] <cot> jk, totally fair
[23:44:25] <shapr> :-(
[23:45:01] <Guest83> How do you prove a negative..like you're not a spammer
[23:45:25] <cot> There's no way to *prove* that you're not a spammer, but there are indications that you may or may not be
[23:45:42] <cot> But yeah, "entrepreneur" is something we've seen in a lot of spammers, sadly :/
[23:46:10] <cot> But stick around a bit, as we get to know you there's a good chance you'd get an invite
[23:46:15] <shapr> yeah, hang out and chat
[23:46:15] <Guest83> I've run a wiki for over a decade. If this is your way of being exclusive, fine. There are way better ways of preventing spam.
[23:46:31] <shapr> Guest83: oh, what are the better ways?
[23:46:45] * shapr wants to learn
[23:47:07] <Guest83> You could restrict new submissions until an account gets some karma points by participating in other ways
[23:47:17] <rwb> easily gamed
[23:47:28] <cot> Yeah, spammers will just cross-post HN stuff until they have enough karma, then spam.
[23:47:34] <cot> We've tried a lot of those things.
[23:47:44] <Guest83> You could assume positive intent until you see a pattern of abuse
[23:48:06] <rwb> or we could just invite people who stick around for a while and seem like a good fit for the site. :^)
[23:48:27] <Guest83> Or that, sure
[23:48:54] <shapr> Guest83: have you written any cool code recently?
[23:48:56] <Guest83> People aren't likely to stick around though if you just look at them and say I think you're a red flag and I think you may be a spammer
[23:48:58] <Guest83> That's just rude
[23:49:07] <shapr> can I show you some cool things I made lately? :-D

[23:50:58] <shapr> Guest83: hm, what if everyone does this?
[23:51:39] <Guest83> The effectiveness of the technique will reduce drastically because people will just be evicting each other's content from the cache
[23:52:00] <shapr> hm, that could be a problem

[23:53:16] <shapr> Guest83: is there a way to tell the CDN that certain pages are more important to you?
[23:53:25] <shapr> I'm trying to think of an approach that would be good for everyone
[23:53:29] <Guest83> For my site 200 pages are responsible for 90% of the traffic. So I only use this technique for 200 out of 1500 pages
[23:54:56] <Guest83> You do sort of tell the CDN how long you are OK with caching, although it's not about importance. A CDN assumes that frequently requested resources are more important.
[23:55:10] <Guest83> So I am assuming that their cache eviction is based on LRU
[23:55:38] <Guest83> i.e., every new request to a cached resource should renew its expiry date. Not sure if Fastly actually does that.
[23:57:32] <shapr> hm, I wonder if those details are available?
[23:58:29] *** kinduff4 is now known as kinduff
[23:58:47] <msmith12[m]> still waiting for mine
[23:59:20] <Guest83> shapr: If they were, the approach to increasing your cache hit rate would still be the same -- i.e., make requests that prime your cache
[23:59:36] <shapr> My reading group is doing minikanren next week, could anyone point me to useful things to read?
[23:59:49] <shapr> Guest83: does that cost you money?
