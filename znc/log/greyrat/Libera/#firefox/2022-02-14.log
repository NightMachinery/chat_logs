[00:03:13] <t4nk_freenode> you ppl are soooo off topic, it's diSGusting!!! therefor I'd like to add the following:

[00:03:59] <t4nk_freenode> and I'm completely stunned, and ask myself how on earth I could have watched it
[00:04:40] <t4nk_freenode> same goes for star trek too, if I'm honest
[00:05:24] <t4nk_freenode> tng is really horrible, if you look at it
[00:06:16] <t4nk_freenode> you can ama about it though, and I will know the answer :b

[00:16:43] <susi> horrible how?
[00:17:12] <susi> it poses interesting ethical questions, there's interesting philosophy and psychology
[00:19:55] <ede> at least there was no Gorn
[00:20:07] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[00:20:28] <susi> 'poses' may be wrong word but you know what i mean, there's insteresting problems presented in tng
[00:20:55] <susi> last 2 weeks i've been watching tng 24/7
[00:21:08] <t4nk_freenode> no, ede, but they come Darned close nearly all of the time
[00:21:51] <t4nk_freenode> like every alien species you meet... walks around in identical pyjamas
[00:22:17] <susi> so? it's not a problem
[00:22:37] <susi> and every bi-pedal would come up with something pretty close to each other
[00:22:54] <susi> but it's not relevant

[00:26:43] <t4nk_freenode> of the star trek franchise that is
[00:27:49] <susi> ede: you can't really prefer TOS over TNG, or you'd be lying
[00:28:02] <ede> some do
[00:28:13] <susi> they are posers then
[00:28:14] <mefistofeles> t4nk_freenode: depends on what you are judging, production, story-telling, acting, content, etc... so yes, it's tricky but also very offtopic xD
[00:28:45] <ede> i really wish there was more on-topic
[00:29:01] <susi> but there is not, and won't be
[00:29:11] <ede> but what i've seen during the weeks i had matrix running, their room is also rather dead
[00:30:19] <t4nk_freenode> yeah, like answering my question on how to disable those Irritating titles and control buttons underneath the thumbnails of firefox windows in kde
[00:30:46] <t4nk_freenode> and yes, mefistofeles ... I guess I'm counting the acting for a large part too
[00:31:40] <susi> acting was pretty decent, but the stories are the most important part
[00:32:30] <mefistofeles> ede: oh really? Even the official matrix server/room?
[00:33:00] <susi> yes really, this is your best bet to get support
[00:33:13] <ede> i'd have to check where i've been, definitely in firefox (for obvious reasons)
[00:33:40] <ede> was hard enough to get into it

[02:12:43] <KeeperoftheKeys> What is the correct procedure for modifying user.js? according to prefs.js it should not be modified manually but a web search seems to suggest that changes/additions to userjs may also require that firefox not be running at the time they are made
[02:13:26] <KeeperoftheKeys> so if I have a script that detects the presence/absense of a setting and based on what it finds want to modify user.js do I have to kill firefox first?

[02:17:25] <ede> iirc user.js will be included automatically if it exists.
[02:17:55] <ede> during startup. then it's a write only relationship. same for hexchat btw.
[02:18:08] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[02:18:22] <ede> better said, read user.js, write changes to prefs.js.
[02:18:27] <Timvde> KeeperoftheKeys: I think that modifyong user.js while Firefox is running, is okay, but the changes won't be applied until uou restart
[02:20:23] <KeeperoftheKeys> ok so changes won't be applied but firefox also won't overwrite user.js?
[02:20:43] <Timvde> As far as I know, that's correct

[02:31:25] <Timvde> KeeperoftheKeys: I'm not at a pc to test, but a quick search pointed me to about:restartrequired
[02:31:46] <Timvde> You could maybe open that tab somehow, but it's really just the message and it can be ignored

[16:09:15] <Cork> ok, then try creating a new firefox profile and check if you get the same error accessing that url
[16:09:17] <Cork> yes
[16:09:23] <hingoanashi1209> I did
[16:09:31] <hingoanashi1209> I haven't tried it today though
[16:09:51] <Cork> hmm, actually neither did i, it might be missing an intermediate cert
[16:10:41] <Cork> ya, works in a new profile too
[16:11:05] *** Joins: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[16:11:53] <hingoanashi1209> oh it is working for that page for me today
[16:12:20] <hingoanashi1209> It has happened with many pages including those that I could access easily usign http:// from other browsers
[16:12:38] <hingoanashi1209> I unfortunately don't have them handy right now.
[16:12:52] <hingoanashi1209> I'll come back when I remember then or it happens again.
[16:13:04] <Cork> the forcing of https is the header i showed you, if the browser has seen that header it will automatically rewrite http to https
[16:13:13] <hingoanashi1209> unless you have some idea why that might have been happening now Cork 
[16:13:36] <hingoanashi1209> that explains half the problem
[16:13:36] <Cork> so the http => https isn't the problem, it is expected
[16:13:44] <Cork> the problem is that you got certificate error
[16:13:55] <Cork> and the advanced view in firefox can tell you why it is failing
[16:14:01] <hingoanashi1209> yes but I have had that weird message when it wasn't even supposed to be https
[16:14:08] <hingoanashi1209> oh?  how?
[16:14:21] <hingoanashi1209> oh ceritifcate error
[16:14:35] <hingoanashi1209> my real question was how can you bypass a certificate error
[16:14:37] <Cork> so ya, if you get certificate errors again go to advance and view certificate
[16:14:56] <Cork> there you can see why the cert error is shown and why
[16:14:58] <hingoanashi1209> some of the other pages were from friends who were lax it renewing their certificates -- I do remember that.
[16:15:14] <Cork> ya, so expired certificates
[16:15:18] <Cork> that is expected to fail
[16:15:20] <hingoanashi1209> what do you mean 'go to advanced'
[16:15:30] <Cork> when loading of https:// fails
[16:15:34] <hingoanashi1209> yes but can you bypass the expired certificate?
[16:15:41] <hingoanashi1209> and access it anyway
[16:15:42] <Cork> you get a "get me out of here" or something like that
[16:15:45] <hingoanashi1209> if you trust it
[16:15:47] <Cork> ya
[16:15:59] <hingoanashi1209> it hasn't been offering the 'get me out of here' page for a while
[16:16:03] <Cork> where you accept it is the advanced button :)
[16:16:20] <hingoanashi1209> it USED TO do that, but not for the last 3-4 weeks
[16:16:30] <hingoanashi1209> which is what brought me here
[16:16:50] <hingoanashi1209> I was wondering if firefox had changed its policy and was no longer allowing that bypass.
[16:16:56] <Cork> when you trust an expired certificate you add that specific certificate to your trust store
[16:17:06] <hingoanashi1209> how?
[16:17:09] <Cork> so note that that is not "ignore errors from this domain"
[16:17:25] <hingoanashi1209> sorry, I'm not that knowledgable about certificate related stuff
[16:17:51] <Cork> when you get an error for a certificate, the advanced view lets you trust that specific certificate
[16:18:04] <hingoanashi1209> how do you find the certificate if that page never comes up anymore
[16:18:12] <Cork> in some situations it means that if they actually fix the site you might have to fiddle that certificate out and remove it from your cert store
[16:18:31] <hingoanashi1209> up untill less than a month ago when that happened it would bring up a page that would give you options.
[16:18:41] <hingoanashi1209> but I don't get that page anymore
[16:19:17] <Cork> about:preferences > Privacy & Security > scroll down to Certificates > View Certificates > Servers
[16:19:24] <Cork> there is the certificates you've trusted
[16:19:53] <hingoanashi1209> I don't understand 1) how to find out what the certificate is if it doesn't give me that page anymore    and  2) what is and how to set the trust store
[16:20:07] <hingoanashi1209> pj
[16:20:10] <hingoanashi1209> oh
[16:20:11] <Cork> ah you mean the cert for a site
[16:20:15] <hingoanashi1209> yes
[16:20:42] <Cork> the shield to the left of the url
[16:20:57] <hingoanashi1209> oh?
[16:21:12] <Cork> (connection security > more information > view certificate)
[16:22:36] <hingoanashi1209> I don't see that
[16:22:50] <Cork> make sure you're on an https site
[16:23:49] <hingoanashi1209> it shows "tracking content", protection settings and protections dashboard
[16:24:12] <Cork> ugg i said shield didn't i...
[16:24:15] <Cork> i meant the lock -_-'
[16:24:26] <hingoanashi1209> oh
[16:25:05] <hingoanashi1209> ok click on connection secure then more information
[16:25:50] <hingoanashi1209> and if will show that even if the certificat is expired?
[16:26:29] <Cork> the "Expires on" column
[16:26:47] <Cork> or if your in the view certificate its Not After
[16:27:55] <hingoanashi1209> oh, my point is that I clicked on "connection secure"  if the certificate has expired would it still say "cnnection secure"?
[16:28:13] <Cork> if you've trusted the expired certificate, yes
[16:28:27] <hingoanashi1209> too bad I don't know a site with an expired certificate at the moment
[16:28:38] <hingoanashi1209> then what do I do to allow that expired certificate
[16:28:58] <hingoanashi1209> there is no way to bypass the certificat?  i.e. not require one
[16:29:47] <hingoanashi1209> You used to be able to click on something that said   proceed anyway   or something to that effect.
[16:29:53] <hingoanashi1209> Has that been done away with?
[16:30:27] <Cork> that is the advanced view i talked about
[16:30:34] <Cork> it has been hidden a few extra layers
[16:30:41] <hingoanashi1209> ??
[16:31:03] <hingoanashi1209> I used to see that but it doesn't seem to show anymore -- do I have to do something to make it show up?
[16:31:10] <hingoanashi1209> I mean the option for that page
[16:31:37] <Cork> it is on the error page for the site
[16:34:14] <hingoanashi1209> It USED TO show up when there were certificate problems but doesnt come up (at least automatically) when there is a bad certificate any more
[16:34:28] <Cork> that depends on the error
[16:34:32] <hingoanashi1209> i.e. the error page has changed
[16:34:37] <Cork> some errors can't be ignored, ex cipher errors
[16:34:54] <Cork> (those have never been able to ignore)

[16:36:33] <hingoanashi1209> this has only been happening for the last month or less

[16:36:56] <Cork> that is what you should get
[16:37:00] <hingoanashi1209> could I have disabled it accidentally?
[16:37:05] <Cork> no
[16:37:26] <hingoanashi1209> yes that is exactly what I always used to get up until a few weeks ago.
[16:37:38] <Cork> revoked certificates can't be trusted
[16:37:45] <Cork> so that might be what you saw
[16:37:53] <Cork> the error on the page matters ex. https://revoked.badssl.com/
[16:38:05] <hingoanashi1209> my point is that I'm not getting that page when there are certificate errors any more
[16:38:23] <Cork> you don't get anypage at all from the links i gave you?
[16:38:34] <hingoanashi1209> I've never seen that one
[16:38:40] <Cork> the first one
[16:39:05] <hingoanashi1209> no I got the old certificate page at https://expired.badssl.com
[16:39:18] <Cork> ya, then you get the page
[16:39:20] <hingoanashi1209> I just never get that when there is a bad certificate anymore
[16:39:29] <hingoanashi1209> the direct link one, yes
[16:39:34] <Cork> it depends on what error there is
[16:39:46] <Cork> there is a lot of errors a server can have
[16:39:46] <hingoanashi1209> and that is exactly what I used to get when there were certificate errors
[16:40:32] <Cork> ex. https://tls-v1-0.badssl.com:1010/
[16:40:50] <Cork> so again without knowing what error you got i can only guess at the cause
[16:41:46] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[16:41:52] <hingoanashi1209> obviously the website I gave as an example page probably updated their certificate and that is why it now works
[16:42:01] <hingoanashi1209> didn't I give it above
[16:42:41] <Cork> they updated the certificate a little over a week ago
[16:42:47] <hingoanashi1209> : The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified
[16:42:57] <hingoanashi1209> is what I get now
[16:43:37] <Cork> if possibly try to grab the Error code: <info>
[16:43:46] <hingoanashi1209> odd, because the problem was happening more recently for some pages on that site but not others
[16:43:47] <Cork> that is what tells exactly what the problem is
[16:44:06] <hingoanashi1209> you mean <ctrl>i   ?
[16:44:49] <hingoanashi1209> for the error page?
[16:45:56] <Cork> https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/gallery/images/2018-06-22-05-51-46-a35712.png
[16:46:03] <Cork> i mean the Error code: you see there
[16:46:39] <Cork> (third line if you includ the title)
[16:47:13] <hingoanashi1209> what am I supposed to get for https://tls-v1-0.badssl.com:1010/
[16:47:28] <Cork> Error code: SSL_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION
[16:47:59] <Cork> unless you've forced enable tls 1.0 support
[16:48:04] <hingoanashi1209> aha, that looks like the page I got, but I don't remember the top part

[16:49:25] <Cork> hingoanashi1209: ya, the text you gave is just the generic "sometrhing about the security validation for this domain failed"
[16:49:30] <hingoanashi1209> but I would only bypass if I know the owner of the website and trust them
[16:49:45] <hingoanashi1209> how do I get the extra information?
[16:49:54] <Cork> it is printed right on the page
[16:50:08] <Cork> see the image i linked before
[16:50:29] <hingoanashi1209> on that page.  I believe if it had been on the page I got before, something that specific, I certainly would have included it.
[16:51:18] <hingoanashi1209> I guess it is kind of hard for you to help me in a vaccuum, i.e. with no example page happening right now.
[16:51:41] <Cork> without the error code for what was wrong on the server i can't help you ya
[16:52:00] <Cork> but if you get that error it often means the server has a configuration error one way or another
[16:52:02] <hingoanashi1209> but basically the answer is that unless I get that page with the 'advanced' option there is nothing I can do????
[16:52:35] <hingoanashi1209> yes, but often it is friends who aren't professionals, so errors happen but I want to be able to visit the pages anyway
[16:52:47] <hingoanashi1209> or even my own
[16:53:17] <hingoanashi1209> though I just still use http not https  (hence the lack of knowledge about certificates)
[16:53:37] <hingoanashi1209> and it is just for my use and my friends' use
[16:53:44] <Cork> yes, as then it means the connection can't be established cause either: 1) the server is completely broken, 2) the server uses a certificate that is revoked (lets encrypt revoked all certificates at the end of jan so matches this problem)
[16:53:53] <Cork> 3) cipher doesn't match so can't talk to the server
[16:53:58] <Cork> else you can override it
[16:54:00] <hingoanashi1209> aha
[16:54:09] <hingoanashi1209> why did it revoke certificates?
[16:54:16] <Cork> issuing error on there side
[16:54:29] <hingoanashi1209> oh and that corresponds with when I started getting the new error page
[16:55:08] <hingoanashi1209> instead of the one with the 'advanced' option
[16:55:34] <Cork> https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2022-01-25-issue-with-tls-alpn-01-validation-method/170450
[16:55:58] <Cork> it isn't a new page, just a different one then if the cert expired
[16:56:15] <hingoanashi1209> I wonder if all the pages I got it for were using letsencrypt
[16:56:22] <Cork> it just revoked means the issuer says "this certificate/key is dangerus. don't trust it"
[16:56:41] <Cork> quite likely, it is widely used today
[16:57:33] <hingoanashi1209> but back to the original question.  If I don't get that 'advanced' page you said I should add the expired certificate somewhere and that I could find it from ???  (the <ctrl>i  info page for the error message page??????
[16:57:48] <Cork> no other way around
[16:57:53] <Cork> advanced does that
[16:58:04] <Cork> if you don't get advanced you can't trust the certificate
[16:58:29] <hingoanashi1209> my problem is that the times I really want to just trust it and bypass any security issues, I don't get the page with the 'advanced' option any more.
[16:58:47] <hingoanashi1209> I don't care about the certificate
[16:58:56] <Cork> ya, cause as i said, the issuer sais the certificate is not something one can trust
[16:59:00] <Cork> it is revoked
[16:59:08] <Cork> and you can't ever trust a revoked certicficate
[16:59:17] <hingoanashi1209> I trust the page on my own certificate or no certificate
[16:59:26] <Cork> then replace the certificate on the server
[16:59:34] <Cork> ex. use a self signed certificate
[16:59:35] <hingoanashi1209> I verify that it is their page via other means and then just want to go to the page
[16:59:58] <hingoanashi1209> I don't understand 
[17:00:11] <hingoanashi1209> I don't have access to their server.
[17:00:14] <Cork> i've said multiple times: a revoked certificate is hard blocked
[17:00:18] <Cork> you can't ever EVER trust it
[17:00:23] <hingoanashi1209> If I did I'd just copy the page over or something
[17:00:52] <Cork> there is only one thing you can do either fix the server, or contact the maintainer and have them fix it
[17:01:11] <hingoanashi1209> it is highly unlikely it is revoked (unless they decided they didn't want it any more and there was a miscommunication with the issuer)
[17:01:23] <hingoanashi1209> it is very very likely to have expired
[17:01:35] <Cork> no, revoked means the issuer not the one wanting the cert revoked it
[17:01:41] <hingoanashi1209> would they revoke it for a billing dispute?
[17:01:59] <Cork> and as i linked you lets encrypt revoked all certificates issued from start of 2022 to 2022-01-25
[17:02:04] <hingoanashi1209> e.g. if they cancelled the certificate and were billed anyway
[17:02:12] <Cork> lets encrypt is free, so no
[17:02:20] <hingoanashi1209> ok
[17:02:26] <Cork> but yes, a certificate can be revoked cause it wasn't payed
[17:02:40] <Cork> if it is a buseness issuing the certificate
[17:02:53] <hingoanashi1209> if it is a friend's site I don't care about certificates.  can't I find some way of accessing it?
[17:03:07] <Cork> see above -_-'
[17:03:18] <Cork> i'm not going to keep telling the same thing
[17:03:52] <Cork> if a certificate is revoked, it is for a very good reason, it isn't just willy nilly revoked
[17:04:08] <hingoanashi1209> I'm clearly not understanding something.  Are you saying it is impossible to access using firefox, or are you saying there is something I could do to be able to access it?
[17:04:12] <Cork> either someone has found the private key leaked somewhere (doesn't have to be the owner)
[17:04:19] <Cork> or the issuer found a bug somewhere
[17:04:27] <hingoanashi1209> I didn't understand what you meant by 'trust store'  or whatever you called it.
[17:04:41] <hingoanashi1209> and I don't care about that
[17:04:48] <Cork> hingoanashi1209: if the certificate is revoked, no browser at all using a revocation list can access it
[17:05:00] <Cork> and the one doing it has a security problem
[17:05:11] <hingoanashi1209> I have been able to access them with elinks at least once
[17:05:23] <Cork> then they have a security problem
[17:05:45] <hingoanashi1209> yes but it doesn't matter
[17:05:48] <Cork> revoked certificates can't be trusted as that means you can be spoofed
[17:05:54] <Cork> ut matters a lot
[17:06:11] <hingoanashi1209> if it goes to the right ip address
[17:06:11] <Cork> the domain name is just a pointer and can fairly easily be redirected to a different domain

[17:07:18] <hingoanashi1209> to make sure it isn't being forwarded elsewhere
[17:07:30] <Cork> no you can't
[17:07:33] <hingoanashi1209> oh?
[17:07:34] <Cork> but what ever
[17:07:39] <hingoanashi1209> I'm lost
[17:07:41] <hingoanashi1209> sorry
[17:07:50] <hingoanashi1209> I mean if I could access it.
[17:08:15] * Cork dropps this loop, it isn't going anywhere
[17:08:37] <hingoanashi1209> Can I come back with a specific problem when it happens again.
[17:08:57] <hingoanashi1209> But you were going to tell me how to permit an expired certificate, I thought
[17:09:05] <Cork> if it is a revoked certificate just tell the site to update there certificate
[17:09:12] <Cork> there isn't anything anyone else can do
[17:09:17] <hingoanashi1209> by putting it in  a ????"trust store"???
[17:09:22] <Cork> no
[17:09:25] <hingoanashi1209> not revoked, expired
[17:09:29] <Cork> if it is revoked TELL THE OWNER
[17:09:36] <hingoanashi1209> yes, exactly
[17:09:42] <hingoanashi1209> but if it is just expired
[17:11:02] <hingoanashi1209> if they have a revoked certificate, can they remove it and get a certificate from somewhere else?  (e.g. in cases like what happened with letsencrypt
[17:11:05] <hingoanashi1209> }
[17:12:54] <Peng> They can get another Let's Encrypt certificate, even
[17:13:08] <hingoanashi1209> I'm not asking to access websites with revoked certificates -- I would contact them to let them know of something this serious.  Just expired ones.
[17:14:05] <hingoanashi1209> That was an incidental question out of curiosity arising from the discussion.   What I wanted to know is what to do to accept the expired certificate.  You said it could be done by adding it to some sort of 'trust store'  right?
[17:18:11] <hingoanashi1209> this is what I wanted to know about:  <Cork> when you trust an expired certificate you add that specific certificate to your trust store
[17:18:45] <hingoanashi1209> most of this thread has been diverted from that original question
[17:19:22] <hingoanashi1209> I never wanted to talk about revoked certificates, just expired ones.

[23:14:03] <Caspy7[m]> I'm frequently wary of distro builds when weird things happen as the packager will sometimes screw things up.
[23:15:47] <Caspy7[m]> wonder if they've changed the pref
[23:15:47] <Caspy7[m]> there used to be a pref for telling Firefox to ignore updating the search engine...
[23:17:21] <Caspy7[m]> that is, if you have never switched to an alternate (non default) search engine, then if Mozilla decides to change the default (like they did with yahoo once) it will be updated, but there was a pref to ignore that
[23:17:21] <Caspy7[m]> I *think* once upon a time some distros screwed up things and keep resetting the search engine and unchecking that options prevents that
[23:19:27] <pandark-net> ok i need to ask Solus team ?

[23:43:35] <dardevelin> hello fellow firefox users.
[23:43:36] <dardevelin> I am attempting to find out which firefox preference sets the default mailto serviceHandler.
[23:43:36] <dardevelin> I am using selenium and have added my own serviceHandler, but now I need to set it to become the default dynamically.
[23:43:37] <dardevelin> Any help/hint would be appreciated
[23:43:37] <dardevelin> Things i ruled out already:
[23:43:38] <dardevelin> `options.preferences['network.protocol-handler.external.mailto'] = False`
[23:43:38] <dardevelin> disables mailto handling completely
[23:43:39] <dardevelin> `options.preferences['gecko.handlerService.defaultHandlersVersion'] = 5`
[23:43:39] <dardevelin> this is so that firefox refreshes the list of provided handlers, so i have used to such that it lists my custom option.
[23:43:40] <dardevelin> What is your custom option, You might ask ?
[23:43:40] <dardevelin> `options.preferences['network.protocol-handler.expose.your_custom_protocol'] = True`
[23:43:41] <dardevelin> `options.preferences['gecko.handlerService.schemes.mailto.4.name'] = 'local_email_handler'`
[23:43:41] <dardevelin> `options.preferences['gecko.handlerService.schemes.mailto.4.uriTemplate'] = 'https://localhost:8080/?to=%s'`
[23:44:27] <masoudd> use a paste site next time
[23:44:34] <dardevelin> my preference shows in the option list
[23:44:34] <dardevelin> just can't mark it to be selected by default.
[23:44:35] <dardevelin> I have attempted to change using the UI and see what would change in "about:config" but could not identify
[23:44:59] <dardevelin> masoudd  👍
[23:45:17] <masoudd> so rude
[23:45:45] <dardevelin> so unhelpful

[23:45:55] <masoudd> why would I help a rude person
[23:47:31] <dardevelin> rude because I greeted, and provided a full question that demonstrated to actually have done research, and struggled to find documentation ?
[23:47:31] <dardevelin> i am sorry, i don't believe we have the same definition of rude.
[23:47:32] <dardevelin> also when you mentioned to use paste site next time, i said "thumbs up" which is the same as understood
[23:47:46] <labrador> yeh masoudd kinda weird...
[23:47:58] <masoudd> you are still using the enter key as a punctuation
[23:48:22] <labrador> I dunno masoudd seems like pretty long sentences to me...

[23:52:07] <dardevelin> I guess i'll just dedicate the time to patch and improve chrome like the rest of the world and drop firefox. this is effectively always the experience one gets
[23:52:12] <dardevelin> disappointment
[23:53:22] <masoudd> go to https://chat.mozilla.org and talk with the devs. You might have better chance there
[23:53:34] <dardevelin> thank you
