[00:00:09] <emcodem> this is why i say it is easier to first identify your "non matching source files" and transfrom them into something that can be used in concat?
[00:00:46] <jokoon> also found this: ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=channel_layout=stereo:sample_rate=44100 -i video.mov -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest output.mov
[00:01:08] <emcodem> something like that
[00:01:33] <emcodem> there are multiple ways how to generate a silent input
[00:02:06] <emcodem> all of them use -f lavfi AFAIK
[00:03:24] <emcodem> it gets more interesting if you got to generate a special audio layout e.g. not 1 track stereo hehe

[00:19:58] <hyrc> i find no tools to scale/amplify mp3 or opus without re-encoding
[00:21:28] <kepstin> technically, the old 'mp3gain' tool can rescale mp3 without re-encoding, and opus (in ogg container) has a field in the header that's pretty universally respected for gain adjustment.
[00:21:34] <kepstin> i'm not sure what tools support modifying that field in ogg opus tho.
[00:22:03] <emcodem> it will depend on the decoder if thats supported tough
[00:24:11] <kepstin> I have no idea if ffmpeg has it wired up, but anything using libopusfile gets that automatically.

[00:25:36] <kepstin> (the ogg opus spec - rfc 7845 - merely says that "Players and media frameworks SHOULD apply it by default.")
[00:26:11] <kepstin> and notes that any other gain configured should be applied in addition to the output gain field from the header, not instead.

[00:33:26] <hyrc> thank you kepstin
[00:33:47] <hyrc> i have very low bitrate opus in a video and re-encoding is not an option
[00:33:55] <hyrc> but i need +8dB at least gain
[00:34:06] <kepstin> if it's in a video, then the ogg opus header gain field does not apply
[00:34:30] <kepstin> (since that's a field of the ogg opus metadata specification, not a change to the bitstream itself)
[00:34:38] <hyrc> mhm
[00:35:09] <kepstin> if it's in an mp4 file you can add replaygain tags, and mpv can use those during playback :)
[00:35:19] <hyrc> i'd need to learn the two codecs SILC and that other one, in opus, and how to scale the audio
[00:35:21] <kepstin> doesn't solve the problem in general, but maybe in limited circumstances it's enough

[00:37:57] <kepstin> maybe talk to some of the folks in #opus - but note that since the encoding's a fair bit more complex than e.g. mp3, modifying the bitstream to change the gain would probably be very complicated if it's possible at all :/
[00:40:34] <hyrc> yes opus has this hybrid mode between both encoder algos

[05:27:15] <hyrc> then compand would be good to use
[05:27:19] <iconoclasthero> blows out your eardrums.
[05:27:52] <iconoclasthero> how did you settle on -b:a 16384 ?
[05:28:19] <hyrc> it's 2^14
[05:28:35] <iconoclasthero> ah
[05:28:36] <hyrc> i was doing ~12khz for a while, then i gave it a bit more
[05:28:43] <hyrc> interesting we both ended up around 17kbit/s
[05:28:56] <hyrc> sorry 12kbit/s
[05:29:13] <iconoclasthero> yeah...  i just took a look at what all the overall bit rates were for the spinoza problem and they range from...
[05:29:42] <iconoclasthero> 17.4-19.3
[05:30:05] <iconoclasthero> and yes, i find that very interesting, i think that's generally the transparancy point
[05:30:50] <hyrc> i wouldn't call it transparency point, i'd call it 'pain point'
[05:31:01] <hyrc> but i have thousands of hours of the stuff so i need small
[05:31:43] <hyrc> as soon as they bring in the background music it's hurtin time
[05:32:13] <iconoclasthero> i was trying to find what books I had that were small that i could knock out since i've been listening to a bunch of really long ones lately (e.g., Bevoor, WWII).  I think my opus directory is 4600 hours
[05:32:42] <iconoclasthero> 4534:26:14 /library/books/opus
[05:32:43] <hyrc> there's also listenable text to speech now, nothing compared to a good human reader
[05:33:08] <hyrc> but the HTS stuff at least does a good job emulating pitch changes over a sentence
[05:33:18] <hyrc> *human pitch changes
[05:33:32] <iconoclasthero> yeah, the local NPR affiliate, WHYY has a show called The Pulse and they had something on that that I haven't had a chance to listen to yet
[05:34:10] <iconoclasthero> https://whyy.org/episodes/how-we-process-information/
[05:37:58] <iconoclasthero> adding -application voip does something because they're different overall bitrates (17.5 vs 17.6 kb/s) and file sizes.  i'm sure i'm not going to be able to tell the difference though
[05:40:29] <hyrc> opus hybrid codec is complicated.  docs are online
[05:41:02] <hyrc> there's nothing meaningful for me to tweak in it at these bitrates
[05:41:18] <hyrc> getting below 10kbit/s looks different

[05:48:59] <hyrc> third track is the bass kick, from a 1979 song
[05:50:52] <iconoclasthero> you isolated that from the other spectra there?
[05:51:21] <hyrc> yes, but just the kick, not the bass or the rest of the low freqs

[05:56:52] <iconoclasthero> your filter cut the spinoza problem down from 103MB to 94MB

[05:57:45] <hyrc> the gate drops out quiet stuff so encoder doesn't waste bits on it

[06:02:49] <iconoclasthero> after clayton recorded that for the stones, she went home and miscarried.
[06:04:17] <hyrc> maybe the unborn shouldn't be exposed to some things
[06:06:09] <iconoclasthero> perhaps, then again, an unviable fetus is an unviable fetus so it likely would have happened anyway.

[06:13:40] <hyrc> have you ever split up a long video to do parallel encodes?
[06:14:03] <iconoclasthero> i've done it with books that aren't split into chapters/parts
[06:14:17] <hyrc> seems like someone might have done a frontend for this to make it easier
[06:14:39] <iconoclasthero> for splitting files?
[06:14:55] <iconoclasthero> there's a parallel fucntion for ffmpeg i saw
[06:15:29] <iconoclasthero> -slices E..Vâ€¦. number of slices, used in parallelized encoding (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
[06:15:32] <hyrc> split up a long video to chunks, copy to shared filesystem on different computers, start ffmpeg jobs when one of the computers finishes the last one, reassemble output
[06:15:40] <klaxa> i dabbed in that stuff, for some reason my merged files are wonky https://github.com/klaxa/distributed-encoding i haven't really deeply investigated what was going on though
[06:15:57] <hyrc> thanks
[06:16:20] <klaxa> maybe you can figure out what made them break, i'm pretty sure my chunks are exact GOPs

[06:18:14] <klaxa> i think my mkvmerge command made every gop a chapter and at the gop boundaries playback would stutter and i think even skip some frames
[06:18:34] <hyrc> what was your target codec that yielded that issue?
[06:19:21] <klaxa> x264
[06:19:30] <klaxa> just realized it needs a mongo-db

[06:20:05] <another|> klaxa: played around with it ages ago. IIRC it was fixed by using ts as intermediary
[06:20:35] <another|> I still have a partial rewrite somewhere
[06:23:36] <hyrc> i had read about using ts for this also
[06:23:51] <klaxa> yeah i think using ts should fix that actually
[06:24:45] <klaxa> would need to handle subtitles and other extradata special though
[06:25:34] <hyrc> i would just farm out the video encode.  audio and subs can be final pass
[06:25:51] <hyrc> x265 is what's hurting me atm
[06:26:02] <klaxa> hmm yeah good point actually, audio should be fine on one machine
[06:26:29] <klaxa> but still if you want a cool full solution you'd need to handle subs and extradata

[15:47:22] <MG2021> hi
[15:48:11] <MG2021> which would basically be:
[15:48:12] <MG2021> 0. (open mingw-64bit console)
[15:48:12] <MG2021> 1. cd /home/user/FFmpeg-7ab92509994dac1dc181cc5f99c45e3e80cd13bf
[15:48:13] <MG2021> 2. ./configure --enable-decoder='bink2,bink' --enable-demuxer='bink,bink2' --enable-sdl2
[15:48:13] <MG2021> 3. make
[15:48:14] <MG2021> so, I compiled that ffmpeg repo as is, that linked and got this
[15:48:32] <MG2021> wait its frozen i think
[15:48:32] <MG2021> open in vlc or something and youll see, the bink2 ffmpeg decoder seems unfinished
[15:48:33] <MG2021> or I somehow compiled it wrong but i doubt that
[15:48:59] <MG2021> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/548404410439696436/917362323017068555/unknown.png
[15:49:30] <MG2021> Reading some of the messages on the mailing list, and I'm not sure this actually got finished.
[15:49:34] <JEEB> yes, I think you have been told X times that the decoder is unfinished, and needs someone to make it match reference (whatever the missing pieces are)
[15:50:10] <MG2021> what should i do now
[15:51:41] <JEEB> once again this is something I've noted to you earlier, either finish it up yourself, or have someone else do it. as you can clearly see there is code that does XYZ % of the stuff for various variants.
[15:52:25] <JEEB> but yea, enjoy the partial patch :)
[15:55:09] <MG2021> I also told you quadrillion a time that it can only be done by you that you only duck!
[15:55:15] <MG2021> -_-
[15:55:38] <JEEB> if that was true there wouldn't be as many first-time contributors to FFmpeg
[15:57:02] <MG2021> I'm sorry, but I have no money to give to developers for this!
[15:57:32] <JEEB> I did not bring up money in any way or form in this discussion.
[15:57:52] <JEEB> I have literally given protips to people who've wanted to literally contribute features etc for ages on these channels :P
[15:58:31] <JEEB> since FFmpeg is not a coherent single group but an open source project, the primary method of contribution is your time and effort.
[15:58:57] <JEEB> that is what I meant, there are plenty of people who get interested in X, and start hacking on it :P
[15:59:07] <JEEB> people also take over people's patch sets
[15:59:43] <JEEB> someone didn't take something to a finish line, so someone else takes over
[16:01:43] <JEEB> I mentioned this earlier, but the only reason I ever brought up money is because you cannot give people more time (and durandal was hinting at being open for being sponsored for taking it to finish line himself). it's definitely not the first way I'd approach a problem or a wish I see in a project :P
[16:03:07] <JEEB> but yea if you plan on working that my initial recommendation would be to decode a reference of a clip with the official tools into Ut Video or something else lossless
[16:03:45] <MG2021> do you know that official author
[16:04:12] <MG2021> i mean the auth of the agpl codes
[16:04:26] <JEEB> oh yea, he's a cool guy. moved to playing with rust nowadays.
[16:04:32] <JEEB> good ol' kostya
[16:05:07] <JEEB> but yea, it's AGPL so not really useful in the FFmpeg context. I think technically there's one project that can utilize code from nihav without AGPL
[16:05:13] <MG2021> are you sure hes coolÂ =$ -_-
[16:05:15] <JEEB> rust-av I think
[16:06:01] <JEEB> yea, he left an impression of a nice enough person - both IRL and on the interwebs
[16:06:44] <JEEB> I don't think he's got any interest in poking at FFmpeg or related projects any more :) but that's fine.
[16:06:47] <JEEB> he's found his happy spot
[16:07:47] <MG2021> It is possible to add this patch to ffmpeg right now
[16:08:29] <JEEB> I'd rather have a decoder that can decode at least one variant properly :P
[16:08:40] <JEEB> we don't generally take in stuff that is clearly borked for its use

[16:41:39] <vlt> To later be used as a "w" or "x" argument to some filters, for example?
[16:42:19] <BtbN> I'm pretty sure it's not that advanced
[16:42:31] <BtbN> it only exists to overcome command line length limits
[16:42:37] <powerman2206> So if I do `ffmpeg -i a.mp4 -i b.mp3 -c copy -map 0 -map 1 out.mp4`, it'll put the `b` audio stream into the `a` video?
[16:43:11] <BtbN> It should, yeah. I'm not entirely sure if mp3 fits into mp4 though
[16:43:35] <powerman2206> But as a general command, it works, alright
[16:43:51] <powerman2206> Second question: how will that stream be named in the `out.mp4` file?
[16:43:56] <powerman2206> 1:a:0 or 0:a:0?
[16:45:13] <vlt> BtbN: So -complex_filter_script might be able to read from ENV?
[16:45:22] * vlt tries
[16:45:30] <c_14> powerman2206:  assuming input 0 doesn't have any audio streams the stream will be designated a:0
[16:45:45] <BtbN> What do you mean?
[16:45:59] <powerman2206> c_14: nice, thanks
[16:46:00] <BtbN> It'll just read the file and parse it instead of the argument
[16:47:48] <vlt> BtbN: Ok, thank you.

[19:49:52] <Keve> Hello ffmpeg-ers!
[19:49:53] <Keve> I could use some pointers to get me started with a programming upgrade. I have a working C++ dialog-based MFC Application, developed in Visual Studio 2019 Community. It is a hobby project, nothing special or mission critical, it is my way of testing and learning things.   In order to perform one of its current tasks, this application sometimes
[19:49:53] <Keve> starts an external ffmpeg.exe process, recording a few minutes of screen video.
[19:49:54] <Keve> It is now time to make some upgrades to my Application, and I would also prefer to compile the 'ffmpeg.exe -f gdigrab -framerate 5 -i desktop -c:v libx264 somewhere\scrrec.avi' functionality into my code, so I would no longer need the external ffmpeg.exe binary. Framerate (5), output (libx264/AVI), or input (entire screen) will never change. Only
[19:49:54] <Keve> the output file path/name will.
[19:49:55] <Keve> What do I need to start trying to compile this functionality into my code? Are there any suggested readings on this topic, or example code to study?
[19:51:04] <another|> let avi die please
[19:52:40] <hyrc> i haven't done it but isnt that a matter of usinng e.g. libavcodec api
[19:52:48] <Keve> I don't care much about the output container format. MKV. MP4, AVI makes no difference to me.
[19:53:28] <JEEB> Keve: basically you need libavformat (libavdevice to be exact but the API is the same) for the gdigrab input format
[19:53:40] <JEEB> generally, take a look at the transcoding example
[19:54:56] <powerman2206> another|: it's- huh
[19:54:58] <powerman2206> It's not here
[19:55:42] <powerman2206> Oh wait it's a little lower with the meradata `LANGUAGE: eng`, but like- hold on
[19:56:12] <JEEB> Keve: a protip if you need docs often just searching with keywords "site:ffmpeg.org doxygen trunk KEYWORD" helps. that stuff is all built into the code base but sometimes it's simpler to just look at the already generated HTML version than build it yourself :)

[20:10:41] <Keve> Are there any documentation on setup/configuration steps I need to perform in Visual Studio to include FFMpeg functions in my project?
[20:13:47] <JEEB> not really, other than general C++ related stuff if your project is C++ (the usual extern C stuff when including the headers)
[20:14:24] <JEEB> for visual studio I think nowadays someone integrated FFmpeg into some of their package management things, so just keep in mind what sort of license configuration it sets up, but it should be capable of building you a matching visual studio build of FFmpeg
[20:14:34] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[20:14:39] <JEEB> well, with libx264 it's going to be GPL unless you did commercial licensing of x264

[20:15:15] <JEEB> this is how ffms2 switched to vcpkg for FFmpeg
[20:15:57] <JEEB> apparently vs2019 has integrated vcpkg
[20:16:22] <JEEB> the vcpkg stuff is 100% 3rd party so FFmpeg itself has nothing to do with it, but if it automates the building as opposed to providing random binaries, I think that should be generally OK?

[20:38:07] <JEEB> I haven't utilized vcpkg myself but Myrsloik started using it for FFmpeg
[20:38:08] <JEEB> https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/ffmpeg
[20:38:20] <JEEB> (for ffms2, which is also a MSVS C++ project using FFmpeg)
[20:38:30] <JEEB> so I'd probably try that first, maybe
[20:38:50] <Keve> And I am guessing (but only guessing) that this is where your "vcpkg" comes in. Maybe meaning that VS2019 can download the FFMpeg sources using its built-in extension system?
[20:39:19] <JEEB> not only get the sources but probably also build a configuration matching your requirements more or less
