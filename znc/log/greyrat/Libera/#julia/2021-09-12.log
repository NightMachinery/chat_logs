[03:32:51] <transhumanist> HI! I am new to Julia. I am using Atom, and I did a git-add to add a project, it has a tree and a src folder with about 8 different .jl scripts. how do I actually get it to work with these .jl files that are now "installed" ? thanks in advance for the help

[04:19:38] <mikko> you might want to consider switching to vs code, juno development has moved to the vscode extension
[04:19:45] <mikko> not sure what exactly you are trying to get working though

[06:12:07] <transhumanist> thanks for getting back to me, I know someone living in New Hampshire by the same name as yours! Thanks for responding
[06:12:55] <transhumanist> mikko: I am trying to get this working https://github.com/ordovician/Airship.jl
[06:13:41] <transhumanist> seens there is another step to getting the .jl files functions to be available
[06:14:37] <transhumanist> this is the commonents  functions I want to use https://github.com/ordovician/Airship.jl/tree/master/examples
[06:16:49] <mikko> if you are asking how to import functionality from a 3rd party package you would do that by writing "using Airship" in your code file or repl
[06:22:16] <transhumanist> so a code file is someothing like this https://github.com/ordovician/Airship.jl/blob/master/src/temperature.jl
[06:23:35] <mikko> yes, that is (one of the) source files for that package, presumably you have your own code in another file somewhere
[06:25:39] <transhumanist> so how do I run the source file, thats the last question of the night I promise
[06:26:12] <transhumanist> just type julia temperature.jl
[06:27:15] <mikko> yes
[06:28:00] <mikko> that temperature.jl file doesn't output anything meaningful though, it just defines some functions and types
[06:28:57] <transhumanist> ok thank you I was getting an error https://erik-engheim.medium.com/calculating-lifting-capacity-of-airships-48df5cd7d147 trying to follow the first 6 commands of this how to
[06:30:17] <mikko> what's the error message?
[06:30:35] <transhumanist> umm < I think it was is not defined
[06:30:59] <transhumanist> when I got to the Kelivin Celicius step
[06:31:41] <transhumanist> seemed it left  out some julia specific steps
[06:35:30] <mikko> yeah i think they forgot to mention that you need to do the "using Airship" first to use types like Kelvin and Celsius that are defined in the package
[06:39:03] <transhumanist> ah so typing "using Airship" loads the types liek Kelivn and Celcius? 
[06:39:18] <transhumanist> sorry to bug you with this
[06:39:30] <transhumanist> I am an engineer more than a programmer
[06:40:01] <mikko> yes, it brings types and functions from the package called "Airship" into the current namespace
[06:41:24] <transhumanist> ok thank you I didnt see mention of this command in my searches, I appreciate it
[06:41:54] <mikko> the manual goes bit deeper into it if you're curious https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/#modules
[06:42:37] <transhumanist> I appreciate the pointer
[07:08:03] <transhumanist> sorry one more problem if your around it shows the following error https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/tPqRcwCpZm/ ,  seems they didnt review the article before publishing it
[07:14:31] <mikko> that's because your gas_mass method only understands kelvins
[07:16:38] <mikko> defining this might work (but i am not able to test it myself right now): "gas_mass(P, V, T::Temperature, molecular_mass) = gas_moles(P, V, T) * molecular_mass"
[07:17:49] <mikko> the reason this should work is that looking at the github code you can see that both Kelvin and Celsius are subtypes of Temperature
[07:45:56] <transhumanist> ok thanks
[07:47:44] <mikko> note that i'm not sure if the equation works correct with celsius, if you need different equation for celsius then define that instead
