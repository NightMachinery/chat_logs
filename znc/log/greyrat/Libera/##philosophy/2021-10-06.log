[02:48:53] <tinwhiskers> I guess it's a type of straw man (misrepresenting an opponent's argument by broadening or narrowing the scope of a premise and/or refuting a weaker version of their argument). You never said people don't die, but they are misrepresenting what you said to refute it. You never said seatbelts prevent death.

[03:54:26] <vaquero> if someone doesnt want to wear a seatbelt i care as much as if someone wants to smoke ice. i wouldnt do it but im not going to lose sleep over someone else doing it

[03:55:43] <synaps3> i'm not loosing sleep about it, i just wanna know the name of that fallacy

[03:56:06] <synaps3> it was from another discussion, about metadata

[03:56:48] <synaps3> the other side responded
[03:56:57] <synaps3> but they also kill without metadata
[03:57:01] <synaps3> as a counterargument
[03:57:23] <synaps3> but yeah, antivaxxers use that also
[03:57:27] <synaps3> vaccinated also die bla bla
[03:57:36] <synaps3> i flooded
[03:58:09] <I_Am_M00t> maybe it's a "causal fallacy"

[04:06:24] <vaquero> but im assuming this is a conversation between 2 political parties who are more concerned about being right
[04:07:41] <I_Am_M00t> lol so i was right vaquero ? you are making this about vaccination?
[04:08:45] <vaquero> I_Am_M00t:  no im making this about one side saying they should have the choice to make decisions on others safety and the other side getting baited into the debate instead of just telling them no.
[04:09:14] <synaps3> vaquero, you triggered ?
[04:09:17] <I_Am_M00t> wait, so you are talking about vaccines?
[04:09:29] <vaquero> i got the vaccine, i also wear a seatbelt. i also dont think that means i have the right to tell others how they should live there lives and what risks they are allowed to take.
[04:09:40] <synaps3> i do if it affects me lol
[04:09:44] <I_Am_M00t> i mean he's asking about the name of a logical fallacy, and you're talking about morals

[04:13:20] <synaps3> fun fact
[04:13:37] <vaquero> thats why i got a car with no backseats. ;)
[04:13:45] <I_Am_M00t> lol, anyway there are so many names for logical fallacies
[04:13:59] <vaquero> yeah but fallacies are for fags

[04:14:59] <vaquero> people whose go to response is "well thats a fallacy" typically have nothing worth hearing.  at least thats my experiecne, its almost always a way of dodging and not answering.
[04:15:12] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[04:15:21] <synaps3> well make a better argument then
[04:15:34] <I_Am_M00t> are there mods around?
[04:15:41] <synaps3> it just means make better argument, not that point you wanna make is incorrect
[04:15:44] <I_Am_M00t> since when are homophobic slurs ok?

[07:50:40] <Samian> It's interest that the human brain is so intelligent and yet we have low level subsystems that are so dumb, so much so that the subsystems produce outcomes against our own interests.
[07:51:13] <Samian>  For example, the drive someone has to brag and acting on that drive by actually bragging brings the irs's attention to the guy.  Or you have idiots on youtube posting themselves committing crimes.
[07:52:05] <Samian> The drive for recognition is an example of a low level subsystem that's very low IQ
[07:53:36] <Samian> The drive for destruction is another.   For the average person,  It takes more self control not to act destructive drives than constructive ones.

[08:17:20] <Samian> I said something like if you try to get me fired I'll kill you. Literally 2 mintues later I say I'm sorry I didn't mean it and I'm not a violent person.

[08:17:49] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i am trying to figure out why my wife leaves stuff laying all over
[08:18:08] <Samian> Plank got his github account permanently banned for harassing me, and now he wants revenge.  Plank needs to grow up and do something productive with his time and make something of his own life.
[08:18:15] <I_Am_M00t> biys: some questions don't have answers
[08:18:18] <plank> its not banned btw
[08:18:21] <plank> just flagged
[08:18:25] <I_Am_M00t> say biys, you ever eat like, half a banana ?
[08:18:25] <biys> I_Am_M00t: true
[08:18:34] <biys> I_Am_M00t: yah, i've shared a banana with my son
[08:18:40] <plank> samian you are unstable
[08:18:41] <I_Am_M00t> ... ok well that's ok
[08:18:52] <biys> but if you aren't intending on eating the whole banana yourself
[08:18:55] <I_Am_M00t> but what if you just tear a banana in half and leave the other half?
[08:18:56] <plank> and also a filthy ban evader
[08:18:57] <biys> you probably shouldn't open it
[08:19:01] <biys> fuck no
[08:19:04] <biys> that's savage
[08:19:04] <I_Am_M00t> hmm idk im starting to change my mind on that
[08:19:12] <I_Am_M00t> because sometimes i just want a bit of banana
[08:19:25] <I_Am_M00t> i can have one half, and eat the second half a few hours later
[08:19:32] <biys> but it goes brown
[08:19:34] <biys> gross
[08:19:39] <I_Am_M00t> so? lol
[08:19:42] <I_Am_M00t> are you a child?
[08:19:44] <biys> so?
[08:19:45] <I_Am_M00t> still tastes good
[08:19:50] <biys> but it has brown on it
[08:19:53] <I_Am_M00t> ? so
[08:19:57] <biys> so?
[08:20:01] <I_Am_M00t> lmao, also it's only the outer edge
[08:20:06] <I_Am_M00t> all the rest is yellow
[08:20:15] <biys> also... you asked me if i'm a child
[08:20:22] <biys> i'm not the one eating half a fucking banana
[08:20:25] <biys> are you 3 ?
[08:20:30] <biys> less than three
[08:20:33] <biys> are you 11 months?
[08:20:40] <I_Am_M00t> listen, sometimes i dont want to eat a whole banana
[08:20:44] <I_Am_M00t> i just like it for the taste
[08:21:01] <biys> it's like... not har dto eat a banana
[08:21:04] <biys> are you counting banana calories?
[08:21:10] <I_Am_M00t> there's nothing wrong with splitting a banana, and eating the other half an hour or two later
[08:21:17] <biys> yah idk about that
[08:21:23] <biys> idk what kind of person would even do something like that
[08:21:37] <biys> the only thing i can think is some kind of savage...  likely the same kidn of person who doesn't have a garbage disposal
[08:21:45] <I_Am_M00t> ...
[08:21:55] <I_Am_M00t> biys: now look here
[08:21:58] <biys> you probably just shovel your food waste into a garbage can
[08:22:00] <biys> don't you?
[08:22:00] <I_Am_M00t> im drawing a line
[08:22:20] <I_Am_M00t> i sort my food waste
[08:22:27] <I_Am_M00t> i have 5 different containers thank you
[08:22:36] <biys> how often do your garbage stink when youwalk in your house?
[08:23:01] <I_Am_M00t> idk, it doesn't really crawl through the entire apt
[08:23:12] <I_Am_M00t> lol, just a meter around the actual bin at worst
[08:23:35] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, banana splitting is okay
[08:23:42] <I_Am_M00t> + it's in the fridge
[08:23:52] <biys> i bet you have clothe son your floor somewhere too
[08:23:55] <I_Am_M00t> you're shortsighted, i'm saving the environment
[08:24:01] <I_Am_M00t> you're obsessed with finishing whole bananas
[08:24:10] <I_Am_M00t> yea, sometimes i throw my pants on the floor
[08:24:13] <I_Am_M00t> sue me
[08:24:23] <biys> how often do you wash your sheets?
[08:24:27] <I_Am_M00t> i want half a banana, i eat half a banana
[08:24:30] <biys> you half banana eaters are all the same
[08:24:35] <I_Am_M00t> bananas are not oranges
[08:24:47] <I_Am_M00t> bananas are not peaches
[08:25:07] <I_Am_M00t> get your story straight
[08:25:07] <biys> so i have to come up with a thesis
[08:25:17] <biys> i've decided to write abotu how it's easier to lie and cheat and steal
[08:25:21] <biys> and living an admirable life means nothing
[08:25:39] <biys> this should be easy enough
[08:27:43] <Samian> biys then you sound like a selfish person.
[08:28:08] <Samian> An admirable life means a life in which you give back and pass forward what was passed to you from generations before
[08:28:33] <biys> how do you suppose?
[08:28:52] <biys> so you're saying i'm indebted to people i don't even know for doing things i didn't even ask them to do?
[08:29:21] <I_Am_M00t> biys wouldnt even share a banana
[08:29:28] <I_Am_M00t> forget it
[08:29:35] <biys> i would say that your expectation that anyone ought to live in any one particular way or another is weird
[08:29:42] <Samian> What's admirable is in the eye of the beholder. But I bet the general consensus of what it means to live an admirable life involves making other people's lives more pleasant.
[08:30:00] <I_Am_M00t> yes
[08:30:03] <I_Am_M00t> that's part of it
[08:30:13] <biys> well sure...  that's assuming we can agree that living an admirable life is what's "supposed" to happen
[08:30:26] <biys> idk what kind of contract you signed with the universe
[08:30:28] <biys> but i wanna see it
[08:30:29] <I_Am_M00t> it doesn't always 😅
[08:31:02] <Samian> "it's easier to lie and cheat and steal" <-- I agree
[08:31:13] <I_Am_M00t> love is easy, hate is hard
[08:31:25] <I_Am_M00t> 🙏
[08:31:38] <biys> I_Am_M00t: that sounds like something my mom would post on facebook
[08:31:48] <I_Am_M00t> biys: go to your room
[08:31:53] <biys> calm down boomer
[08:32:07] <Samian> "living an admirable life means nothing" <-- I disagree.  For one, everything means different to different people. A kindly act may mean nothing to you but everything to the person receiving it.  So factually, living an admirable life means something to someone somewhere.
[08:32:18] <I_Am_M00t> i detect an attitude son
[08:32:28] <biys> Samian: i get what you are saying now
[08:32:29] <biys> thank y ou
[08:32:34] <biys> lemme re-word that

[10:17:15] <amigojapan> Must be
[10:18:31] <sdfgsdfg> there are also dead babies, what would happen if media focused on these cases
[10:18:39] <sdfgsdfg> I still think it's a scare campaign
[10:18:57] <sdfgsdfg> they're just showing a tiny slice of the statistics, it's misleading, it's the actual misinformation
[10:21:02] <amigojapan> I_Am_M00t: sdfgsdfg I told him it is now time for him to promote getting the vaccine by telling his story, and watching reliable major news sources
[10:21:39] <I_Am_M00t> O_o    well yeah, he can post it on reddit lol
[10:21:48] <I_Am_M00t> that sub is for that type of stuff
[10:23:06] <sdfgsdfg> I think he would have survived it alright without going to the hospital
[10:23:13] <amigojapan> Ok I_Am_M00t I will try linking him
[10:23:15] <sdfgsdfg> he's exaggerating
[10:24:37] <amigojapan> sdfgsdfg: you have no idea
[10:25:17] <amigojapan> sdfgsdfg: you have not seen his condition and you are not a doctor
[10:25:23] <sdfgsdfg> some people around me got covid and it was quite mild
[10:25:31] <sdfgsdfg> (most are 31 years old)
[10:25:50] <amigojapan> Of course that is not the case for all
[10:26:10] <sdfgsdfg> that's why I was curious about his age :D
[10:26:52] <sdfgsdfg> I'm sure 40 year olds would like to think they're young too ....
[10:27:40] <amigojapan> I am 43 years old
[10:27:53] <sdfgsdfg> you're close to retirement age, almost the end of the road

[18:00:36] <brigand> amigojapan: a colleague asked me if i shouldn't start having kids as i'm "not getting younger". when i responded "no". he joked that "you want it all for yourself, right?" implying i don't wanna share and i'm egoistical. i joked along but it's nagging me and i plan to ask him what he thinks is so altruistic of bringing a person into this world
[18:02:04] <assan> let's not be listening to be satisfied
[18:02:31] <amigojapan> brigand: I feel it is bad to bring people into such a terrible world
[18:03:03] <brigand> *implying i don't wanna share my money
[18:03:07] <brigand> amigojapan: i agree
[18:03:19] <amigojapan> Thanks brigand
[18:04:11] <amigojapan> brigand: you are not hurting unborn people by not sharing your money
[18:04:50] <assan> amigojapan there's nothing terrible about the world, you are the one that couldn't make the marker
[18:04:53] <brigand> i won't tell him how much i donate monthly or how i am an activist for animal rights
[18:06:02] <amigojapan> Good for you brigand
[18:07:06] <amigojapan> assan: tell that to the children starving in Africa

[18:09:03] <amigojapan> assan: there are starving children there as you must know
[18:09:45] <assan> and so what?
[18:10:01] <assan> what of the overfed people in japan?
[18:10:09] <assan> what's the difference?

[18:10:57] <assan> yeah i can see that
[18:11:12] <assan> and what's your care gonna really do about the issue
[18:11:24] <arcturus> i am as well concerned about the endangered animals in africa
[18:11:28] <arcturus> and the poaching etc
[18:13:01] <brigand> less people, less problems
[18:13:02] <amigojapan> assan: I can say that but having more children is a good way to avoid human suffering
[18:13:22] <amigojapan> But having children*
[18:13:31] <amigojapan> Arg
[18:13:39] <amigojapan> Not having children
[18:14:01] <assan> yeah in your understanding
[18:14:20] <assan> because of your life condition
[18:14:24] <assan> which is okay
[18:14:44] <assan> we all see the world through our level of mental comprehension
[18:15:26] <brigand> assan: you can't guarantee your children will have it as good as you. the way the world is developing they will have it worse
[18:15:53] <amigojapan> Agreed

[18:22:36] <amigojapan> brigand: also the wateries are drying up, that worries me
[18:22:38] <assan> they are called the white coated priests
[18:24:00] <amigojapan> brigand: unless we can make sea water into drinking water and farming waste in a large scale
[18:24:37] <arcturus> thats easily done
[18:24:55] <arcturus> nucular or solar desalination
[18:25:17] <amigojapan> arcturus: in large amounts?
[18:25:27] <arcturus> i think so yeah
[18:25:34] <amigojapan> Ah good
[18:25:36] <arcturus> it just isnt done because its relatively expensive
[18:25:49] <arcturus> but when theres no other choice
[18:25:52] <amigojapan> I see
[18:26:55] <amigojapan> I guess water prices will skyrocket then
