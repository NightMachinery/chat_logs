Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this,

But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia 
[00:48:55] <capisce> is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic."

[00:50:10] <capisce> "Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and 
[00:50:16] <capisce> understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world."

[01:37:38] <pie_> everyone is too much of a pussy to cancel russia huh? :P

[01:38:28] <two2thehead> gurkenglas, ah

[01:39:19] <gurkenglas> pie_, i don't like it when china blocks foreign sites, i don't like it here either
[01:39:21] <pie_> im currently too mentally preoccupied with my mom falling for a romance scam

[01:43:44] <gwern> two2thehead: that seems rather milquetoast. when between now and 2000 did putin have any apparent odds of a coup?
[01:44:18] <two2thehead> that's definitely true
[01:44:49] <two2thehead> I think they are just using 2000AD as a measure of uncertainty in leadership change, and not coups against putin per se
[01:45:02] <pie_> is there anyone in the west that would have the guts to make a nuclear threat like putin

[01:46:38] <kuudes> gwern, in 2000 putin did a coup against yeltsin
[01:46:53] <kuudes> 2000-01-01
[01:47:12] <gwern> yeah, but that's given as the start point. when else would putin have been at serious risk? sometime ina chechnyan war? some navalny protest?
[01:47:34] <kuudes> he hasn't. that is referring to disposal of yeltsin imo
[01:47:44] <saturn2> pie_: not since JFK
[01:48:25] <kuudes> was it jfk who escalated it btw?
[01:48:32] <kuudes> was that why there appeared a lone gunman

[01:49:49] <kuudes> I was happier when I didn't think of nuclear blackmails

[01:52:42] <pie_> I expect that russia would have expected this?
[01:52:50] <pie_> or no?
[01:53:13] <saturn2> it looks like putin has miscalculated
[01:53:14] <two2thehead> almost certainly not
[01:53:54] <saturn2> he thought he would take over kyiv before anyone could react
[01:54:18] * gurkenglas .o(video game idea: as you repel the tenth time assassin, finally you steal their time machine intact and take it back to the future for revenge. "Adolf". In "Adolf 2", you discover how "lucky" the cold war actually was and start assassinating world leaders that make nuclear threats)
[01:54:44] <gwern> it looks like he thought the decadent west would more or less be apathetic, germany would carry his water because of terror over energy prices, and that ukraine would have surrendered now and removed the excuse before anything could happen and then it's just two sovereign nations in the privacy of their bedroom enjoying their conjugal union, don't judge
[01:55:05] <kuudes> west would have done that imo, unless he made the nuclear threat
[01:55:14] <kuudes> we are in nuclear/existential war
[01:55:17] <kuudes> this is not about ukraine
[01:55:26] <kuudes> this is about nuclear blackmail
[01:55:35] <gwern> or he was just wrong about both the west and ukraine's backbone. if politics was a science, they'd call it 'political sciene'
[01:55:39] <gwern> * science
[01:56:01] <pie_> the only thing there that putin got wrong from a laymans perspective (which can entirely fairly be made fun of) might be putins backbone
[01:56:17] <pie_> i have pretty bad priors for the west having any backbone, but maybe thats too much tv propaganda
[01:56:29] <pie_> (i am a westerner)
[01:56:39] <pie_> *ukraines backbone
[01:56:40] <pie_> sigh
[01:57:05] <pie_> too soon?

[01:57:53] <pie_> (i saw some random news article scroll earlier by about spacex maybe taking up slack on the ISS if russia backs out dont cite me)
[01:57:54] <gwern> I mentioned well before the invasion that foreigners are always underestimating american backbone and thinking that because they see all these purple-haired fat chicks and homeless crazies in SF that america can't and won't do anything if their noble cleancut military officers attack something for the sake of the homeland
[01:58:05] <gwern> maybe this is a general underestimation
[01:58:13] <saturn2> too bad it took a threat to end the world to get the west to do something right for once
[01:58:42] <pie_> Im basically american even, I just havent been back for a decade because circumstances out of my control
[01:59:08] <gwern> (we tend to focus on the barbian conquests of a great empire every few centuries, and less on all the unsuccessful raids in between)
[01:59:16] <gurkenglas> gwern, would you have expected the same under trump?
[01:59:41] <gwern> gurkenglas: I'm not sure. it's not like biden seemed to do much beyond releasing intelligence regularly
[02:00:02] <kuudes> biden is not the actor. deep state / military intelligence is the actor
[02:00:06] <gwern> and trump was always hamstrung when it came to congress passing some more russian sanctions or whatever. it just looked too bad for him to oppose at all
[02:00:10] <kuudes> the politicians give them permissions
[02:00:29] <kuudes> maybe putin would not have nuclear blackmailed trump?
[02:02:07] <gwern> why? trump was a total failure for putin. he never got anything out of trump or showed any signs of personally liking trump, and if trump had been re-elected, he'd only have like a year or two before total lameduckdom set in
[02:02:40] <gwern> if putin is nuclear-blackmailing the entire West because ukraine is going that badly, I don't think the occupant of the whitehouse makes much of a difference to the choice
[02:03:05] <pie_> > because ukraine is going that badly
[02:03:09] <pie_> interesting point
[02:03:39] <gurkenglas> if we didn't have nukes, would putin be taking civilian hostages?
[02:04:14] <gwern> pie_: I mean, what's the mental model here? "oh, my best bud trump is president, I'll not mention the nukes" "nm it's now Sleep Biden, fuck that dude, suck on my nuclear nuts biatch"
[02:04:30] <gurkenglas> ("we" as "Earth")
[02:04:57] <ardent[m]> I generally would like it if more things accepted privacy crypto e.g. Monero so cutting a person/nation/etc off would be far more infeasible
[02:05:07] <gurkenglas> i'd rather think putin makes nuclear threats against trump too, to give trump an excuse to fold.
[02:05:52] <gurkenglas> let him run the next election on "do you want nuclear war. i dont want nuclear war."
[02:05:55] <pie_> gwern: i didnt mean wrt trump but rather getting out the nuclear card _at all_
[02:06:27] <pie_> i dont have any mental model :-/
[02:07:13] <pie_> how megalomanic is trump? :D
[02:07:24] <pie_> YES LETS NUKE RUSSIA >:D
[02:07:36] <pie_> (and ourselves)
[02:09:17] <gurkenglas> hmm yes i did find trump more likely than your average president to lead into nuclear war. and if china did a nuclear threat he might have called a bluff.

[02:14:39] <pie_> thats kind of sad tbh
[02:15:02] <kuudes> idgi why putin wanted to nuclear escalate
[02:15:16] <gurkenglas> kuudes: i rudely point out that you don't like nuclear blackmail so you'd like people to learn it's a bad idea.
[02:15:38] <kuudes> wait? my english is not good enough to parse that
[02:15:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I concur with gurkenglas
[02:15:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is yet another instance of wishful thinking in Western commentary
[02:16:02] <mjr> kuudes, they're suggesting motivated reasoning on your part
[02:16:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mistaking what you would like to be the case for what is
[02:16:20] <kuudes> mjr, thanks. what part of mine?
[02:16:20] <gurkenglas> kuudes uh, my reply is technically ad hominem so it's not so virtuous to say it.
[02:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's true, therefore it is virtuous to say it
[02:16:36] <mjr> the part where "badly because nuclear blackmail"
[02:16:46] <kuudes> oh
[02:17:15] <kuudes> so do you guys believe the west would have went this far with ukraine without nuclear blackmail?
[02:17:20] <kuudes> hmm
[02:17:34] <kuudes> why is that wishful thinking for my part to believe west would not have done so?
[02:18:01] <gurkenglas> you have lamented that nuclear blackmail is bad. therefore i suggest that you are biased towards concluding it is unwise.
[02:20:05] <two2thehead> kuudes s0ph1a feep TIL that the spacex dragon can, with software updates, be used for attitude control for the ISS

[02:21:49] <gurkenglas> i call it unvirtuous because it bypasses the math underlying debates, I expected Obormot\Arcturus to agree given what he said in an LW comment thread about, iirc, treating people by the same interface in discussions
[02:23:16] <two2thehead> pie_, it would probably have a very fast internet connection
[02:23:18] <gurkenglas> it's like, as soon as you look at an agent's insides rather than their policies, you can't have an optimal decision theory, because you can set up a problem that punishes it for being itself
[02:24:11] <gurkenglas> "i defect iff you would defect against cooperatebot" "okay well then fuck me i guess"
[02:26:18] <kuudes> hmm. so we should use nuclear blackmail more often?
[02:26:28] <kuudes> trump's examples there seem to be passive
[02:26:48] <kuudes> putin's current example seems to be active
[02:26:57] <gurkenglas> i'm not saying it's good! i'm just saying it may be effective.
[02:27:11] <gurkenglas> I'm all in favor of not using it.
[02:27:27] <pie_> they have to believe it
[02:27:35] <pie_> in trumps case it may have been believable
[02:27:42] <kuudes> hmm. I think I now am able to parse your sentence
[02:27:57] <kuudes> but yes, that is true, that is my opinion as you stated? why should I be offended?
[02:28:45] <gurkenglas> because it is valid for you to look at "you're just saying that because you want it to be true" and go "well how am i supposed to argue against that"
[02:28:58] <kuudes> I still believe west is in the current conflict because of the nuclear blackmail, and not because it likes ukraine
[02:29:30] <kuudes> regardless of it I like things or not, that seems true to me

[02:48:18] <feepbot> did not think an invasion was in the works. U.S. intelligence showed that on one occasion, Beijing shared the Americans’ information with Moscow. Recent speeches by some of China’s most influential advisers to the government on international relations suggest that the miscalculation may have been based on deep distrust of the United States. They saw it as a declining power that
[02:48:18] <feepbot> wanted to push for war with false intelligence because it would benefit the United States, financially and strategically. Jin Canrong, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, told the state broadcaster China Central Television, or CCTV, on Feb. 20 that the U.S. government had been talking about imminent war because an unstable Europe would help Washington, as well the

[03:19:17] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, how do you see it, how large fraction of russians does not already know that tomorrow money is worthless?
[03:19:30] <pie_> the flip side of MAD
[03:19:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: That I can't say
[03:20:01] <kuudes> more or less than half?
[03:20:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably less
[03:20:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I am not confident in that
[03:20:29] <kuudes> thanks
[03:20:42] <kuudes> btw do you have any firsthand source on if those tv hacks were real or not?
[03:20:53] <kuudes> ie anyone inside russia that has seen such and said so
[03:21:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't heard about it from my sources in Russia but communication has been fairly sparse
[03:21:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, no confident answer there either
[03:21:38] <kuudes> indeed. thanks
[03:21:52] <gurkenglas> what communication i had from russia was "i am busy getting the fuck out of russia"
[03:22:03] <kuudes> gurkenglas, good
[03:22:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's definitely not what I've had
[03:22:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody I know has said anything even remotely indicating plans to leave
[03:23:32] <kuudes> I have been encouraging dbohdan that if peace breaks out, they should try to leave to west ukraine side
[03:24:04] <kuudes> because I feel if donbas is ceded to russia in peace treaty, there might be some 1-2 weeks before they consolidate
[03:25:00] <gwern> ah, the east berlin moment

[03:28:22] <Robomot> image/png (270x270; 30 KB)
[03:28:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an S in a dashed box, white on a red background
[03:29:29] <gwern> har har, but what is it supposed to be? are these dashes frigging morse code or something
[03:29:41] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly the S is set to autocast
[03:30:24] <rmmh> gwern: it's SOS
[03:30:27] <rmmh> in morse code

[03:31:14] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code hm. 3 long, 3 short, OS? but then what are the ultra-long vertical lines?
[03:31:16] <Robomot> Morse code - Wikipedia
[03:31:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The ultra-long vertical lines are just visual dividers
[03:31:50] <gwern> are the ultra-long ones supposed to be very long 'O'?
[03:31:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, they're nothing
[03:32:15] <rmmh> they're a space between words
[03:32:33] <rmmh> start reading at the stop. 3 short, 3 long, 3 short is S O S
[03:32:46] <rmmh> technically there's supposed to be a gap between letters but that's often dropped for SOS
[03:33:02] <gwern> ...Oh! a book of his is officially titled 'Schneier on Security' and he even abbreviates it 'SOS' http://www.schneier.com/book-sos.html
[03:33:03] <Robomot> Schneier on Security: : Schneier on Security

The SOS signal is not sent as three separate characters; rather, it is a prosign sos, and is keyed without gaps between characters
[03:33:45] <gwern> and the blog as a whole is the same thing since it's a collection
[03:34:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Good luck rendering this as a linkicon
[03:34:38] <gwern> I might as well just put 'SOS'

[03:51:11] <Betawolf> the population of people who've looked at the favicon can't be huge
[03:53:04] <gwern> Betawolf: true but if you look at it at all, you have to go, 'what's going on with the edges'. I actually thought it was going to be some sort of really shitty safe or lockbox drawing unrecognizable in a favicon
[03:53:29] <gwern> "he's got a combo lock on the homepage, he's a security guy who protects things, yeah, that would make sense, and no one's ever accused him of esthetics"

[03:54:45] <gwern> but we're hackers! we look for easter eggs
[03:56:55] <saturn2> gwern: the guy is a cryptographer after all, he's probably quite pleased that no one understands his favicon
[03:57:12] <gwern> it's also a pretty big favicon. wonder if there's anything steganographic in it
[03:57:18] <gwern> 32k
[03:57:42] <gwern> (optipngs down to 16k, but that doesn't necessarily tell you anything)
[03:58:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... 32k?!
[03:58:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf
[03:59:24] <gwern> suspicious eh
[03:59:52] <gwern> (sadly when you finally crack it, it's just a message reminding you to drink your ovaltine protein shake)
[04:00:12] <Betawolf> Mine is just 4.29kb
[04:00:22] <adiabatic> he probably just had the settings for an apple touch icon or whatever and didn't give a shit to squish it further
[04:00:31] <adiabatic> besides, computers only ever get more pixels to throw at this
[04:00:35] <kuudes> ah, indeed. this is a good time for russian men abroad to claim they would get conscripted?
[04:00:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> My favicon is...
[04:00:54] <Betawolf> I mean, the one I see from SOS
[04:01:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> 17k, I guess. Hm. I bet that could be optimized
[04:01:10] <gurkenglas> i just staked M$ 100 on https://manifold.markets/6cde/will-1-usd-be-worth-at-least-100-ru to bring it 28%->47%, why do you think the ruble crashes on monday?

[04:01:32] <adiabatic> I have SVG, webp, and PNG favicons, so I assume they're all different sizes
[04:01:36] <kuudes> it has already, gurkenglas
[04:01:43] <gwern> Betawolf: I downloaded what looked like the largest one, the pressablecdn.com cropped-favicon-1-270x270.png
[04:01:51] <kuudes> currently inside russia exchange rate is 150:1 or so
[04:02:12] <gwern> brutal. their PPP is collapsing. I wonder how internal exchange will hold up
[04:02:34] <Betawolf> Ah, there are alternates. The one I got was 192x192
[04:02:58] <kuudes> I think it will be an iceland moment and money will just lose value but perhaps internally
[04:03:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm, I guess it does have a drop shadow and feathering and stuff. Maybe 17k is as good as it gets
[04:05:37] <gurkenglas> kuudes: oh i see, perhaps the russian central bank's "83.5 rubles per dollar" is just false. but then they published that on Feb 26th. Can you recommend some more real-time data?
[04:06:07] <kuudes> today is sunday
[04:06:11] <kuudes> so there is no exchange
[04:06:20] <kuudes> that is why the econ explosion was done by weekend
[04:06:35] <kuudes> so that putin had this weekend to decide if we wanted to accept it or not
[04:06:50] <kuudes> if he had folded, they would have released the money and nothing would have happened
[04:06:53] <gurkenglas> surely you can go to some tourist shop in moscow and exchange at some rate
[04:07:18] <kuudes> the places that have not run out are at around 150:1 to sell rubles and 80:1 to buy rubles with usd
[04:07:38] <kuudes> I don't know what is the current situation, this was some hours ago
[04:07:40] <gurkenglas> sounds like they're making a profit on the panic, then!
[04:08:02] <kuudes> well, when they run out of usd bills, they run out of usd bills
[04:08:11] <gurkenglas> there are other currencies
[04:08:25] <kuudes> yes, which have the same situation
[04:08:42] <kuudes> because it is not usd and eur getting more value but ruble losing it
[04:09:07] <kuudes> russians from thailand second hand reported that their cards have stopped working and hotels have stopped accepting rubles there
[04:09:41] <gurkenglas> if the bills are simply running out, then the 150 is not that much evidence of 150 tomorrow
[04:09:56] <kuudes> yes, it will be worse tomorrow
[04:10:22] <kuudes> mind you that they can't get new bills into the country
[04:10:25] <gurkenglas> a lot of my resistance to this comes from the USDRUB symbol going up less than you'd think given the information they had https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDRUB/
[04:10:26] <kuudes> because of sanctions
[04:10:26] <Robomot> USD RUB Chart - Dollar Ruble Rate — TradingView (View live U.S. Dollar / Russian Ruble chart to track latest price changes. Trade ideas, forecasts and market news are at your disposal as well.)
[04:10:48] <kuudes> xe.com still has horizontal line because it is sunday
[04:10:57] <gurkenglas> or is the idea that they saw this coming years ago and the ruble would have improved a lot if putin folded
[04:11:38] <gwern> if you were a ruble trader, how would you *not* price in "something goes horribly wrong"? everyone knows about LTCM
[04:11:41] <kuudes> if putin had folded and west had rolled back the sanctions, rate on monday would be 80
[04:11:56] <gwern> not to mention this war has been building very visibly for a long time, even discounting the original 2014 separatism
[04:12:01] <kuudes> because then ecb and fed and russian central bank would say the rate is 80
[04:12:05] <gurkenglas> kuudes: therefore rate on friday should have been wayyy above 80
[04:12:11] <kuudes> and if they all agree, they can say what the rate is
[04:12:16] <kuudes> and none of us others have no say
[04:12:18] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:12:22] <kuudes> because each of them have a printing press
[04:12:42] <kuudes> you can't bet against central bank that is healthy. you will lose
[04:12:49] <gurkenglas> and yet
[04:13:00] <kuudes> russian central bank is not healthy anymore
[04:13:09] <gurkenglas> on friday if the rate was 80 then every ruble in circulation would have become a dollar
[04:13:25] <gurkenglas> under that state of information and printing presses
[04:13:50] <kuudes> iirc ruble dropped in thursday when conflict escalated
[04:14:06] <kuudes> but russian central bank and state ordered trusted actors to buy rubles with dollars
[04:14:14] <kuudes> so the rate was maintained
[04:14:26] <kuudes> and putin had reserved 600 bn$ for this
[04:14:39] <kuudes> but on saturday, 500 bn$ of that 600 bn$ was yoinked
[04:14:53] <kuudes> and now we are here
[04:15:11] <gurkenglas> sounds like switzerland and ycombinator should be staking half of all the billions they have against that speculation.
[04:15:23] <kuudes> why?
[04:15:38] <gurkenglas> -speculation+distortion
[04:15:51] <kuudes> switzerland is pondering on if they join the sanction and steal the russian money in there
[04:16:24] <kuudes> and if you are a western person or company and want to speculate pro putin, I guess you might get a call from us state department
[04:16:32] <kuudes> or just the fbi
[04:16:53] <gurkenglas> because if they can sell 80 rubles for a dollar today and then buy back 50/50 either 120 or 80 tomorrow that is an expected 25% rate of return over 3 days
[04:17:15] <gurkenglas> -today+friday
[04:17:15] <kuudes> no one can sell 80 rubles for dollar currently
[04:17:34] <gurkenglas> friday. are you saying the current situation wasnt forseeable friday?
[04:17:35] <kuudes> well if you knew putin would not yield, sure
[04:17:45] <gurkenglas> not "knew", estimated 50% chance.
[04:17:54] <kuudes> if you had that information, sure
[04:18:28] <kuudes> mind you that putin might have been interested of your gamble as well
[04:18:39] <kuudes> and if you were a wrong person, maybe you would get gravity
[04:19:00] <gurkenglas> Rather, if I stake too much against him he folds and cashes in.
[04:19:14] <kuudes> if you are a small fish and really really smart, you can indeed gain stuff or burn your fingers. if you are too big, you get into prison or a bullet
[04:19:34] <kuudes> small persons can gamble with this. big persons are part of one side already
[04:20:11] <kuudes> bill gates can't gamble against us state department, and it feels unwise for him to gamble against putin, if putin would hold a grudge against him
[04:20:20] <gurkenglas> i dont expect random wolves on wolf street to eat bullet for picking up dollar bills. not least because it'd be the entire forest.
[04:20:20] <kuudes> or well, you can ask soros how nice things are
[04:20:38] <kuudes> well yes. they are tools for us state department in this case
[04:20:52] <kuudes> and russian central bank might have something in its arsenal
[04:21:13] <gurkenglas> What % do you put on >100 tomorrow?

[16:50:03] <PapuaHardyNet> the dual of "printed repr" and "read syntax" of lisp is very interesting. no other language family I know of has this (albeit limited) ability to be able to *read* objects like tickers into a symbol. I assume this is what allows lisp to create macros
[16:50:19] <feep[work]> what do you mean, objects like tickers?
[16:50:36] <feep[work]> I don't think the *serialization* capability is that important
[16:51:02] <PapuaHardyNet> uhh, what do you call those punched papers that used to be fed into old computers
[16:51:08] <feep[work]> punchcards
[16:51:23] <PapuaHardyNet> well all right, that's what I meant
[16:51:31] <feep[work]> at any rate, I don't think that's central
[16:51:57] <feep[work]> it's more about the fact that the language only has one data structure, which is also its single syntax construct
[16:53:00] <PapuaHardyNet> are you referring to symbols as the main data structure here?
[16:53:08] <feep[work]> no, lists :P
[16:53:14] <feep[work]> (a b c)

[16:53:33] <PapuaHardyNet> integers aren't a list though, and we have primitives that are integers
[16:53:49] <feep[work]> okay yes technically there's different leaf types
[16:54:28] <feep[work]> but I think the power of lisp for metaprogramming derives from the fact that all its tools are bent towards manipulating the one thing that it is also written in.
[16:54:39] <feep[work]> it is enormously, relentlessly, focused.
[16:54:56] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I think that makes sense.
[16:55:24] <PapuaHardyNet> how would you replace the serialization though? I think serialization is a "necessary but not sufficient" feature for this to happen
[16:55:32] <feep[work]> I think it's not at all necessary
[16:55:51] <PapuaHardyNet> (you write code in text, you read the textual representation of code as string and decompose it)
[16:55:56] <feep[work]> this might be a misunderstanding of lisp, lisp doesn't serialize lists to syntax, rather, the code you type in *starts its life as lists*.
[16:56:17] <feep[work]> or I'm misunderstanding what you mean.
[16:56:55] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. I mean, you send a textual buffer stream into the read function, and that outputs an object
[16:57:13] <feep[work]> yeah
[16:57:23] <PapuaHardyNet> that's what I believed you meant wasn't necessary
[16:57:34] <feep[work]> oh, serialization is structure to text
[16:57:36] <PapuaHardyNet> the reading and writing of buffer streams that can contain code itself
[16:57:50] <feep[work]> you mean parsing, which is to say deserialization
[16:58:32] <feep[work]> the meaning is that serialization takes a structured object laid out as a tree or graph in memory and translates it into a continuous, serial, sequence of characters/bytes
[16:58:42] <PapuaHardyNet> huh, I see. I'm using the words wrongly. but are deserialization and serialization unnecessary for metaprogramming? if so, what can you replace them with
[16:58:51] <feep[work]> well, parsing is necessary for all programming
[16:59:01] <feep[work]> not particularly for metaprogramming
[16:59:07] <PapuaHardyNet> hahah yeah
[16:59:14] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: anyway, the key insight of lisp is that 
[16:59:18] <feep[work]> 14:26 < PapuaHardyNet> huh. I mean, you send a textual buffer stream into the read function, and that outputs an object
[16:59:24] <feep[work]> the object *is a list*. it's just a list.
[16:59:37] <gurkenglas> mjr, ...what does blocking passanger flights have to do with economic sanctions
[17:00:12] <PapuaHardyNet> right. which means objects read are treated the same as code being already run, which enables metaprogramming
[17:00:28] <feep[work]> sortaish.
[17:00:47] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I think maybe if you're coming from C or something, the way that my compiler does metaprogramming may be easier to understand
[17:01:11] <feep[work]> because while it's way more complicated than lisp metaprogramming, it shares core ideas, and the types involved may make the structure of the transformations more visible
[17:01:21] <feep[work]> alternately, write a lisp interpreter, it's not hard, and it's a good way to learn how macros work
[17:01:37] <feep[work]> actually, on reflection, this is way easier to understand that way
[17:01:45] <feep[work]> so let me explain how lisp evaluation actually works
[17:02:01] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: okay, so you have (lambda ((a) (+ a b)))
[17:02:07] <feep[work]> er, (a b)
[17:02:14] <feep[work]> or hm
[17:02:28] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: okay, so you have (defun add (a b) (+ a b))
[17:02:31] <feep[work]> syntax made up obv
[17:02:45] <PapuaHardyNet> sure that syntax probably works
[17:03:11] <feep[work]> what happens when that is called with say, a is 5, b is 6, those are both put in a linked list (ie. a list, lol)
[17:03:20] <PapuaHardyNet> (it is legit elisp syntax btw)
[17:03:28] <feep[work]> ie. there's a stack of variable bindings, the top of which is now (a 5) (b 6)
[17:03:41] <feep[work]> then (+ a b) is just chucked in the evaluator
[17:03:50] <feep[work]> what happens is, the evaluator evaluates *every element of the list*
[17:04:02] <feep[work]> + becomes :+ or sym_plus or whatever interna there is for addition
[17:04:10] <feep[work]> a becomes 5
[17:04:12] <feep[work]> b becomes 6
[17:04:21] <feep[work]> then (sym_plus 5 6) is actually called
[17:04:25] <feep[work]> and the whole thing evaluates to 11.
[17:04:51] <feep[work]> this is important! when you call a list, every element of the list is evaluated. this is eager evaluation.
[17:05:08] <feep[work]> now assume we (defmacro add (a b) (+ a b))
[17:05:25] <feep[work]> what happens here is subtly different, in a way that means it probably won't work
[17:06:08] <feep[work]> namely, when you (add 5 6), what you get back is (+ 5 6). *not* 11.
[17:06:24] <feep[work]> ie. for instance when you (add x y), you would get back (+ x y). the x and y have *not* been evaluated.
[17:06:38] <feep[work]> macro evocation does not evaluate the arguments first!
[17:07:01] <feep[work]> so when you do (add (+ 2 3) 4), then the add function would actually get, bound to a, '(+ 2 3)!
[17:07:12] <feep[work]> but this is not a special affordance of serialization or deserialization
[17:07:26] <feep[work]> it is that the lisp core loop *skipped the step* where it would *normally* have turned (+ 2 3) into 5 *first*.
[17:07:36] <feep[work]> macro invocation is an act of doing *less* than normal, not more.
[17:08:05] <PapuaHardyNet> so lazy evaluation is the key to macros and meta programming? if so, does that mean that haskell is *the* language for metaprogramming
[17:08:14] <feep[work]> it's not *just* lazy evaluation
[17:08:17] <synthmeat> what makes lisp particularly pliable for metaprog is that syntax is very close to ast and lang is simple
[17:08:32] <feep[work]> it's lazy evaluation on a *single shared datastructure* with a rich set of tools for manipulating it.
[17:08:54] <feep[work]> and actually, it's not even lazy evaluation
[17:09:19] <feep[work]> it's *non*-evaluation, it's the fact that what is passed is the *pre-evaluation* data structure. this is not inherent in lazy evaluation.
[17:09:58] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: for instance, in neat, to simplify things enormously, let's say there's a class AST { } that all AST types are derived of
[17:10:14] <feep[work]> when you would write a function int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
[17:10:25] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: for shame: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16244980999526652229&hl=en&as_sdt=0,21
[17:10:25] <Robomot> Google Scholar
[17:10:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. lazy evaluation actually involves a promise to evaluate, but here we are actually sending a list `(+ 2 3) instead of making any promise to evaluate
[17:10:39] <feep[work]> the macro equivalent would be AST add(AST a, AST b) { return AST("+", a, b); }
[17:10:53] <feep[work]> yep, though you *could* evaluate if you wanted
[17:11:21] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: the huge difference is that I can do shit like
[17:11:47] <gwern> capisce: don't need to worry about inflation or rubles if you don't have a world with russians /points to head
[17:11:50] <feep[work]> AST add(AST a, AST b) { if (auto amul = a.instanceOf(ASTMul)) { /* do special handling for add(2*3, 4); */ } }
[17:12:07] <feep[work]> see? because what's passed is *just the syntax itself*.
[17:12:14] <feep[work]> I can introspect and interpret that syntax as I please.
[17:12:17] <feep[work]> and that's the real power.
[17:12:37] <PapuaHardyNet> right, right. In lisp that could be basically (eq `* (car a)) as a condition

[17:13:46] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet, I now get it. You aren't simply "replacing code" as you do in C's limited macro support, you can introspect and inspect the code passed to you and decide based on that. I get it now
[17:13:53] <feep[work]> yepyep :)
[17:14:04] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: now, the hilarious thing is, because neat is a compiled language, I *do* actually need serialization.
[17:14:36] <feep[work]> cause the macros can do things like ... return $expr ($a + $b); which will *compile* to return ASTAdd("+", a, b);
[17:14:56] <feep[work]> but that's just cause my IR format and my AST tree are separate.
[17:15:18] <feep[work]> and there's a layer of separation due to the compiled and macro code running in different namespaces.
[17:15:21] <feep[work]> but lisp shares one memory.
[17:15:48] <feep[work]> if my macros shared memory with the compiled code, I could just use the compiler object itself, by value.
[17:15:52] <PapuaHardyNet> makes sense, yeah. so zero evaluation + shared memory
[17:15:53] <feep[work]> which (interpreted) lisp does.
[17:15:59] <gwern> compilers were a mistake
[17:17:10] <feep[work]> if I evaluated AST nodes instead of compiling them, I could just evaluate the AST node returned by the macro directly.
[17:17:13] <feep[work]> life could be so good~~~

[17:18:26] <feep[work]> I've been pondering for a long time if there was a way to automatically jam objects into the backend, maybe something with introspection. I'd need something like an "unconstructor"
[17:18:47] <feep[work]> (not a destructor!)
[17:18:50] <feep[work]> (a way to take an object and return a tuple of values to be passed to the constructor to produce the same object.)
[17:19:12] <kuudes> capisce, thanks
