[04:03:10] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Hey @ElegantBeef, you've helped me deal with some cyclic dependency issues before. I'm hoping you can help me again, if you have a minute :)‚ÜµI'd like to add a new ObjectType here, where the Obj variant has a Chunk field, where Chunk is defined in chunk.nim https://github.com/mattrberry/crim-lox/blob/master/nlox/src/nlox/value.nim#L14-L19‚ÜµSince chunk.nim already depends on value.nim, it seems like I can't get this to work
[04:03:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'll help in a few minutes
[04:03:44] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Tyvm :)
[04:07:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Move the object type down and the value stuff ub then put a `import chunk` above the object type stuff
[04:07:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It might work, though looks like it may not
[04:07:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah nvm it's not going to
[04:08:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Perhaps a `Obj[T]` then instantiate it with `Chunk`?
[04:08:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I dont know this is an odd structure to get around
[04:11:15] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Yeah I think I tried that since that's what worked last time, but it doesn't seem to be working here :/
[04:11:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well this is cyclical in a typedefinition and also across a module
[04:12:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So `Obj` has to be declared with or above `Value` but Obj has to appear after Value so you can import Value from Chunk and import Chunk for Obj
[04:12:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So a generic might be the way around this, or put them all together
[04:14:31] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> I was able to get it working with a separate `types.nim` file like I've done before, but I was hoping to avoid that :/
[04:14:44] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> I'm guessing that's going to be the least hacky way though
[04:16:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean generic isnt that hacky üòõ
[04:17:03] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Not too hacky, but requires some extra contextual overhead wherever I instantiate Obj
[04:17:06] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Right?
[04:17:48] <FromDiscord> <mattrb> Compared to just throwing it in a types.nim, which will require an additional import and will further separate the data from the operations on it which I don't love, but that's it
