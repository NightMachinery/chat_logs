[12:30:31] <riv> i can't even type correctly on mine
[12:30:45] <pretty_dumm_guy> besides i prefer to have ability to side-load apps. Apple doesnt allow that as far as I know
[12:30:55] <epilys> riv, yeah. tell a random kid who's on the smartphone all day to use a computer and they can't (not that using Microsoft Windows is necessarily computer literacy
[12:31:25] <epilys> pretty_dumm_guy, are you a tinkerer? if yes get a pinephone
[12:31:42] <pretty_dumm_guy> riv: you should look up moto g100. They have a docking station feature which lets you connect your phone to a display.
[12:32:13] <pretty_dumm_guy> your phone turns into a computer basically. pretty amazing
[12:32:18] <riv> oooooh
[12:32:23] <gerikson> epilys: I deffo feel that using a desktop OS is becoming a minority thing, fast

[12:32:44] <pretty_dumm_guy> epilys: ah yeah I haven't thought about that one at all. is it available in europe ?
[12:32:48] <iDrougge> pretty_dumm_guy: What new features?
[12:32:57] <epilys> pretty_dumm_guy, I think so
[12:33:09] <epilys> wink, I'm a millenial
[12:33:21] <epilys> I wish I was a boomer, I'd have a job
[12:33:28] <pretty_dumm_guy> iDrougge: CSAM detection feature. Though its only for US phones, it doesnt take long for them to turn it on for europe
[12:33:30] <wink> epilys: yeah, suggesting a windows PC gave it away that you're too old
[12:33:35] <iDrougge> CSAM?
[12:33:49] <wink> but I agree, phones are weird. and games on phones are extra weird
[12:33:50] <pretty_dumm_guy> child sexual abuse material

[12:35:14] <epilys> wink, didn't mention minecraft
[12:35:29] <wink> epilys: yeah I see that now, sorry :D
[12:35:33] <wink> I misread microsoft
[12:35:40] * wink ducks into editor in shame
[12:35:40] <epilys> haha one and the same isn't it
[12:35:50] <epilys> btw I bought minecraft for 10-15 euros when it was still alpha/beta

[12:36:24] <wink> but still I think it's weird. our parent generation didn't grasp computers and our children generation only uses phones
[12:37:02] <epilys> maybe that's why there's a "lack" of new software devs?
[12:37:09] <riv> woah
[12:37:18] <riv> we're the only computer people
[12:37:39] <epilys> some of us hit that sweet spot where desktop computers were a thing
[12:38:26] <pretty_dumm_guy> cool even pinephone seems to have digital video output feature.
[12:40:12] <epilys> get a thinclient and this: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
[12:40:13] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - Genymobile/scrcpy: Display and control your Android device ] - github.com
[12:41:06] <epilys> that's how I use my phone when I'm not out (can't prefer touchscreen over thinkpad keyboard)
[12:41:29] <pretty_dumm_guy> oh this is awesome
[12:41:55] <epilys> it doesn't support non-ascii input though
[12:42:34] <epilys> I wrote a mini tkinter program to type stuff and then sync it with the phone's clipboard and then paste it in the phone
[12:42:36] <gerikson> that looks really cool

[13:48:53] <kline> messages will probably be something like this
[13:49:37] <kline> probably should just be a normal signature rather than a hmac but still
[13:50:20] <kline> i just want to avoid making dumb mistakes around the semantics rather than the way its written
[13:50:45] <kline> things like how to avoid messages being sent around in loops if peers are allowed to forward messages on
[13:51:07] <thardin> you could look at how briar solves that

[13:53:15] <riv> you could use a TTL counter
[13:53:47] <kline> riv, i thought that too, but then how do you do that while preserving the signature?
[13:53:55] <kline> or else a bad node could just keep resetting it to 255
[13:54:52] <thardin> append signed TTL-- messages?
[13:55:08] <thardin> that chain to eachother in some way
[13:55:10] <kline> i have a vague feeling this will end up being very whitelisted, where you end up just whitelisting specific peers
[13:56:04] <epilys> i recall reading about this in network class
[13:56:19] <epilys> there's the spanning tree protocol which prevents loops by mapping a tree of the network
[13:57:29] <riv> I suppose a bad node could always send stuff, so maybe it's not a big problem

[18:40:16] <amirouche> > We have been working on making high quality standalone releases of WiredTiger again for a while now. This 10.0.0 release of WiredTiger is a stepping stone towards achieving that goal.

[18:40:38] <amirouche> the previous release was 3.2.1
[18:40:45] <amirouche> exciting times.
[18:42:11] <c355e3b> Does this mean we may be able to use a different frontend on top of the thing?
[18:42:17] <c355e3b> like plug it into mysql and really go for it?
[18:42:34] <amirouche> the most interesting to me is they removed the "rebalance" function.
[18:42:51] <amirouche> c355e3b: it used to be the case, but the backend for mysql was not maintained.
[18:42:57] <c355e3b> hmm
[18:43:19] <c355e3b> Acutaly, I think a clickhouse driver could be really interesting
[18:44:08] <amirouche> I keep trying to argue that the value of such database is that it allows to solve many problem; tho, i understand the need for a ready-to-use frontend.
[18:44:51] <c355e3b> I'm with you on that, but the problem is there is a *ton* of fear in the industry around databases
[18:45:09] <c355e3b> Like I've been trying to get foundationdb into projects every since it got open sorucesd
[18:45:11] <c355e3b> *sourced
[18:45:17] <amirouche> oh really?
[18:45:19] <amirouche> :)
[18:45:23] <c355e3b> tons of fud around just looking at the thing
[18:45:26] <c355e3b> which pisses me off
[18:45:33] <amirouche> fud like what?
[18:46:11] <amirouche> foundationdb is _the_ good kid; compared to other databases, I mean they come with their own test suite aka. the simulation.
[18:46:17] <c355e3b> operating at scale is to complex, we can't do reporting off of it, its too expensive
[18:46:37] <c355e3b> the only complaint that I feel holds water is that its hard to hire ops people with foundation db experience
[18:46:40] <amirouche> was is the legacy system using? a managed database?
[18:46:52] <amirouche> s/was/what/
[18:46:52] <c355e3b> aws rds postgres
[18:46:56] <amirouche> yeah sure
[18:46:59] <amirouche> then it makes sens.
[18:47:19] <c355e3b> but like, they made some eav nightmare to allow customers to have their own columns
[18:47:37] <amirouche> oh no /o\
[18:48:18] <amirouche> I also argue to quit aws; without aws, and without managed services, foundationdb becomes more interesting.
[18:49:10] <c355e3b> I think the hardest part about dropping AWS is the fact that auditors gloss over everything AWS related when you need to get your SOC/PCI/DSS cert
[18:49:22] <amirouche> also the "horror stories" about operating distributed at scale, do not necessarly apply to foundationdb, also do you need scale; the top poster on the latest HN story says foundationdb ops are very neat.
[18:49:36] <amirouche> and apparantly they do it at scale.
[18:49:41] <amirouche> some scale.
[18:50:00] <amirouche> gloss over? Mean like AWS is a requirement?
[18:50:28] <c355e3b> Yeah
[18:50:32] <c355e3b> if you say, we are in AWS
[18:50:43] <c355e3b> you do a tenth of the work versus another cloud or a datacenter
[18:50:51] <amirouche> meh
[18:51:16] <c355e3b> having done these audits before, that's huge
[18:51:28] <c355e3b> the amount of blood they got out of us over PCI was insane
[18:51:47] <amirouche> meh = I mean what advantage has AWS about security at the infrastructure level?
[18:52:22] <amirouche> (I am not into certification at this time)
[18:52:35] <c355e3b> Generally nothing, but its "known"
[18:52:54] <c355e3b> So compare saying We are in AWS vs we are in savvis
[18:53:16] <amirouche> I get it.
[18:53:44] <c355e3b> So that's (for me) the big sticking factor

[18:54:13] <c355e3b> I wonder though if it would get better if there was a eaiser way to think about non-aws solutions
[18:54:57] <amirouche> it is unlikely AWS will provide a foundationdb cluster for the time being; they have a competitor database dynamodb.
[18:55:27] <amirouche> The price is huge factor for my personal project.
[18:55:58] <amirouche> AWS is very pricey. You get away with free tier and credits, but apple-to-apple comparison show a vast amount of wasted money.
[18:56:35] <c355e3b> I've looked at doing a splunk competitor once, it was something like a 90% cost reduction running everything out of a datacenter or even digitalocean vs aws

[23:13:13] <pja> Amazon doesn’t seem to have anything more recent than Cascade Lake from Intel, if their web pages are to be believed.
[23:13:22] <pja> (or else I can’t find any anyway)
[23:14:14] <companion_cube> don't they also have ARM stuff?

[23:26:03] <c355e3b> yeah they have a custom arm chip
[23:27:52] <companion_cube> graviton?
[23:28:18] <c355e3b> yep
[23:28:29] <c355e3b> and if you are on ibm cloud, you can get ppc
[23:29:17] <pja> Graviton is not particular quick. No where near M1 speeds IIRC.
[23:29:26] <pja> In power density terms it’s pretty good tho.
[23:29:49] <companion_cube> I wonder, what's the appeal of ARM in the cloud anyway?
[23:30:03] <companion_cube> power density sounds like it matters to the cloud provider, not customers
[23:30:20] <c355e3b> it end up being super cheap
[23:31:25] <companion_cube> ah, I see, they do reflect the savings?
[23:31:50] <c355e3b> yeah
[23:32:54] <c355e3b> 70 cents an hour for an x86 vs 20 cents for the arm version
[23:33:27] <companion_cube> wow indeed.
[23:37:20] <c355e3b> now I mean there are tons of other factors involved in that
[23:37:28] <c355e3b> but umm, if you can pull it its worth it
[23:37:53] <c355e3b> some "real world" numbers from work https://www.instana.com/blog/best-practices-for-analyzing-the-performance-of-php-on-aws-graviton-2/
