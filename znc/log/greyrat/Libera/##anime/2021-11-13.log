[00:14:07] <Bco1981> verdict, if you want to play a bit of games, go with AMD APU's, if gaming isn't what you do you are best of with a cheap intel.
[00:14:38] <TsundereNoises> I feel like I vaguely miss video games, but I don't know if that's just a passing fancy
[00:14:51] <emmeka> yeah from what I could tell the 5700G actually has really good onboard graphics, good enough to get decent fps on medium-low graphics in most games
[00:14:54] <TsundereNoises> I've basically never had a chance to play video games as an adult, between tech reasons and life reasons

[02:08:24] <Roey> <MootPoot> My phone is making my ass stretch  <- what I read at first glance, to which I was about to answer that perhaps using a dedicated vibrator, rather than a cell phone, would provide a better "stretching" experience.
[02:22:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That is legitimate advise.
[02:22:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *advice
[02:23:39] <MootPoot> this capture card is shit
[02:23:44] <MootPoot> it says 1080p60
[02:23:49] <MootPoot> cant actually do 1080p60
[02:25:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: False advertising?
[02:25:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: If they're in the same country as you, report them to your bureau of trade if you want.
[02:26:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If they're not it's usually cheaper to just return it
[02:26:42] <MootPoot> well
[02:26:47] <MootPoot> amazon, but chinese
[02:26:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Return it
[02:26:55] <MootPoot> it CAN do 1080p60
[02:26:56] <MootPoot> technically
[02:27:01] <MootPoot> it just cant hold it
[02:27:13] <MootPoot> without the screen blacking out when there's too much info or something
[02:27:26] <MootPoot> and only the top half being properly recorded
[02:27:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That means it can't reasonbly to do it. Cars are rated for their expected performance, not for what they can do right before the engine catches fire.

[02:30:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's a proper term in electrical and mechanical engineering for the idea, but I don't remember it
[02:30:30] <Poeticode> damn that sucks :(

[02:31:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah, it's like power cables. 2kw wire can take 2.5~4kw for a moment.

[06:20:13] <Sadale> KingKeA, how's aeres?
[06:20:29] <KingKeA> Hello Sadale!
[06:21:02] <KingKeA> It appears that you've guys have changed IRC servers, I didn't realize because I mostly idle
[06:21:07] <KingKeA> but enjoy the conversation at times by fellow geeks.
[06:22:20] <amigojapan> KingKeA: several people were lost in the move
[06:22:45] <KingKeA> oh my goodness I was just thinking about you.
[06:22:58] <amigojapan> We lost gennji :( one of our few Japanese users
[06:22:59] <KingKeA> the guy who is totally okay with taking time out of his day to teach you programming or japanese. 
[06:23:19] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: Korean prince issues...
[06:23:36] <amigojapan> KingKeA: programming I am happy to teach
[06:23:56] <amigojapan> Japanese too I guess
[06:24:06] <KingKeA> you guys are pretty cool for some internet strangers i'd say.
[06:24:17] <KingKeA> think i've been idealing here a few years.
[06:24:22] <KingKeA> *idling. 
[06:24:59] <KingKeA> so.... windows 11, what cha think?
[06:25:37] <amigojapan> KingKeA: it's good to know that some of the idlers are lurkers and not bots to record everything we say
[06:25:45] <amigojapan> Log bots
[06:25:54] <KingKeA> are we important enough to have log bots?
[06:26:06] <amigojapan> Dunno
[06:26:06] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: sticking with Linux :P
[06:26:10] <Sadale> freenode take over was probably the dumbest takeover on the IRC history.
[06:26:41] <KingKeA> don't hate me Urchin[emacs]! I found linux really challenging for simple task.

[06:26:58] <KingKeA> yeah so freenode is dead forever? I suppose it's old news now, but again didn't realize until I tried to visit here.

[06:27:48] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: I find people fail to explain how to ease in with Linux
[06:28:06] <amigojapan> KingKeA: yeah I am not going back to freenode
[06:28:25] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: best thing I found was a list of equivalent software on linux to stuff commonly used on Windows back in the day
[06:28:31] <Sadale> KingKeA, Technically freenode may not be dead. But it's now very difficult to join freenode and I'm not even sure if it's possible to join it anymore. And most users and I just don't bother to check that.
[06:28:36] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: and I started with KUbuntu
[06:28:50] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: KDE is good when it comes to familiarity to Windows users
[06:28:55] <Sadale> It's not the freenode that we've known of. Libera has pretty much replaced the old freenode.
[06:29:27] <Urchin[emacs]> KingKeA: but I've abandoned that since, now I'm not using any desktop environment, just a raw tiling window manager
[06:29:32] <KingKeA> Urchin[emacs] well, tbh it seemed really fragile too. things that I took for granted, like running some displays on onboard graphics and some on dedicated graphics being such a gargantuan task in linux was dead simple in windows. 
[06:30:54] <Sadale> Window's better if you just want shit to work out of the box.
[06:31:08] <Sadale> When it breaks tho you may have to reinstall.
[06:31:29] <Sadale> As for linux, it's difficult to get it work. But it's highly customizable. However, you can't play most of the games on it
[06:31:44] <KingKeA> so whats the advantage? efficiency? low footprint?
[06:31:44] <Urchin[emacs]> indeed
[06:31:59] <Urchin[emacs]> I've stopped gaming, so I'm fine with that
[06:32:03] <Urchin[emacs]> well
[06:32:10] <Urchin[emacs]> there's enough games to keep me interested
[06:32:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Pillars of Eternity, BATTLETECH
[06:33:04] <Urchin[emacs]> Stardew Valley
[06:33:10] <Sadale> To me it's mainly because it's highly customizable. And I'm more used to using linux. For average user, it doesn't really have much advantages.
[06:33:55] <Urchin[emacs]> A Kiss For The Petals Remembering How We Met <- some obligatory yuri vn
[06:33:56] <Sadale> And in linux, I could just type in commands to do whatever I want. It can be argued that Windows could do the same with PowerShell tho. But I don't know shit aobut PowerShell. So linux it is then :P
[06:34:32] <Urchin[emacs]> eh, tried PowerShell once, back when it first came out, took it about a minute and a half to start
[06:35:03] <Sadale> wow
[06:35:06] <Sadale> That's woe
[06:35:17] <Urchin[emacs]> that was back on Windows XP, though
[06:35:36] <Sadale> oh wait
[06:35:43] <Sadale> Since when there's PowerShell on Windows XP?
[06:35:50] <Sadale> I thought that it was introduced on Vista or 7
[06:36:23] <Urchin[emacs]> it came out in 2006 and it had a Windows version
[06:36:32] <Urchin[emacs]> I may have downloaded it at the time or something
[06:36:33] <Sadale> aw speaking of games. I wonder if modern computer can emulate Windows XP without any framedrop. Like running it into virtual machine

[12:01:38] <MootPoot> I will make you join the cz club one day butter
[12:01:55] <ButterNoodle> and I got to see what the short reset trigger disconnector looks like..
[12:02:06] <ButterNoodle> I was confused
[12:02:07] <MootPoot> My cz that I got for 850 is now going for 1100
[12:02:15] <MootPoot> The pricing these days
[12:02:16] <ButterNoodle> everything is crazy
[12:02:26] <ButterNoodle> I'll add a cz

[12:04:15] <ButterNoodle> yes
[12:04:17] <MootPoot> OCHINCHIN POWER
[12:04:37] <MootPoot> IKUUUUUUUUUUU KYA~
[12:04:41] <ButterNoodle> my big concern is they have stopped production of so many models/variants
[12:04:49] <ButterNoodle> so now or never..
[12:05:00] <MootPoot> Did they
[12:05:07] <ButterNoodle> a lot
[12:05:07] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: stripped-back production economy
[12:05:17] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: bare-back production
[12:05:17] <MootPoot> I haven't kept up with pew pew news
[12:05:25] <DunceCotus> capitalism is a relentless engine
[12:05:34] <ButterNoodle> its not an industry issue its a company issue
[12:05:36] <MootPoot> Spending all my money on student loans
[12:05:41] <DunceCotus> so if its on full blast you can do a lot of 'good' and also a lot of damage
[12:05:43] <ButterNoodle> I seen ur budget
[12:05:58] <ButterNoodle> u paying over?
[12:06:11] <ButterNoodle> like triple payments on ur student loans?
[12:06:30] <DunceCotus> when market is very complex and 'free', its more chaotic and this chaos threatens the power of the financial and political institutions  etc.
[12:06:41] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: words
[12:07:15] <DunceCotus> however the free market brings on this state of chaos that needs to be rei[g]ned in by way of market regulators, state, "internally socialist" corporations etc.
[12:07:16] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: more like 10x over
[12:07:24] <ButterNoodle> nice
[12:07:31] <ButterNoodle> dont need that hanging over ur head
[12:07:39] <ButterNoodle> its a real cock sucker when u get old
[12:07:42] <ButterNoodle> and have bills
[12:08:07] <MootPoot> I could either waste my money on rent
[12:08:11] <DunceCotus> we only have bills because our basic needs are commodified
[12:08:15] <MootPoot> Or pay back loan at least
[12:08:29] <ButterNoodle> yea thats a good plan
[12:08:38] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: more words
[12:08:52] <ButterNoodle> shit
[12:09:07] <DunceCotus> we fall into debt over our disposable shaving blades or a spotify subscription
[12:09:08] <ButterNoodle> speaking of basic needs.. I was gonna order a new remote controlled vibrating butt plug
[12:09:16] <MootPoot> I have ~6k to pay back
[12:09:18] <ButterNoodle> and forgot
[12:09:29] <ButterNoodle> I think I have 20 or 30
[12:09:40] <ButterNoodle> cant remember
[12:09:47] <DunceCotus> we fall into debt over being in debt
[12:09:54] <DunceCotus> the debt-lock
[12:10:43] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: what are we gonna do but trust the Conglomerate
[12:11:14] <ButterNoodle> I dont
[12:11:19] <ButterNoodle> I just pay shit off
[12:11:21] <DunceCotus> you may think you don't
[12:11:30] <ButterNoodle> and write off interest on my taxes
[12:11:38] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: that you pay means you are in their pocket
[12:11:57] <DunceCotus> they've got you by the fear-organs
[12:12:08] <ButterNoodle> just like booze, crack, and lolis.. I can stop paying anytime
[12:12:25] <DunceCotus> to stop paying means to stop living, at least in that configuration
[12:12:30] <ButterNoodle> incorrect
[12:12:33] <MootPoot> I need money
[12:12:42] <MootPoot> Might start working retail
[12:12:49] <MootPoot> On the weekend
[12:12:58] <ButterNoodle> I told 65K worth of debt to fuck off.. everything is good now
[12:13:06] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: :/
[12:13:22] <ButterNoodle> remember
[12:13:23] <MootPoot> !c 15*8*2*4
[12:13:24] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 960
[12:13:28] <ButterNoodle> no one has to do anything
[12:13:31] <DunceCotus> I have a student debt but don't have to pay it off anytime soon
[12:13:39] <DunceCotus> only if I earn enough
[12:13:43] <ButterNoodle> thats nice
[12:13:45] <DunceCotus> indentured slaveitude
[12:13:46] <MootPoot> Working on weekends would get me another 1000
[12:13:57] <ButterNoodle> in america you take student loans to your grave
[12:14:04] <MootPoot> So I'd go up to 3400
[12:14:08] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: well same here, feasibly
[12:14:21] <DunceCotus> its just the requirement to pay right away may not be there unlike America
[12:14:28] <DunceCotus> but I dunno America that well on this 
[12:15:01] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: that's ridiculously high
[12:15:06] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: please give me your job
[12:15:32] <ButterNoodle> *I owe 26K
[12:15:46] <MootPoot> That's if I work two jobs, every day a week DunceCotus 
[12:15:57] <ButterNoodle> fuck that
[12:16:22] <ButterNoodle> I think I am going to pay off my kids student loan..
[12:16:31] <MootPoot> What
[12:16:32] <ButterNoodle> as a birthday present
[12:16:47] <ButterNoodle> its not much... probably 5-600$
[12:16:48] <MootPoot> I thought your kid never went to university
[12:16:55] <ButterNoodle> he went 1 semester
[12:16:58] <ButterNoodle> and failed everything
[12:17:06] <ButterNoodle> freshman seminar too
[12:17:16] <MootPoot> Damn
[12:17:27] <MootPoot> That's actually impressive at that point
[12:17:29] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: oh.. sounds gruelling
[12:17:30] <ButterNoodle> yea
[12:17:39] <ButterNoodle> thats like actually throwing at life
[12:17:44] <ButterNoodle> bottom 500
[12:18:01] <MootPoot> I got roasted the fuck out by everyone I know just by failing one class once 
[12:18:01] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: well at least they tried
[12:18:14] <MootPoot> 3 years ago
[12:18:20] <ButterNoodle> does not showing up after the first week of class count as trying?
[12:18:28] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: yes
[12:18:32] <MootPoot> No
[12:18:39] <DunceCotus> depends
[12:18:49] <HubertFarnsworth> hey ButterNoodle 
[12:18:51] <MootPoot> I mean my attending was spotty but I got though
[12:18:56] <ButterNoodle> that'd be like me getting up in the am.. taking my usual shit, stroke, eggs and coffee... and saying fuckit
[12:19:01] <ButterNoodle> going back to bed
[12:19:02] <DunceCotus> my university was a bitch to get to at the time in my life I went, so not getting to class or on time etc. is reasonable I think for some
[12:19:16] <DunceCotus> if you live on campus, sure, that's lazy as shitballs
[12:19:21] <MootPoot> My grades skyrocketed when we all went online 
[12:19:23] <ButterNoodle> had a car
[12:19:24] <DunceCotus> but then again, party atmosphere etc..
[12:19:28] <ButterNoodle> and lived 15 min away
[12:19:40] <ButterNoodle> yo HubertFarnsworth
[12:19:42] <MootPoot> Since back then I was still in the carb low energy deal
[12:20:04] <HubertFarnsworth> I also funked a lot back in uni
[12:20:25] <HubertFarnsworth> I didn't take it seriously
[12:20:28] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: end of the day trying could include absence
[12:20:31] <ButterNoodle> as an adult that went, and kept above a 3.0 gpa the entire time.. while working 60+ hours a week.. and having a shitty family..
[12:20:34] <ButterNoodle> its not hard
[12:20:58] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: that's your subjective experience
[12:21:01] <DunceCotus> not everyone shares it
[12:21:01] <ButterNoodle> literally sitting in class was relaxing compared to the rest of the adult world
[12:21:06] <ButterNoodle> true
[12:21:28] <ButterNoodle> try is very subjective in the everyone gets a trophy twitterverse
[12:21:55] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: you know most find it hard to get back on studies after a break
[12:21:56] <DunceCotus> well twitter is now more concerned with removing trophies from certain everyones
[12:21:57] <MootPoot> Damn butter has a 3.0 gpa
[12:22:03] <ButterNoodle> its ok tho.. u wanna throw at life, get thrown out
[12:22:12] <MootPoot> I think I clocked in at a 2.9 or something final 
[12:22:14] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: it was higher than that..
[12:22:22] <MootPoot> But I'm still going 
[12:22:29] <MootPoot> I'll see what my final GPA is 
[12:22:34] <MootPoot> Not that it really matters 
[12:22:41] <MootPoot> Anymore
[12:22:43] <HubertFarnsworth> dude, keep it above 3.0!!
[12:22:43] <ButterNoodle> it doesn't mean shit on a resume
[12:22:55] <DunceCotus> imagine caring about resumes
[12:23:03] <DunceCotus> what kind of world do we live in where such a thing matters
[12:23:05] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: it doesn't?
[12:23:29] <HubertFarnsworth> you mean gpa?
[12:23:30] <ButterNoodle> not here
[12:23:32] <ButterNoodle> yes
[12:23:54] <HubertFarnsworth> skill set is more important I guess
[12:23:58] <ButterNoodle> and a college degree really means u were able to pay for and sit through college..
[12:24:13] <MootPoot> It only matters if you stay within academia
[12:24:20] <MootPoot> Mostly for IT people 
[12:24:28] <MootPoot> After your first job it's long forgotten
[12:24:38] <ButterNoodle> it matters on pay scale
[12:24:58] <MootPoot> Well, what degree you have , not the GPA 
[12:25:09] <ButterNoodle> doesnt even matter on what kind of degree
[12:25:09] <DunceCotus> imagine what kind of world do we live in where if you don't have a good resume you can't eat or have basic freedom
[12:25:15] <MootPoot> A master's will help you get into C suite afaik
[12:25:33] <DunceCotus> and even if you do have a good resume you have to continually work to maintain the resume
[12:25:44] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: that exists in 3rd world cuntries and china
[12:25:47] <HubertFarnsworth> maybe it first but after years of experience, have a degree is not really much
[12:25:59] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: it exists everywhere
[12:26:05] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: capitalism is global
[12:26:07] <ButterNoodle> not really
[12:26:24] <HubertFarnsworth> DunceCotus: are you in IT?
[12:26:43] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: yes and no
[12:27:11] <HubertFarnsworth> so you work in an IT company but your job isn't IT related
[12:27:37] <HubertFarnsworth> don't tell me you have studied management? urghh
[12:27:43] <DunceCotus> it does not matter where I've worked
[12:27:50] <DunceCotus> its all the same
[12:27:50] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: me
[12:28:01] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: wait, really?
[12:28:02] <ButterNoodle> I have bijinisu degreeeeee
[12:28:10] <HubertFarnsworth> ughhh
[12:28:23] <HubertFarnsworth> how can you sit through that shit man?
[12:28:28] <ButterNoodle> its ez
[12:28:39] <ButterNoodle> finance and accounting.. 
[12:28:48] <HubertFarnsworth> but it's seriously boring
[12:28:52] <ButterNoodle> didnt care for marketing.. mainly because the professor was an idiot
[12:28:57] <ButterNoodle> yea
[12:29:03] <ButterNoodle> fun stuff is hard
[12:29:05] <MootPoot> Woah u have a business degree butter 
[12:29:12] <MootPoot> Interesting
[12:29:43] <ButterNoodle> with 2 minors
[12:29:47] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: so you do understand high finance, macroeconomics and all that stuff
[12:29:47] <ButterNoodle> :|
[12:29:54] <ButterNoodle> not really
[12:30:12] <MootPoot> But generally a degree does only mean "you have the capability of leaning things after basic highschool without being spoonfed"..kinda
[12:30:13] <DunceCotus> its all just bollocks to keep us locked up
[12:30:17] <ButterNoodle> if I did mba and specialized in something probably
[12:30:20] <HubertFarnsworth> what is it that deals with real world? macroeconomics?
[12:30:29] <DunceCotus> tis  a straitjacket on the consciousness of the nomadic subject
[12:30:31] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: realecononics
[12:30:32] <ButterNoodle> but I'd do the IT track if I went back for that
[12:30:40] <HubertFarnsworth> lol MootPoot 
[12:30:48] <ButterNoodle> that has a lot of statistics and database stuff in it
[12:31:24] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: you can climb the ladder easily now, are you still at tech side or are you project lead or something like that?
[12:31:26] <ButterNoodle> if I actually had unlimited free time to study I'd like to finish my mechanical engineering degree
[12:31:54] <MootPoot> Wtf butter 
[12:32:00] <MootPoot> You told me you always finished 
[12:32:03] <ButterNoodle> my job is strange... I'm like a consulting architect for a software solution
[12:32:09] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea
[12:32:16] <ButterNoodle> thats the only thing I didnt finish
[12:32:35] <ButterNoodle> bc hard..
[12:32:37] <HubertFarnsworth> that's nice man ButterNoodle, you already know a lot of ICE and stuff right? like you can repair your own car
[12:32:38] <ButterNoodle> it was fun tho
[12:32:48] <ButterNoodle> I do lots of stuff
[12:33:25] <DunceCotus> I C E-men
[12:33:25] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: I bet you'd be fun to hang around in real life
[12:33:59] <ButterNoodle> *it is possible.. I dont have irl friends tbh.. just a few people online and my ##anime family
[12:34:19] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: I used to have interests and passions but not now sadly. All I do is read books now.
[12:34:41] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: what happened?
[12:34:44] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: that's alright, friends drift away
[12:34:51] <ButterNoodle> they do..
[12:35:01] <ButterNoodle> we all get our own lives
[12:35:15] * MootPoot watches his friends get in a tuned hoonigan corvette and start drifting
[12:35:22] <MootPoot> Damn
[12:35:34] <HubertFarnsworth> DunceCotus: just lost interest, it happens in life, what you want now is what you want all the time or life
[12:35:41] <ButterNoodle> I wanna motorcycle drift
[12:35:43] <ButterNoodle> and not die
[12:36:26] <DunceCotus> if you lost interest its probably where you last look
[12:37:18] <HubertFarnsworth> why not die? what's so great about living?
[12:37:40] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: what is die
[12:37:52] <DunceCotus> what is die in the living
[12:37:59] <HubertFarnsworth> I wanna read shit ton of books and write some, then die
[12:38:04] <MootPoot> Sudo die -F
[12:38:10] <HubertFarnsworth> dying is freedom, DunceCotus 
[12:38:25] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: freedom.. like before we were born?
[12:38:30] <HubertFarnsworth> freedom from pain, taxes, working and most of all living
[12:38:45] <DunceCotus> freedom from all of that requires dying?
[12:38:52] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, not existing is good
[12:38:59] <HubertFarnsworth> look at the world around
[12:38:59] <DunceCotus> is it?
[12:39:11] <DunceCotus> not existing may seem good on paper
[12:39:28] <DunceCotus> I do not think death is 'not existing'
[12:39:34] <DunceCotus> its a complicated game
[12:40:02] <HubertFarnsworth> at least we won't be conscious, our consciousness ceases to exist
[12:40:18] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: don't force death dude
[12:40:22] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: we won't be conscious in the same ego
[12:40:35] <DunceCotus> perhaps a blend of an old and new one
[12:40:40] <DunceCotus> or a new one entirely
[12:40:55] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: life IS after-life?
[12:40:56] <HubertFarnsworth> fancy that
[12:41:17] <DunceCotus> so we do need to change life if we want freedom I think
[12:41:36] <HubertFarnsworth> sure, we are free to think
[12:41:47] <HubertFarnsworth> but I am not of same opinion
[12:41:48] <DunceCotus> is that enough?
[12:41:59] <HubertFarnsworth> enough?
[12:42:11] <DunceCotus> enough freedom?
[12:43:51] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: I don't think its as simple as non-existence
[12:44:14] <DunceCotus> that's the physicalist's denial perhaps
[12:44:31] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: have you seen that anime where a girl takes up motorcycling
[12:44:32] <DunceCotus> but i also don't think its as simple as heaven/hell either

[15:42:39] <analoq> Sadale: i tend to believe that 'hating things is mainstream'
[15:43:03] <analoq> docker isnt a do it all solution. but it must be good at something, otherwise it wouldnt be as big as it is
[15:43:11] <Sadale> And scaling is barely an issue to me. So using docker won't do me any good at all. Not to mention that it's possible to do scaling even without docket
[15:43:28] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you need to consider these things before you decide to do it
[15:43:34] <Sadale> Not really. It could be just overhyped. And maybe they're real good at marketing their shit

[15:43:50] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, yep

[15:43:59] <HubertFarnsworth> it's hard Sadale

[15:44:23] <amigojapan> darkwitch: now not not
[15:44:24] <analoq> if you dislike it for facts then sure thats fine. disliking it because 'the internet does' is not in my book
[15:44:25] <Sadale> analoq, overcomplicated. The same thing could be done with other technologies like chroot.
[15:44:41] <analoq> Sadale: can you croot windows containers?
[15:45:10] <Sadale> analoq, I said that I've actually used it. I just find that it takes extra time for me to create a container and stuffs. It'd save me time if I just install the software that I need manually.
[15:45:13] <analoq> can you croot other hardware architectures?
[15:45:48] <Sadale> I'm not trying to say that you should avoid docker at all cost. If it suits your need, use it. Like for gitlab CI as you said, it supports docker. So use it.
[15:46:06] <analoq> well it does add something, but imho it seems to generate value. now if that value is required for a task is a different question imho.

[15:48:35] <Sadale> oh. And I remember. I couldn't rememebr my docker setup and stuffs. I'm not sure if it's a problem of docker or docker-swarm. In my setup tho, whenever a docker-based service starts, it creates a new container instance. And that's a problem because it took space and resources to create a new instance. And I was using a low-end VPS
[15:49:43] <analoq> yeah the whole container/ image stopping/deleting stuff is quite bloated. but then again im a total docker newb so maybe im just stupid

[23:40:51] <Sxem> On its initial release, the Windows version of the 2021 Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, which included San Andreas, was pulled by Rockstar a few days after launch, claiming that there were "unintentionally included" files in the distribution. Users that had downloaded the game found that the version still included content that the Hot Coffee mod would have accessed.
[23:49:06] <emmeka> lol
[23:50:02] <emmeka> I remember hearing about that back in the day as almost urban legend material, like people claiming that there were tricks you could do to get it working on the PS2 if you did certain things with your dates, or whatever
[23:52:57] <snake> I feel like a sex scene in an adult show or game is acceptable
[23:53:21] <snake> Sad they are pulling the scene that they never intended to release anyways
[23:59:35] <emmeka> well, in 2005 at least, white suburban moms across America lost their shit at these things
