[00:04:09] <Khepra> velix: fwiw, I insta-junk anything coming out of ses on all of the MTAs I admin. And I know I'm not the only one. I wouldn't use taht if I were you and wanted deliverability.
[00:05:38] <velix> Khepra: junk can be on any public mail server.
[00:05:58] <velix> Khepra: Who gives me the guarantee, there's no junk on Mailjet/Mailgun etc.
[00:06:09] <Khepra> well, I instajunk those too :)
[00:06:26] <Khepra> I have yet to see a single non-marketing transactional email coming out of those nets.
[00:06:29] <velix> Khepra: So... dedicated IP? I've fresh IPs only.
[00:06:47] <velix> virgin IPs with no mail experience.
[00:07:32] <lunaphyte> ses is no better nor no worse than any of the other email service providers
[00:07:42] <Khepra> these days we're advising our clients to move to big providers. the battle has been lost. they won.
[00:07:54] <lunaphyte> if someone is indiscriminately marking all mail from esps as junk, they are in the minority
[00:08:45] <Khepra> I think you're confusig marketing engines from transactional MTA ESPs
[00:09:12] <lunaphyte> ok
[00:09:14] <Khepra> the latter we of course do not junk automatically. the former, send only marketing networks, are instajunked
[00:09:32] <Khepra> ses, mailgun, mailchimp, sendgrid, ...
[00:09:51] <velix> You can set SES to transactional or marketing... So transaction might use cleaner routes.
[00:09:53] <lunaphyte> those are all esps
[00:10:27] <lunaphyte> suggesting they are empirically sending only one "type" of email is misguided
[00:10:41] <Khepra> it's based on experience and real world data.
[00:11:45] <lunaphyte> all esps are going to send all types of email
[00:12:49] <Khepra> that's not what experience has shown, and statistics from a spamtrap network of tens of thousands of traps.
[00:14:05] <Khepra> this argumetn is similar to experience showing that sending out of OVH is going to suck for deliverability. and yet your argument is analogous to "they're just another hosting provider, and suggesting they're empirically hosting only one 'type' of senders  is misguided"
[00:14:45] <lunaphyte> ok
[00:14:48] <lunaphyte> if you say so

[15:43:32] <pj> I don't think mailchimp does it anymore for years now.

[15:54:49] <pj> I don't have any that I can recommend, but that doesn't mean that there aren't good ones.  I'm sure others here can pipe in with a recommendation, but most will be asleep right now.
[15:55:13] <deuxexmachina> sparkpost hasn't failed me... their support & engineering is a bit lame though
[15:55:13] <pj> and yeah, it does help, but you need to get a good relayhost, or it can backfire.
[15:55:34] <deuxexmachina> they broke their own API before and the outdated NPMs are a bit annoying
[15:55:36] <pj> if you have good experience with them then by all means stick with them..

[18:52:02] <colo> I successfully interviewed with Google (Ireland) in 2011 for SRE, but in the end decided not to move there to join them (my father was diagnosed of cancer shortly before the last round and I wanted to be able to spend time with my family). always felt like I had missed an opportunity back then, but during the last years, that has change to a kind of relief. that company REALLY took a turn for the worse.
[18:53:52] <minimal> colo: how many interviews did you go through with them and over what period of time? they're know for taking months/years and many interviews to decide
[18:54:06] <minimal> rob0: DTRT?
[18:55:18] <colo> minimal, I think it was three or very rather short to one-hour-long ones by phone and/or screensharing, and an extensive day-long session on site
[18:59:14] <deuxexmachina> yes, unfortunate at the consolidation of power... unnecessary for linode
[19:14:46] <lunaphyte> well, that depends on the perspective

[20:47:08] <velix> Wow, SES is really nice. DOmain is verified now.
[20:47:13] <velix> DMARK etc. ist working.
[20:47:18] <velix> *C
[20:59:36] <velix> meeh, but Spamd is getting me a "FORGED_SENDER" entry :(
[21:07:15] <Khepra> welp
[21:13:47] *** Quits: puff (~user@S0106d4ca6d80a83c.vs.shawcable.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:16:24] <JPT> Rspamd "FORGED_SENDER" does not seem to be related to DMARC: "Sender is forged (different From: header and smtp MAIL FROM: addresses)"
[21:16:38] <JPT> https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/blob/e2c9ea10a36bd2f48d4570123062d8af6dffc513/conf/scores.d/headers_group.conf#L23
[21:18:17] <velix> Khepra: what does "welp" mean?
[21:19:50] <velix> JPT: Actually the issue occures from "velix@mailtest.mydomain.org" and "velix@mydomain.org" (where mailtest.mydomain.org is registered on SES). Seems liek this can't be worked around?
[21:20:35] <velix> SMTP FROM is amazonses.com I guess?
[21:23:00] <JPT> Technically, such a difference shouldn't be that bad if it still aligns. That symbol alone won't be enough to flag a malicious email on its own
[21:24:29] <colo> "forged" is kind of a big word in these circumstances.
[21:25:32] <JPT> It should be called a "mismatch". If you're violating a DMARC policy, that's forgery.
[21:39:57] <velix> but it should be valid? SES said: no problem
[21:40:32] <velix> meh, I'm gonna send them letters by post and telefax

[22:05:59] <velix> FORGED_MUA_THUNDERBIRD_MSGID_UNKNOWN(2.50)[]; <-- this is annoying. Using Thunderbird for sending through SES's SMTP is baaad
[22:11:36] <JPT> You can always adjust the score for your the symbols, depending on what you need. What is your goal?
[22:17:48] <velix> JPT: I'm the sender ;) I'm trying to get my mails not into spam.
[22:18:04] <velix> So I can't tweak anything on my side :(
[22:18:33] <JPT> Ah. I guess you can try to optimize against Rspamd and see how good you can get. But apart from that, if dkim/dmarc is set up properly and your ip reputation is fine, you should be good
[22:18:43] <velix> Aaah, turning off the user agent did it! -0.69 / 15.00
[22:19:21] <velix> SPF, DKIM and DMARC are fine. And Amazon SES seems to have a fine reputation. We talked about this yesterday. It might be better than using my hoster's IP ;)
[22:19:50] <velix> our university recently switched their old, high reputated IP address and now... they're doomed :D
[22:20:12] <JPT> oh no :D
[22:20:15] <velix> They got onto the blacklist on the first weekend.
[22:20:25] <velix> erm ... on many deny-lists.
[22:20:48] <JPT> That's not surprising. If a new ip address appears and suddenly blasts out a ton of email, it will end up on a lot of lists very quickly. 
[22:20:55] <velix> exactly!
[22:21:10] <velix> "This IP just started to send lots of mail" blah blah
[22:21:28] <velix> the old IP was listed on many education whitelist
[22:21:32] <velix> whitelists*
[22:21:37] <velix> Sorry, my keyboard is broken :D
[22:22:07] <velix> Our departments wants to step away from the new mailserver for some transactional mails, until they got it fixed a bit.
[22:22:29] <JPT> I received a sort of request from some higher-ups that they wanted me to explicitly prevent certain sender adresses from ever going into the spam folder. Yeah, right. Blindly trust some sender domain that doesn't have a DMARC policy? Nope.

[22:23:38] <bremner> just explain you're not sure the dilithium crystals can take the load, but you'll try
[22:23:59] <velix> bremner: Nobody needs dilithium crystals anymore in the near future.
[22:24:12] <velix> bremner: but the prototype of ... was stolen (spoiler)
[22:24:22] <JPT> If only things were that easy ... 
[22:24:40] <velix> bremner: Also, those crystals can be re-crystalized. BUt the queen won't tell anyone.
[22:25:46] <velix> Funny, User-Agent: "" has a better rating than Thunderbird in this server's rspam setup ;)
[22:26:15] <bremner> User-Agent is a browser thing, not an email thing?
[22:26:40] <velix> bremner: Thunderbird uses it.
[22:26:58] <velix> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/91.6.0
[22:27:13] <velix> and rspam parses it ;)
[22:27:18] <bremner> OK. I see a few in my mail store from various mailers. I don't think it's in an RFC, but whatever
[22:28:30] <bremner> how embarassing. The obscure MUA I maintain adds User-Agent headers.
[22:29:45] <colo> I am aware of X-Mailer
[22:30:37] <velix> Ha, when turning the User-Agent off, I'm down to -0.70 / 15.00
[22:30:59] <velix> So FORGED_SENDER is the only thing that pushes me up 0.3
[22:31:09] <velix> Sad, but fine.
[22:32:22] <velix> Seems like I've found a bug in SES. In "Message-ID", it uses @eu-central-1.amazonses.com ... but anywhere else it uses @mailtest.mydomain.org
[22:32:32] <bremner> apparently User-Agent is standardized for netnews, but not for mail
[22:32:40] <bremner> message-id is an opaque identifier
[22:32:55] <velix> bremner: Yeah, but my inner Monk wants this to be aligend with the other ones :D
[22:33:22] <bremner> that's not how message-id works. It's generated by the sender and (should be) guaranteed to be unique
[22:33:39] <velix> bremner: Actually, it's rewritten by ses then.
