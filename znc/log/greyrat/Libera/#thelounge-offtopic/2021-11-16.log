[08:20:51] <luva> Thank you all for thelounge. Its one of the coolest things ever. I wouldnt use IRC as I do now, because of thelounge. Its so easy to use and adds so much comfort to irc
[08:22:39] <bookworm> ^^
[10:57:00] <c014> Yep, it's great.. let's hope the file sharing gets developed and we get some sort of snippet-pastebin thing
[11:30:36] <MaxLeiter> https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/e9b69aa97c467db6/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-16%20at%2012.00.14%20AM.png something like this, c014?
[11:32:06] <c014> yes exactly
[11:33:02] <c014> is that from irccloud?
[11:33:26] <MaxLeiter> if you're feeling adventurous, try the maxleiter/textUpload branch
[11:33:39] <MaxLeiter> maxleiter/textUpload*
[11:34:22] <MaxLeiter> hm, monospace doesnt like nicks inside it
[11:37:05] <c014> I'm not so good at these things.. can I apply that branch to this installation somehow?
[11:37:41] <c014> maxleiter branch = pre release ?
[11:37:47] <MaxLeiter> no
[11:37:50] <MaxLeiter> probably not
[11:38:02] <MaxLeiter> no to pre-rel, probably not to first question

[23:31:41] <xnaas> toro: your mom's off-topic!
[23:31:51] <xnaas> I never liked kiwi and never gave it a chance lol
[23:32:27] <toro> I got tired of kiwi and Mibbit having prolonged outages that I‚Äôd get screamed at over
[23:32:28] <xnaas> I know thelounge uses the same backend components for the irc protocol stuff, but the UI is about a trillion times better, I guess :P
[23:32:39] <toro> Went with kiwi because it‚Äôs self hosted
[23:33:14] <toro> it‚Äôs stable but , I want to redirect password authenticated users to a private instance of thelounge so they do not get kicked off every 2 minutes on mobile
[23:33:30] <xnaas> logical, heh
[23:33:55] <toro> kinda wish it did that out of the box but I can make it default to anonymous and redirect for authenticated
[23:34:10] <toro> we want both modes
[23:35:24] <xnaas> Ah, you mean having it be both private and public?
[23:35:27] <toro> yes
[23:35:36] <xnaas> That'd be cool, but I understand no one wanting to program the complexity. :P
[23:36:04] <toro> I‚Äôm going to cheat at first and just make ‚ÄúI have a password‚Äù a refresh to the private version with the box propagated and open
[23:36:15] <xnaas> üòè
[23:36:51] <Activ8> you could password protect the public instance with a frontend
[23:37:51] <toro> we do depression and substance abuse support so people want one click anonymous entry
[23:38:04] <toro> but we like what thelounge does and want to give that to registered people
[23:38:28] <toro> I kinda have a rough idea about implementation
[23:39:11] <xnaas>  /nick definitely-not-on-ketamine
[23:39:16] <toro> LOL
[23:39:32] <xnaas> (though that's probably too long for irc idk)
[23:39:57] <Activ8> oh yeh you said that yesterday sorry 
[23:40:04] <toro> it might not be for unreal lol
[23:40:21] <xnaas> ergo: https://xnaas.info/tmp/Pp8.webp
[23:40:27] <xnaas> s/32/128
[23:40:29] <xnaas> üòâ
[23:40:34] <xnaas> 32 is a lot, though
[23:40:36] <toro> I got unfriended by someone ranting about people ‚Äúeating horse paste‚Äù and how that‚Äôs for animals
[23:40:43] <toro> I replied, you do veterinary ketamine
[23:40:49] <toro> and got blocked
[23:40:55] <xnaas> makes sense
[23:41:04] <xnaas> it's never ok to bring logic or facts into a discussion anymore
[23:41:05] <xnaas> ü§™
[23:41:10] <toro> üò≠
[23:41:13] <xnaas> :)
[23:41:45] <toro> so worth it
[23:44:11] <Activ8> I'm not so sure you can make jokes about drugs to someone who takes them 
[23:44:18] <Activ8> don't think they will take that lightly
[23:50:05] <toro> I miss when people were still fun and funny
[23:50:09] <toro> in general
[23:50:18] <xnaas> Ye Olde Days
[23:51:09] <toro> I‚Äôve been in Mexico for a few years so I‚Äôm out of the loop on everything and seem to be one of the only people who hasn‚Äôt changed much
[23:51:27] <toro> we don‚Äôt even have cell service in my town
[23:51:41] <toro> I‚Äôm online because I‚Äôm visiting Mexico citi
[23:52:13] <toro> 57 up and down on cellular sheesh
[23:52:28] <xnaas> ‚ö° lightening fast
[23:52:41] <xnaas> lightning
[23:52:47] <toro> yeah it is. lol. I get 8 kilobytes down at home :D
[23:52:49] * xnaas engrish 2day
[23:52:51] <toro> kilobytes
[23:52:55] <xnaas> nice
[23:53:15] <Activ8> lol
[23:54:34] <xnaas> Was just talking with a coworker earlier about a guy in Bangladesh he was helping once (previous job) that still had internet measured in baud! 14400, so I guess something like 1.8KB/s lol
[23:54:41] <toro> hahaha
[23:54:43] <toro> I believe it
[23:54:47] <Activ8> that's nasty
[23:55:09] <xnaas> He did some sort of sales or something, and he only got access to that connection once a month for 8 hours to upload his data lol
[23:55:28] <toro> I go to the tienda and use their wifi for service packs etc
[23:55:35] <Activ8> what was he using floppy dicks
[23:55:37] <toro> and just am used to getting kicked out of ash all day
[23:55:40] <toro> ssh
[23:56:07] <xnaas> I wonder if uh...whatever that thing is called would help
[23:56:16] <xnaas> it's ssh with a shitload of ports and designed for shit internet
[23:56:26] <xnaas> mosh?
[23:56:32] <Activ8> just for info Microsoft dropped 21H2 ISOs today
[23:56:41] <Activ8> the webs been flooded with updates
[23:56:42] <xnaas> https://mosh.org/
[23:57:51] <xnaas> I don't have any need for it, but seems like a potentially valid solution for people in your state of internet. :P
[23:59:18] <xnaas> https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh ‚Äî it looks like it still gets commits, but they haven't cut a release since 2017 lol
