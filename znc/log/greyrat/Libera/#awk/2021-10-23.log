[00:03:10] <nmz> insert a variable in the middle of your string
[00:04:50] <emanuele6> foo: |
[00:04:55] <emanuele6>  this is hello: 5 text
[00:04:59] <emanuele6> you mean like this?
[00:05:31] <emanuele6> that is equivalent to {"foo":this is hello: 5 text\n"}
[00:05:35] <emanuele6> oops
[00:05:47] <emanuele6> that is equivalent to {"foo":"this is hello: 5 text\n"}
[00:06:26] <emanuele6> foo: |
[00:06:29] <emanuele6> this is hello: 5 text
[00:06:57] <emanuele6> and this is equivalent to {"foo":"","this is hello":"5 text"}

[08:56:37] <Dunce> Does anyone know how to replicate the following command on Windows? Ex: awk -F= '{gsub(":",""); print tolower ($2)}'
[08:57:58] <Dunce> I assume it converts my certificate's fingerprint somehow, but I can't figure it out. I've tried figuring out how it's formatted, so maybe I could find an online conversion tool, but no luck.
[08:58:51] <llua> see a windows channel?
[08:58:58] <llua> or install awk on windows?
[09:01:26] <OMGOMG> # echo :omg=:wtf=:lol | awk -F= '{gsub(":",""); print tolower ($2)}'

[09:02:54] <Dunce> OMGOMG, I can't tell if that's a troll, but I'll try it out. Thanks.
[09:03:04] <Dunce> _Wait
[09:03:16] <Dunce> That wouldn't do anything different.
[09:03:43] <OMGOMG> no, it just demonstrates what it does. isn't that what you wanted to know?
[09:03:46] <Dunce> The whole awk line isn't interpreted by Windows properly.
[09:03:49] <Dunce> Oh no.
[09:04:01] <Dunce> I'm trying to do this "openssl x509 -in libera.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha512 | awk -F= '{gsub(":",""); print tolower ($2)}'"
[09:04:31] <Dunce> I got the first part, but it gives me a weird fingerprint with colons in-between every two characters.
[09:05:05] <OMGOMG> delete them with your favourite windows tool
[09:08:54] <Dunce> No way.
[09:08:58] <Dunce> Is that really it?
