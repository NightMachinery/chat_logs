[09:19:14] <purplex> have you documented any problems you noticed?
[09:27:12] <jargon> I last used this code 5 or 6 years ago.
[09:28:18] <jargon> It uses a str_replace, preg_replace, preg_match, eval pipeline.
[09:31:21] <jargon> It also makes heavy use of file_get_contents.
[09:31:27] <purplex> why is it called an engine? is it more than just a single string of regex?
[09:31:50] <jargon> However all of that is abstracted away with markdown.
[09:32:23] <jargon> It is literally a markdown engine which is powered by pcre.
[09:32:58] <jargon> It handles embedded pages of markdown.

[09:35:22] <purplex> handles = validates?

[09:39:31] <jargon> The markdown is based off the markdown used by TwitchTV.
[09:39:50] <jargon> However, it handles the full scope of HTML 3.x

[11:31:52] <friend> Thanks. I guess I didn't think about that. I really appreciate your help. This was the regex I was working with to isolate rational numbers including .56 for example: https://regex101.com/r/HUSV9Z/2
[11:32:38] <friend> But it's capturing the space before the number. I tried with \b for word boundary and it left off the number .54 --captured them as 54
[11:33:05] <Andrio> . isn't a word character, so there is no word boundary between it and a space.
[11:33:13] <Andrio> hence the lookbehind.

[13:39:55] <friend> I didn't see your response until after I had resolved the issue. I was looking for rational numbers in text. So ^ and $ only work if the numbers are on their own line.
[13:40:41] <purplex> yep i also suggested a lookbehind as suggested before
[13:40:48] <friend> I'm trying to avoid things like phone numbers, sssn numbers, credit card numbers, but capture rational numbers and non-zero-based rationals.
[13:41:44] <purplex> what's a rational number for you?
[13:41:52] <friend> thanks for following up with me. Sorry I didn't reply, I thought two hours was too late to reply politely.
[13:42:42] <friend> numbers like +333.333 or -3.333 or .333 or 33 for example that are not preceded by ({["< etc.
[13:43:00] <purplex> you were saying .33.33 isn't one of them and you want to add a '0' before .?
[13:43:23] <purplex> ok so now there can be a + or - as well
[13:43:41] <friend> right, i kept getting numbers that had multiple periods and missing numbers that ommitted the 0 like .33
[13:44:28] <friend> I thought maybe had a feature that would automatically add a 0 to number slike .33   It's for a textbook that I wanted to style the rational numbers differently.
[13:44:58] <purplex> so we can remove ^ and $ from it then it will satisfy your requirements
[13:46:44] <purplex> suppose you had: .5 .99 .33.33.33 0.58 .689 .66.7 and you want this to be replaced as: 0.5 0.99 .33.33.33 0.58 0.689 .66.7, right?

[14:04:15] <purplex> it won't match, it will replace
[14:05:02] <friend> wow. Sorry if I am not being clear here. The original question was replaced by the bigger context. I need to find all examples of numbers that look like 0.5 .5 or 5 that aren't part of other known number formats (like ssn)
[14:05:21] <friend> I need to format rational numbers differently than say phone numbers, for example.
[14:05:58] <purplex> okay so now its a different question..
[14:06:15] <friend> so in that scope of finding rational numbers, I wondered if there was a way to automatically replace .5 with 0.5 Which there isn't. So we moved on.

[21:55:03] <agopo> Hi, I want to match only the URL in the given Test String. In the real world setting the website is filled with many links, so I'm trying to match the correct one by giving context. How do I capture only the URL?
[21:55:06] <agopo> https://regex101.com/r/0ZB6zT/1
[21:55:37] <agopo> I'm on bash, the test string is source code from a curl result
[21:56:52] <OnlineCop> agopo: Do you know that the URL will always start with a specific protocol, like 'http'/'https'?
[21:57:19] <agopo> OnlineCop, No, not 100% sure
[21:57:24] <agopo> Usually yes, but cant guarantee
[21:57:24] <OnlineCop> agopo: Also, are you using `grep -P` for the PCRE, or something else?
[21:57:47] <agopo> I've tried grep -Eoi 'regexstring' so far
[21:58:36] <OnlineCop> `grep -E` is the extended regex, and is POSIX-compatible, but `-P` enables PCRE support (not available on FreeBSD like MacOS, but usually on all other GNU greps).
[21:59:30] <OnlineCop> A simple approach is to change `(.+)` to `(.+?)` but that won't handle "string \"with nested\" quotes".
[21:59:30] <agopo> Okay I'll switch to grep -Poi
[22:00:21] <OnlineCop> If you use `-P`, you can additionally use `\K` before the text you want to keep so it discards everything that matched up to that point.
[22:00:53] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/0ZB6zT/2 is another way you could use it.

[22:40:25] <purplex> agopo: you have that / before ^
[22:41:15] <purplex> is that how you input into grep search? (i don't often use it)
[22:44:56] <agopo> It's from OnlineCop's take on things. On regex101 it works as intended
[22:45:13] <agopo> purplex, in grep usually all you do is: grep 'string'

[22:46:56] <purplex> I am talking about grep -P 50here --> '/^\Q<th sc.. on regex101, there's no /
[22:48:25] <purplex> if its a delimiter, does it go only at the start, but not the end, like /regex/
[22:50:09] <agopo> You're right, I wrongly copied that forward slash from regex101
[22:50:33] <agopo> To my defense: it does so, when you use the copy button to the right o0
[22:50:49] <agopo> which is very odd
[22:51:08] <purplex> its not. it copies: /^\Q<th scope="row">\E\n^\Q<a href=\E"\K((?>[^\\"]+|\\.)*)(?=")/gmi
[22:51:09] <agopo> removing the slash unfortuantely didn't lead to the desired output though
[22:51:29] <purplex> you removed the part /gmi
[22:51:46] <agopo> so shouldn't I remove either one of them?
[22:52:16] <purplex> those are flags after the regular expression, and i think you need them
[22:52:33] <purplex> depends on how grep syntax is laid out
[22:52:54] <OnlineCop> Does `website.txt` use CRLF or LF line endings?
[22:53:05] <OnlineCop> If CRLF, change your `\n` to `\r?\n`
[22:53:31] <OnlineCop> The `\r?` will match the form-feed IF it exists (CRLF) or just newline if it doesn't (LF).

[22:55:30] <agopo> so yes, kudos to you two
[22:55:38] <agopo> *the goal
[22:55:51] <OnlineCop> agopo: Don't forget to use `-o` along with `-P` for grep to show "only" the stuff you want.
[22:56:20] <OnlineCop> `grep -Po '^\Q<th scope="row">\E\r?\n\Q<a href=\E"((?>[^\\"]+|\\.)*)(?=")' website.txt`
[22:56:51] <OnlineCop> Or if you're piping it in from a variable or something: `grep -Po '...' <<<$"some_variable"`
[22:57:29] <agopo> OnlineCop, the website uses unix line endings LF
[22:57:52] <OnlineCop> That `\r?\n` should still work, but you can do just `\n` if you prefer.
[22:59:01] <OnlineCop> If it's still not giving any output, just look for the <a href= part, without the \Q and \E.
[23:00:55] <OnlineCop> Are you certain that the "<a href" line starts at column 0? No leading whitespace?
[23:01:37] <OnlineCop> Oh, right. Newlines + grep = nope.
[23:02:15] <OnlineCop> Use `grep -Poz` so grep can span newlines.
[23:03:40] <OnlineCop> grep reads in files line-by-line, using `\n` as the line delimiter. The `-z` flag changes the "line" delimiter to `\0` instead, so it reads in the entire file at once.
[23:03:56] <agopo> OnlineCop, yes I'm sure the <a ref="..." part starts without indentation
[23:05:10] <OnlineCop> You _might_ need to remove the '^' anchors in the pattern. I don't recall whether grep uses that after newline characters (even with the '-z' flag) or only to anchor at the start of the entire string.
[23:05:41] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/0ZB6zT/3 perhaps.
[23:09:22] <agopo> OnlineCop, THAT changed a lot!
[23:09:43] <agopo> Uhh that's an interesting output
[23:10:14] <OnlineCop> Sadly, `grep -z` will always report everything matched on "line 1", so if you're using the `-n` flag with it, it's not very useful.
[23:10:51] <agopo> Like I said, in the website source code there're are a lot of URLs. not all of them are interesting obviously. The only interesting ones all have the <th scope="row"> line befor them
[23:11:09] <agopo> OnlineCop, your new regex filters out ALL the URLs that match this behaviour
[23:11:14] <OnlineCop> If you install pcregrep (or pcre2grep), it has a multiline flag that will actually tell you the correct line number, and has the `-P` flag already built in.
[23:11:23] <agopo> but that's great. The best result is the very first one, so I can just cut the rest off
[23:11:50] <OnlineCop> The new regex is getting rid of the ones with '<th scope="row">` before them?
[23:12:24] <OnlineCop> Or the file simply has a lot of those, and you're only interested in a handful of them?
[23:12:27] <friend> \exit
[23:12:32] *** Quits: friend (~friend@user/friend) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:12:38] <agopo> the new one gives out all URLs that have the <th scope> before them, but without the <th scope> line. Also, no delimiter, so it's URLnospaceURLnospaceURL
[23:13:09] <agopo> The file has a lot of those and I'm only interested in the first one or two. But really, the goal is reached for the moment
[23:13:16] <agopo> How you did that baffles me honestly
[23:13:32] <agopo> So the hardship was the ^?
[23:14:54] <OnlineCop> Ah; that's due to the `\K` which resets the match position. You can keep that, if it makes it easier.
[23:15:29] <OnlineCop> I think the hardship was that grep doesn't read in multiple lines at a time, so matching `\n` doesn't work with it.
[23:16:17] <agopo> okay
[23:16:44] <OnlineCop> I think, if you go back to your version /1 on regex101, that just changing `"(.+)"` to non-greedy `"(.+?)"` might have been sufficient.
