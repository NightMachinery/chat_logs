[04:12:16] <Hash> use non standard ports
[04:12:30] <Hash> hide welcome banners and text upon connection, hide version strings
[04:13:28] <Hash> I just learned something new too that setup a vpn to a server who has nothing else but vpn, and have intenal network you can ssh into your servers from that vpn server
[04:13:44] <Hash> So anyone scanning your business or whatever, will only ever see a server with vpn,nothing else, and they can't get in.
[04:14:04] <Hash> You go through vpn, and access all the rest of your servers internally, even the ones who are public facing
[04:14:37] <Hash> That way you can only need to have 80 to 443 and 443 open, just two, and ssh, anything else is never open to public as it's behind internal network
[04:14:53] <Hash> Which I'm goint to do from now on as most VPS providers give you an internal ip and internal network.
[04:15:10] <Hash> so all the management can be done like this, and only absolutely necesarry public stuff is public.
[04:15:38] <Hash> I mean even ssh is behind internal network so never opent o the public
[04:16:01] <Hash> Wow i typed a lot. See now this is a monolgoue! That thumbs guy was smoking something funny :D hehe one line. :D
[04:17:01] <Hash> (however, this does require 2 servers to be setup, to additional cost just to have a vpn server as the only public facing server with management stuff)
[04:17:41] <Hash> I didn't word that right. additional cost to have a vpn only that you can use to get into your internal network to manage servers.
[04:18:19] <Hash> Which is actually not so bad. Considering ipv6 servers are like say on vultr $2.50 (pretty cheatp for a good infrastructure)

[04:20:40] <Hash> So only open ports on any of your servers are just 80/443 + the vpn port on server1
[04:20:42] <euouae> Why 80/443 open on server 1?
[04:21:07] <euouae> to direct traffic? is that what the vpn client uses?
[04:21:16] <Hash> This way, no one can ssh into any of your servers or anything else. Only you can ssh into you rservers from the vpn server to the server's internal ip address to manage it.

[07:58:07] <jaggz> thing in web server?
[07:58:30] <Poeticode> no, the api for Chrome/Firefox extensions
[07:58:43] <Hash> no clue.
[07:58:50] <jaggz> in this case it would see the original source file, which includes the <script ...> and would have to parse it.  It ALSO sees if and when the client hits /some/file.js to access it
[07:58:54] <Hash> look at all the permissions any extension is allowed to request
[07:58:57] <jaggz> oh
[07:59:07] <Hash> see if looking at all the loaded scripts is allowed
[07:59:11] <Hash> if so, you can probably do it.
[07:59:23] <Poeticode> hmm that's a good idea Hash
[07:59:31] <jaggz> yeah i'm not sure.. I know apis can access the html of a page.. and/or the DOM or whatever
[07:59:38] <jaggz> I presume they can access .js when it's hit too
[08:00:09] <Hash> if nothing else, probably the inspector api networking
[08:00:19] <Hash> see all the loaded .js resources, and do whatever with them.
[08:00:33] <Hash> extension on a browser is basically just the browser with some added js scripts.
[08:00:44] <Hash> extension is just a bunch of js scrips pakcaged up in a zip format anyway
[08:01:08] <Hash> #google might help or #chromium
[08:01:18] <Hash> or irc.mozilla.org #firefox
[08:01:34] <jaggz> the extension api docs would probably be a good choice

[12:36:44] <soulisson> CoJaBo, yes, it's a reverse shell. Can it be considered as a "web shell" also (both)?
[12:38:53] <piou> soulisson: there are times where your questions have an ambiguous response, but not this time :) No, it's definitely not a web shell.
[12:39:45] <soulisson> piou, ok, thanks a lot :)
[12:39:46] <piou> A web shell is one where commands are received by the vulnerable server through web requests. Here the server connects back to the attacker's server, so it's a reverse shell and the commands are received through this socket, not web requests.
[12:41:17] <soulisson> piou, ok, it makes sense. I had the same reasonning. I saw it categorized as a web shell on a site, so it made me wonder.

[20:09:51] <TimMc> About 15 years ago I was working as an intern and needed to install Adobe Flash on my work computer, but didn't have access. But I noticed that I could install Firefox as a managed application.
[20:10:25] <TimMc> The Firefox installer is a GUI thing that runs as administrator, and the last screen had a "start Firefox now" checkbox. Click that, click Finish, and Firefox would open as Administrator!

[20:14:56] <TimMc> You can't generally do this kind of escalation on Linux as far as I've seen -- a File Open dialog generally *only* allows selecting a file, not renaming and deleting and executing files.
[20:15:59] <TimMc> Installers may also open help files as admin, etc. (Then you can escalate from the Open or Print dialogs from the help program...)
[20:16:40] <TimMc> Really, the installer should fork a GUI that drops privs and communicates to the privileged process in a limited way.
[20:17:08] <TimMc> (or managed installs should not be interactive...)

[22:12:55] <Hash> Blah.
[22:13:02] <TimMc> If it's just a generic sandbox escape, your desktop password manager is probably equally at risk.
[22:13:07] <agonzal> the average user does not concern themselves with why they are updating, they just do it. hardly anyone I know out side of tech reads the reasons behind the update, maybe 1 person
[22:13:20] <Hash> Always read
[22:13:28] <Hash> you never know what an update does
[22:13:38] <Hash> you always gotta know so it doesn't do something goofy
[22:14:00] <ajak> do you read the code diff with the release? because changelogs can say anything they want
[22:14:18] <Hash> They don't provide code for osx/windows
[22:14:29] <ajak> then you don't know what's actually in the update anyway :D
[22:14:30] <Hash> linux, mostly it's binary packags being updated

[22:15:32] <ajak> sure, i'm just trying to point out your false sense of trust in changelogs
[22:15:46] <Hash> I'm trying to point out your FUD
[22:15:58] <Izem> h4zel: what are the building?
[22:16:02] <Hash> We have to put trust into those becausae it is not feasible for everyone to go through the code.
[22:16:08] <Hash> it's not a false sense of anything.
[22:16:24] <Hash> it's a required thing otherwise good luck spending all your time reading code.
[22:16:34] <Izem> I just read about factotum so I considered what if a browser had a auth manager

[22:17:25] <ajak> Hash: you said you "always gotta know", it's worth pointing out that you still don't necessarily know even when you read the changelog
[22:17:32] <Hash> Sure you do.
[22:18:11] <ajak> you can't guarantee all of the changes in a binary are documented in the changelog, lol
[22:18:25] <Hash> No one is saying that.
[22:18:28] <Hash> I don't want to argue.
[22:18:31] <Hash> Have a good day.
[22:18:49] <Hash> Making :D and 'lol' after sentences is... yeah. I'm already turned off.
[22:18:49] <TimMc> It's a good idea to read the changelog to see what kinds of new "features" are included that you might want to disable. :-)
[22:19:25] <Hash> How about you go read hundreds of package's source. I'll put my trust in the accuracy of the changelogs and the developers.
[22:19:54] * ajak isn't sure why it's controversial that changelogs might miss things
[22:20:03] <Hash> No one is arguing about that at all.
[22:20:53] <MadCamel> I hate it when there is no changelog. Netflix does that.
[22:21:01] <MadCamel> What's changed? WHO KNOWS!
[22:21:21] <Hash> I hate it when there are silly arguments with :D grinning mocking faces and 'lol's.
[22:21:43] <TimMc> ajak: Hash is taking a collaborative viewpoint (relative to the devs) and you're taking an adversarial viewpoint. Nothing productive is going to happen here unless you engage on the same assumptions.
[22:21:59] <ajak> well, i wasn't really trying to argue, and i add such things for levity (because i'm not trying to argue)

[22:22:30] <Hash> Sometimes we try to be nice and we end up coming off as pricks.
[22:23:26] <ajak> i don't think the devs are being naughty, i'm just saying sometimes they might leave things off of changelogs
[22:23:38] <TimMc> It's a best-effort thing.
[22:23:45] <ajak> exactly
[22:24:01] <ajak> sometimes things might be deliberately concealed though, like security issues (because might make the vendor look bad)
[22:24:10] <Hash> Again, if you wish to distrust changelogs and study hundreds of code files in packages sources and not just the diff, cuz the diff alone won't tell you anything without context.
[22:24:30] <Hash> So saying that you must consult the diff is a silly thing to say anyway. You have to always look at the whole piece of code in context.
[22:24:48] <Hash> It's extremely time consuming which is why auditing is a huge thing.
[22:25:14] <Hash> What you are suggesting is not feasible in the real world for every user. We trust a few parties to take care of tht for the rest of us.
[22:25:31] <Hash> Why are you using your EFI bios? you have no idea what's in the propriatary code.
[22:25:35] <ajak> i never suggested it was feasible
[22:25:37] <Hash> Stop using BIOS and motherborads.

[22:38:47] <Hash> php code auditing I can do (not easily but still learning)
[22:39:56] <Hash> other than the stuf fI already know, I gotta relearn all the network stuffs, protocols, protocol details, packet structures, how varous attacks work at the packegt level and to construct packets in python for injection across networks or to do particular attacks
