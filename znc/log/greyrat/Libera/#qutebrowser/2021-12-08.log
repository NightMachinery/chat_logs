[11:18:42] <low-key> is there a way to get qutebrowser to attempt https by default?
[11:47:04] <The-Compiler> low-key: depends - attempt https where?
[11:47:13] <low-key> when entering an url
[11:47:19] <low-key> without the scheme specified
[11:47:23] <low-key> it seems to default to https
[11:50:04] <bedlam> IIRC there's a way that DNS servers can tell the browser to use https, or am I imagining that?

[11:52:10] *** Joins: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at)
[11:53:13] <guido> bedlam: you mean HSTS?
[11:55:20] <bedlam> That's probably what I was thinking of.
[11:55:59] <guido> that's a header sent by websites, after you cache it browsers internally redirect http requests to https
[11:56:46] <guido> if a domain was submitted to the hsts preload list they are redirected even if you never visited the domain before
[11:57:23] <guido> so you don't really need to make qutebrowser use https by default since hsts already does that
[11:57:45] <bedlam> So it's not actually sent along with the DNS info?
[11:57:57] <bedlam> I mean from the DNS server.
[11:58:02] <guido> no
[11:58:18] <guido> a website maintainer configures apache/nginx/whatever to send a hsts header
[11:58:58] <The-Compiler> low-key: there's ":open -s" which forces https in the URL
[11:59:32] <bedlam> It looks like there's a draft RR for https at the moment.
[11:59:58] <The-Compiler> I should probably check what other browsers do nowadays when entering a host without scheme, but I suspect they'd also default to HTTP without HSTS (and no preloading)
[12:00:20] <The-Compiler> bedlam: huh?
[12:00:29] <bedlam> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https/00/?include_text=1
[12:00:51] <The-Compiler> bedlam: ah, that wasn't a typo for PR, nevermind me :D
[12:01:05] <bedlam> ok :-)
[12:02:00] <bedlam> What happens if you type something :open domain:443 ?
[12:02:17] <bedlam> :open domain.tld:443 even.
[12:02:37] <bedlam> something like*
[12:02:42] <bedlam> it's too early...
[12:03:06] <The-Compiler> bedlam: looks like HTTP on port 443 :D
[12:04:10] <guido> it erros
[12:04:59] <bedlam> That could possibly be done in python though.
[12:05:28] <bedlam> I mean, detect the :443 without a protocol and add https:// to the start.
[12:05:46] <guido> 400 Bad Request
[12:05:49] <guido> The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port
[12:05:54] <guido> nginx
[12:09:26] <bedlam> Or just leave it.
[12:10:01] <bedlam> There is bound to be someone wants to connect to 443 using http and complains/raises an issue :P
[12:17:45] <bedlam> :open -s seems ok though
