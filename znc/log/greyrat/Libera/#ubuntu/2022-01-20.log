[00:01:09] <agopo> I want to apt remove --purge all php* packages to prepare a clean install of php 8.0 . Only a few php-related packages are meant to stay. But sudo apt remove --purge php-* offers me libapache2-mod-php* libapache2-mod-php7.4* libapache2-mod-php8.0* phpmyadmin* pkg-php-tools* as well. I must be understanding the wildcard wrong. Can anyone help?

[00:04:30] <sarnold> agopo: that's probably best, different tools require different php versions

[00:57:49] <ubercube> I've now done a bit more reading about Secure Boot and come to the conclusion that it's worth at least experimenting with, but not in its default configuration. https://safeboot.dev/ seems to have the most comprehensive writeup on the subject I've found yet, though I'm going to have to do some of my own research on the AMD PSP side of things. Has
[00:57:49] <ubercube> anyone here tried what safeboot.dev is suggesting? I'm particularly happy that they take the re-signing steps seriously and store keys in hardware. I have no illusions, even with SIP enabled, that this will be as good as a pixel phone or an iOS device's secure boot chain (and those took many years and many bugs to get close to good). But I do think
[00:57:50] <ubercube> pushing these limits seems interesting and may have value for some threat models.

[01:01:26] <ubercube> I think that the nuance might depend on who you ask, but the general idea of controlling what runs on a given piece of hardware would be my answer. What that means to various parties certainly differs wildly. (Queue repeats of the TCG discussions form early on)

[01:07:45] <matsaman> octnun: okay, ye?
[01:08:57] <ubercube> sarnold: as I understand it, the microsoft shim is only needed if you use the default keys. no microsoft shim is needed if you use your own keys. it's all spelled out in quite some depth at https://safeboot.dev/ in a way that's more comprehensive than anywhere else I've found. Doesn't look like it's for the faint of heart, though.

[09:03:29] <SpiceMan> fwiw, it's a 109-key japanese keyboard, and the ibus-mozc system configuration uses "default" as keyboard layout

[09:06:44] <Bashing-om> SpiceMan: Worth making a bug report to get it resolved ?
[09:08:00] <SpiceMan> that page stating "how to setup Japanese input on an English Ubuntu installation." makes me think that they do consider that, so if you also choose Japanese as the system language, it maybe sets it properly

[14:59:41] <SaladTime> Alright, just did a system update and it's completely killed my laptops built-in display - just random flickering digital noise
[14:59:49] <SaladTime> 1.) wtf, why is this even a thing that can happen
[14:59:55] <SaladTime> 2.) This isn't the screen - windows boots fine
[15:00:13] <SaladTime> 3.) Not sure how it's the GPU drivers as an externally driven screen works fine
[15:00:22] <Jeremy31> amdgpu with 5.13 kernel?
[15:00:26] <SaladTime> Nope
[15:00:29] <SaladTime> NVidia
[15:00:39] <SaladTime> Just reinstalled the driver but didn't help
[15:00:59] <SaladTime> 5.13 kernel though
[15:01:19] <SaladTime> Oh hang on a second, it'd be an AMD integrated GPU
[15:01:22] <SaladTime> So, yes
[15:01:35] <SaladTime> Is this a known issue?
[15:01:41] <Jeremy31> Using 5.11 before?
[15:01:48] <SaladTime> Not entirely sure but I suspect so
[15:02:18] <ogra> you should be able to go back to the former kernel to verify it is the kernel update
[15:02:47] <ogra> just intercept the boot at the bootloader so you can select the kernel from its menu
[15:03:05] <SaladTime> I can likely do this, have done before - but once I do that, what's my next step?
[15:03:09] <SaladTime> Just sit at 5.11?
[15:03:18] <SaladTime> Isn't this a fairly major issue for Ubuntu?
[15:03:30] <ogra> nah, just verify that it is really a 5.13 issue before moving forward with anything

[15:17:55] <SaladTime> I'd prefer to do this without also nuking cuda
[15:18:11] <ogra> cuda ? wheer did you get it from ?
[15:18:46] <SaladTime> Can't remember honestly, but it's not something that'd cause this
[15:18:56] <ogra> (i dont think there are recent CUDA libs in the archive)
[15:19:02] <SaladTime> Probably the official nvidia cuda site
[15:19:37] <ogra> yeah, not sure, but if your driver gets updated and you have libs that wont work with that particular driver version it might cause issues
[15:19:48] <SaladTime> It could definitely break cuda yeah
[15:19:57] <SaladTime> But shouldn't break general display stuff

[15:20:05] <ogra> how do you knwo ?

[16:15:07] <zamba> i'm using SSDs.. and the server has 128GB RAM and 32 vCPUs @ 2.3 GHz
[16:15:47] <tomreyn> debug what exactly?
[16:16:16] <zamba> tomreyn: why it's consuming that much resources
[16:16:26] <tomreyn> oh your sftp-server?
[16:16:30] <zamba> yes
[16:17:05] <tomreyn> hmm, i guess you can run sshd in the foreground
[16:17:17] <zamba> the problem is that i have a nfs server running on top of the same storage and that is heavily loaded.. so i'm getting terrible performance across the nfs share whenever i'm writing to the same data store over sftp
[16:17:47] <tomreyn> "-D      When this option is specified, sshd will not detach and does not become a daemon.  This allows easy monitoring of sshd."
[16:17:55] <tomreyn> from the sshd man page

[23:00:22] <Guest7> I often setup single purpose servers... like a $10 Pi to run my VPN, and I'll have a separate $10 Pi to run a print server. Is there any reason not to just login as root? It's saves a minute during setup. And similarly, is there any reason to not have all files in the home directory? Like, why bother with any more of a file structure when there is
[23:00:23] <Guest7> such a simple setup? Everything I read seems to suggest against these practices, but the literature seems written with more traditional setups in mind, where you want to isolate users and different processes on the machine.

[23:16:12] <CodeMouse92> Oops, sorry to the other guests, LOL
[23:17:20] <jhutchins> CodeMouse92: sudo su is generally not recommended, sudo -i or similar is preferred.
[23:17:32] <CodeMouse92> jhutchins: Interesting. Reason?
[23:18:13] <jhutchins> CodeMouse92: I'm not entirely clear on it myself, but it has to do with the layers of shells that are ivoked and the resources consumed.
[23:18:17] * CodeMouse92 never did like trying to remember how to 'su' into another user other than root anyway
[23:18:51] <CodeMouse92> I mean, I'll switch, but as a rule I don't subscribe to rules that don't have explanations attached. That's how we got "change your password every month"
[23:18:54] <jhutchins> CodeMouse92: Occasionally sudo gets lost in the identities, paths, and permissions (especially if used in scripts).
[23:19:08] <CodeMouse92> jhutchins: Ah, valid
[23:19:48] <jhutchins> CodeMouse92: When I have to administer a multi-user system, I do find su - <user> very useful.  I've never used the system in a way that makes su without - useful.
[23:20:14] <CodeMouse92> jhutchins: But, to be fair, sudo -i <user> works too, so...
[23:20:19] <CodeMouse92> Hah, did we just switch positions?
