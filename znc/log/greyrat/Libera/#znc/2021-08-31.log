[13:56:30] <predicament> it's a little different this time.  Out of four networks, 3 work PWless (SASL EXT) and the other time i connect to my ZNC on this other network... *me flips finger* .. nothin
[13:56:34] <predicament> cant do pwless.
[13:57:03] <predicament> i've tried very hard to get the cert right, everything is pointed where it should be, it is followed to a T, and I know it can be the network sometimes/the ircd
[13:57:29] <predicament> sometimes different certs have to be generated with different CN for that specific network if im not mistaken
[13:57:40] <predicament> just as something to try.  i did that as well
[13:58:53] <predicament> i um.. i then went to more advanced stuff, i think i did by accident.  right now it's all pointed at znc.pem and i appended some stuff to it.  priv.pem and something else taht i forget.
[13:59:06] <predicament> not 'more advanced'
[13:59:54] <predicament> not really.  it's a damn .conf file.  sorry for my scrambled explanation but i think you guys get the idea.. so are there any other suggestions aside from all of the information i read (yes, i read everything as far as I can see)
[14:00:00] <predicament> about this, anyway
[14:00:07] <predicament> sorry for all the typing.
[14:02:16] <predicament> ugh. crap.  i'm sorry.  i feel dumb.  like i can do /quote pass p and it connects with this network and two or three others with the certs i made 
[14:02:58] <predicament> but not one of them.  justachatter is what it's called.  i'm not sure if that's relevant.
[14:04:27] <predicament> i just appended the right things to znc.pem because it needs to be there for the web interface, so i made sure that stayed 'valid' and i know it doesnt matter, but if i can make it valid.. i just OCD abiout that part
[14:04:47] <predicament> which i did
[14:05:45] <predicament> im probably missing something.  but i really did do my best guys.  sorry i came up short.  there arent any other issues, but i enjoy auto login -_-

[14:29:02] <predicament> i mean it did still technically say "ohy ou need a pw" when i connect to my znc.  but again, thats with using sasl ext tls so um.. it seems maybe this other ircd, justachatter or wahtever.. im guessing either it only selects plain text and asks for hte entire PW and network name and all that
[14:29:10] <predicament> i dont need to do any of thawt with the others, just fast typing
[14:29:41] <predicament> and i did the same sequences and it was the most updated version, Drsomebody, he had 88 or something in his name
[14:29:45] <predicament> he helped a lot
[14:29:52] <predicament> he was very friendly to me.
[14:30:53] <predicament> i looked at cert and certauth, added them, re-did them, made sure they are listed precisely as they are in hexchat
[14:31:40] <predicament> with the certs/ dir added.  So if it's literally named "idiot-ZNC" then you type it  like that and it's case sensitive when you generate it

[15:41:24] <predicament> im not saying it isnt me
[15:42:15] <predicament> but i believe it's between my client and ZNC, just cannot figure out why.  if it's the network, then i can't do anything until my friend fixes up the ircd which i wish he'd just hand over to me.. already did justachatter.com
[15:42:37] <predicament> that's the network's name, if that is relevant at all
[15:42:43] <predicament> not advertising.
[15:43:51] <predicament> i followed exactly even as CertFP said, which the wiki does lead you to when you're pretty much finished.
[15:44:02] <predicament> wait a minute.  i added a user certificate...
[15:44:08] <predicament> i was going network by network..

[20:54:43] <A_Dragon> DarthGandalf: if I modify an outgoing (OnClientMessage) message, specifically a PRIVMSG, and its now longer than 512 on the wire, what happens?
[20:56:21] <DarthGandalf> The server may truncate or reject it
[20:57:09] <A_Dragon> so znc itself wont do anything to prevent that?
[20:57:32] <DarthGandalf> AFAIR no
[20:57:49] <A_Dragon> sorry I used the wrong name. OnSendToClientMessage, so znc -> client
[20:57:54] <A_Dragon> but I assume the answer is the same
[20:58:15] <DarthGandalf> no
[20:58:25] <DarthGandalf> the *client* may truncate or reject it :)
[20:58:39] <A_Dragon> yeah thats what I guessed. fine Ill have to *actually do housekeeping*
[20:59:03] <DarthGandalf> what are you doing?
[20:59:25] <DarthGandalf> <A_Dragon> DarthGandalf: I want access to the STATUSMSG isupport token contents
[20:59:29] <DarthGandalf> I mean, the bigger picture
[20:59:34] <Swant> DarthGandalf, fixing my client :p
[20:59:36] <DarthGandalf> What it's all about?
[20:59:58] <A_Dragon> DarthGandalf: wrapping STATUSMSG messages such that they are normal PRIVMSGs with modified messages, rather than with a prefixed target
[21:00:35] <A_Dragon> ie /msg @#chan is transpated to :source PRIVMSG #chan :[@] {original_message}
[21:00:53] <A_Dragon> Swant: hexchat does that silliness too, tbf
[21:01:14] <Swant> DarthGandalf, basically I offhandedly mentioned that https://github.com/MCMrARM/revolution-irc/issues/269 causes my phone to blow up any time #libera is +mz, I've been meaning to hack something together a la https://wiki.znc.in/Identifymsg for ages because it kills me but haven't due to time
[21:01:30] <Swant> and now apparently A_Dragon has very kindly taken on that task

[21:20:28] <Swant> I just noticed a curious thing with log and STATUSMSG, messages sent to @# seem to end up in #<channel>/<date>.log (with no indication they were sent as STATUSMSG's) whereas messages sent to +# end up in +#<channel>/<date>.log. that feels odd, or am I doing something wrong?

[22:41:34] <A_Dragon> DarthGandalf: incase something in future changes there, either or works, its a `pass` which becomes a None which becomes CONTINUE afaik?
