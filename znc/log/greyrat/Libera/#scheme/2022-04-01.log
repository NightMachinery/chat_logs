[12:50:20] <amazigh> re theseb question about invocations of macros, my understanding of the question is what are the important steps / milestones when processing scheme source code
[12:51:37] <amazigh> compile time steps, can be done at runtime steps in the case of a interpreter.
[12:55:19] <amazigh> At compile time, the source is read, including dependencies ie. libraries, that is 'expand' time, during that step libraries are gathered, both macro definitions (define-syntax, let-syntax) are read, and ready to be applied, and regular procedure (define, let, ...), the latter is necessary because a macro can execute a procedure introduced by a `define`
[12:58:29] <amazigh> at compile time, during expansion, the implementation will go through all macro applications e.g. (my-macro foo bar baz), and execute the code associated with my-macro passing the arguments as syntax objects (the syntax object may relate any type of atom), and hence (my-macro ...) is *transformed* into what the macro defines.
[12:58:42] <amazigh> that is the invokation of ast transformer, a macro.
[13:00:09] <amazigh> when all macro applications are processed, it is possible for the implementation to produce a standalone representation of the program.
[13:00:21] <amazigh> without macro definitions, or applications.
[13:02:04] <amazigh> when the resulting code is executed, that is at runtime, there is no more ast transformers in the sense of scheme's define-macro, syntax-rule, syntax-case, explicit or implicit renaming etc...?
[13:03:42] <amazigh> so, at expand-time, hence compile time, (my-macro foo bar baz) was transformed by `my-macro`, into `(display (format "hello ~a, ~a, and ~a" foo bar baz))`, that is the latter that will be invoked that is the latter that will be invoked.
[13:04:29] <amazigh> sorry typo in ^: so, at expand-time, hence compile time, (my-macro foo bar baz) was transformed by `my-macro`, into `(display (format "hello ~a, ~a, and ~a" foo bar baz))`, that is the latter that will be invoked *AT RUNTIME*.
[13:05:34] <amazigh> (also it is imo significant to add inside parentheses that libraries, are "packed" at expand time, hence at compile time, otherwise said, library machinery is part of the expander)
[13:08:07] <amazigh> the astute reader will figure that a compiler need to evaluate scheme code as part of macro applications at compile time.
[13:09:22] <amazigh> mainstream understanding is that evaluation is different from compilation.. but in scheme in the presence of syntax-case, arbitrary scheme expression can appear in the definition of ast transformers.
[13:10:08] <amazigh> see stalin for an example compiler without an expand time step.
[13:11:49] <amazigh> as usual everything, I wrote is subject to feedbacks, critics, corrections.

[15:42:12] <mdhughes> littlebobeep: You can make GUIs with Scheme, but it requires impl-specific libraries.
[15:42:43] <mdhughes> I use SDL2 from Thunderchez. There's a much more complete (but kinda slow) gui library in Racket.
[15:43:53] <mdhughes> Often the only solution is to write FFI from Scheme to C, set up/control your GUI in C code. But all your program logic can stay in Scheme.
[15:44:37] <mdhughes> Kawa and Clojure can use Java's AWT, Swing, JavaFX.
[15:45:30] <mdhughes> CHICKEN has a bunch of poorly-maintained GUIs, and SDL2. I don't know the current state of those, but I wasn't happy making end-user GUIs in CHICKEN a couple years ago.
[15:45:53] *** Quits: zacque (~zacque@1.32.90.32) (Quit: Goodbye :D)
[15:46:23] <sham1> CHICKEN probably could bind to gtk quite easily
[15:46:55] <mdhughes> You'd think, but not AFAIK. http://eggs.call-cc.org/5/#graphics
[15:47:21] <mdhughes> http://eggs.call-cc.org/5/#ui
[15:49:51] <mdhughes> gtk-server is slow, but it works. webview is an OK solution, no idea how performant it is.
[15:51:20] <mdhughes> If I was gonna ship end-user non-games, I'd use Racket's gui, and just hope I didn't care about speed.
[15:53:39] <wasamasa> gtk-server is something more people should look into
[15:53:52] <wasamasa> most GUI applications don't need C binding levels of speed
[15:54:08] <wasamasa> so if you have an example demonstrating otherwise, show me
[15:54:39] <wasamasa> webview, well, you might as well make a web application, lol
[15:54:54] <wasamasa> you wouldn't be subject to the limitations of a webview library
[15:55:20] <wasamasa> like, one of the obstacles I ran into was SOP
[15:55:34] <mdhughes> I like UIs that aren't glacially slow. The rule of thumb from the old days is 0.1s or less response time to anything except raw key/mouse events, and those need to be 0.01s or less. And gtk-server can't do that.
[15:56:03] <wasamasa> so, where's your example showing those measurements
[15:56:39] <mdhughes> yeah, let me do a lot of work to prove what I know from other comments and uses of it.
[15:56:53] <wasamasa> so you do not have firsthand experience, got it
[15:56:56] <mdhughes> You think it's nice, stand up a demo program with timers.
[15:57:07] <wasamasa> I ported all the interesting demo programs
[15:57:11] <wasamasa> I did enough work I think
[15:57:15] <mdhughes> I have used one, I was unpleased. Didn't poke into it further.
[16:00:38] <wasamasa> I ran into the SOP thing I mentioned when porting an epub viewer demo from the webkit to the webview egg
[16:01:20] <wasamasa> my strategy was just pointing to HTML on the file system and combining with HTML/CSS/JS files from a different file system location and that got blocked
[16:01:33] <mdhughes> … Looked, I nuked my gtk-server compile, which *sucked* to set up on Mac.
[16:01:47] <wasamasa> so I looked up how webview users solve that and found they write a web server that serves all content
[16:02:11] <mdhughes> That's correct, you have to use a local server for content.
[16:02:27] <wasamasa> which made me think, why even bother with webview at this point
[16:02:33] <mdhughes> Typically just python -m http.server is good enough.
[16:02:38] <wasamasa> why not write a proper web application
[16:02:59] <mdhughes> Sometimes I do that, but JS is ugly, and can't talk to the filesystem.
[16:03:57] <sham1> IMO unless the application is fully about presentation (like a video game, and even then there is variance there), the application logic probably should be partially if not fully separated from the presentation layer
[16:03:58] <mdhughes> So if you work in a nice native language (or Node if you're masochistic), you can do all your actual-computing work, and the front end does the GUI and talks to you over FFI or a socket (slow).
[16:04:04] <sham1> So one could have different frontends
[16:04:33] <wasamasa> that's a cool idea, but how useful is it in practice?
[16:04:39] <wasamasa> I mean, look at fucking emacs
[16:04:51] <wasamasa> they hamfisted GUI support on top of pretending it's still a terminal application
[16:05:17] <sham1> Well that model certainly works. I mean, look at REST applications where the actual logic is on the server and the transport just gives the frontend the data
[16:05:29] <mdhughes> Electron and every web framework works that way.
[16:06:02] <wasamasa> they do, but my questions is how often you need more than one frontend
[16:06:19] <mdhughes> JS on the front-end isn't *awful*, but the trick is doing as little up there as you can, so your logic is in a nicer back-end.
[16:06:33] <wasamasa> it's kind of like scheme newbies are led to believe they need to write portable code just in case they need to switch implementations
[16:07:12] <mdhughes> You kind of do? Your first guess at what impl works for you is often wrong.
[16:08:18] <wasamasa> followed by the realization that actually switching implementations is annoying
[16:08:20] <mdhughes> I try to isolate all my impl-specific stuff, but I've got lazy about that, a bunch of my code won't build on CHICKEN now, Chez only.
[16:08:41] <wasamasa> I believe it's worrying too early
[16:10:31] <wasamasa> what I'm asserting is that the approach of agonizing what to pick and writing suboptimal code is worse than the approach of picking one, realizing there's a better option and rewriting the bit of code you wrote
[16:12:28] <sham1> Well my point is that the point of having multiple frontends would also be a boon due to you also being able to use whatever language in the backend instead of being forced to write with the language of the frontend
[16:12:34] <mdhughes> Sure, none of the Schemes are that hard to port to. Pick the impl that has the tools you want right now, but it's good to isolate your impl-specific code.
[16:14:14] <mdhughes> I can use most of my graphics code from any of Chez, CHICKEN, some works in Gerbil & Racket, because marklib-graphics is per-impl.

[16:30:46] <mdhughes> You don't need to write any C, it's just a direct translation of the SDL2 APIs. Just shove the dylibs in a directory, load them at program startup, and you can call SDL2.
[16:32:56] <mdhughes> I did in the end write some C, because the SDL2 audio API is just appallingly bad and it's easier to wrap it from C and FFI to my functions, but it wasn't mandatory.

[20:27:16] <Zipheir> Hah.
[20:27:17] <johnjaye> when one says R7RS-large is "large" does that mean in number of libraries or in features
[20:27:29] <johnjaye> for example common lisp has 'features' like multiple inheritance that scheme may reject
[20:27:33] <Zipheir> Probably just "not -small".
[20:28:02] <johnjaye> a thousand libraries are worth a single reserved keyword
[20:28:12] <Zipheir> Hmm.
[20:29:19] <Zipheir> johnjaye: So far, it's just libraries, but there are some new "core features" as well.  It's a little hard to draw that line in language design.
[20:30:05] <mdhughes> "I'm going to do something in Javascript!" Now you have two problems.
[20:30:10] <johnjaye> i've never designed a language. but my impression is common lisp has a bunch of super specific features about streams or something that aren't relevant anymore
[20:30:18] <johnjaye> but they're built into the core language. vs a library you can add later
[20:30:25] <sham1> Especially considering that the standard library is specified alongside the core language 
[20:30:34] <johnjaye> maybe every age of computing needs its specific paradigms hardcoded into the language features
[20:31:02] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Have you seen The Great Quux's "How to Grow a Language" talk?
[20:31:20] <edgar-rft> my question was more meant like: when I print out R7RS-large, will it have more than 1200 pages?
[20:31:24] <johnjaye> nope. sounds like the title of one of those Strangeloop talks that see sometimes
[20:31:44] <sham1> Common Lisp has some weird anachronisms, like how a char has its numeric value in the given encoding and also some extended attributes which were meant for lisp machines mostly to enable chars to carry font metadata and such 
[20:31:45] <Zipheir> It's from a long time ago, when he was best known for working on Java.
[20:31:47] <Zipheir> One sec.
[20:32:27] <sham1> I'm sure that R7-Large will also have such, as probably do R6 and R7-small
[20:32:38] <Zipheir> johnjaye: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6TaiXzHAE  It's a great talk.  Try to figure out what he's doing with English before he explains it.
[20:33:26] <Zipheir> Oh yes, and he also says Scheme was the best language he's ever tried to design.
[20:33:43] <johnjaye> i got OOPSLA conference: growing a language on my phone. but i cannot see the URL to tell if it's the same as what you posted
[20:34:01] <Zipheir> That sounds right.
[20:34:30] <johnjaye> the thing is as you probably know the main division between scheme community and others is about philosophy. scheme has always been about educating and having a simple lisp core
[20:34:46] <johnjaye> which is great. but you need the 'industrial' features to have a practical language for large scale stuff
[20:35:20] <sham1> And due to the process of discovery, it does seem that we've landed on a formula that gives both
[20:35:36] <Zipheir> The problem IMO is that that feature-set has and continues to grow at an amazing rate.
[20:36:02] <Zipheir> The "big" languages of the late 80s (e.g. Ada) now look tiiiiny.

[20:53:11] <Zipheir> amazigh: Agreed, though, that it takes years of just working and experimenting to "mature".
[20:53:57] <johnjaye> Zipheir: probably a little bit of both.
[20:54:23] <johnjaye> arguably the entire point of a university system is to objectively qualify expertise. or should anyway
[20:55:12] <edgar-rft> right, people creating nothing than shit are creative, too :-)

[20:58:42] <johnjaye> i've seen people charge $200 to talk to them for 15 minutes on skype
[20:58:56] <johnjaye> it's purely a market-driven thing in some cases
[20:59:23] <amazigh> the point is not about picasso being a famous artist, but about the fact that all work that matters takes time (whether that napkin drawin matters is highly subjective like any form of art (btw art is not only a physical artifact, the result of banksy work goes beyond paintings on a walls, imo is the equivalent of butterfly-that-triggers a tornado far away in social norms etc..)

[21:01:57] <Zipheir> amazigh: Right.  The hard part IME is being willing to make mistakes for years/decades to get to that point.
[21:02:09] <amazigh> true
[21:02:20] <amazigh> wasamasa: growing in my circle of friends :)
[21:02:31] <wasamasa> ok
[21:02:40] <wasamasa> I was about to ask whether it's some global phenomenon
[21:02:47] <edgar-rft> everybody hates me because I'm a hero
[21:03:20] <johnjaye> wasamasa: don't worry, mha will still be popular. like really popular. for a long time
[21:03:37] <wasamasa> I don't even know what that is
[21:03:42] <wasamasa> does it involve frogs?
[21:03:51] <Zipheir> Sometimes you hear people say that "they could paint just like Jackson Pollock", but they can't, because Jackson Pollock spent 25 years trying to paint traditionally before he picked up the paint-hurling stick.
[21:04:28] <johnjaye> wasamasa: there is a popular anime about super heroes. yes really.

[21:04:59] <Franciman> Zipheir: do you happen to know where call/cc Operator C is introduced?
[21:05:52] *** Quits: epony (epony@user/epony) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:06:00] <edgar-rft> I can paint like Jackson Pollock when he was 5 years old
[21:06:32] <gwatt> Zipheir: supposedly the CIA helped push Jackson Pollock to help combat Soviet influence. somehow.
[21:06:36] <Zipheir> Franciman: Er, in what?
[21:06:50] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[21:07:12] <Zipheir> gwatt: That's hard to believe, he was apparently incredibly hard to work with.
[21:07:39] <Franciman> Zipheir: uhm operator C, i think is the name given to continuations by Filinski
[21:07:43] <Franciman> but i can't find the paper anymore
[21:07:48] <Zipheir> Oh, hm.
[21:07:54] <mnieper> There are different measures one can use to measure the number of features of a language.  Although the spec of R4RS is much smaller than the one of, say, C99, it is in some way much easier to interpret C99 in Scheme than the other way round.  Scheme has proper tail calls, C does not.
[21:08:27] <mnieper> So I would remove all the syntactic sugar and library stuff from a language and compare what's left.
[21:08:32] <Zipheir> Franciman: From "Abstracting Control" or "Representing Control"?
[21:08:54] <Franciman> thanks
[21:09:06] <Zipheir> I'm asking, I don't know 8-)
[21:09:08] <amazigh> Continuing on painting, I find the following diagram of skills, actual skills, frustration very enlightening https://cdn.masto.host/floss/cache/media_attachments/files/108/051/882/180/880/021/small/1d6453d1e5839c8d.png more interesting that the troll meme we see all around about coding.
[21:09:10] <gwatt> Zipheir: I'm not sure on the particulars, not being up on my art history, but it's a claim I've seen repeated several times. Also, at the height of the cold war the CIA did all kinds of wacky things, so supporting Pollock isn't *that* far out
[21:09:33] <johnjaye> there were many many crazy things that happened in the course of the cold war.

[21:10:00] <johnjaye> that's kind of the point. you can't fight a hot war, so you just fight intermediate low-level wars in third countries. who don't particularly appreciate it either.

Get a job for the delusional painter named hammond too. he got aids from keshi.

[21:13:36] <Zipheir> Sadly, the Wikipedia page on Pollock, a dead person, doesn't include a single painting due to copyright.  It does have a photo of his studio's floor, though, which might look like one of his paintings to some. :)
[21:14:01] <wasamasa> lol
[21:16:16] <Franciman> and it's called J, not C
[21:16:22] <Franciman> hell, I'm delusional
[21:16:23] <ChoHag> But his unfortunate kids might not be able to squeeze more millions out of people if any old riff-raff could see them.
[21:17:09] <ChoHag> Won't somebody think of the millionaires?
[21:17:23] <amazigh> Franciman: what are you speaking about?
[21:17:33] <amazigh> Franciman: is that J the language?
[21:18:10] <Franciman> no J is sort of call/cc
[21:18:22] <amazigh> good name /s
