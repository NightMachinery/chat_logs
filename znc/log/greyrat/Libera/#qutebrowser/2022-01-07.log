[00:14:13] <leo_rockway> hello. Is there a way to get a list of URLs of all open tabs? I used to be able to do that with :buffer
[00:14:59] <The-Compiler> leo_rockway: :buffer got renamed to :tab-selec
[00:15:02] <The-Compiler> select*
[00:16:40] <leo_rockway> thank you. I didn't realize that tab-select without arguments behaved in the same way as buffer. I should've tried that. Thanks!
[00:17:29] <The-Compiler> oh to be fair I forgot too
[00:17:37] <leo_rockway> heh
[00:17:59] <The-Compiler> guess that one doesn't make too much sense since the rename...
[00:18:18] <leo_rockway> I just watched a video on how to write userscripts (the Qutebrowser kind, not Greasemonkey) and it's really neat. Now I wish I had a need to write one, but I cannot think of anything!

[02:35:52] <blaub> The-Compiler: yeah, already tried that, though it needs a restart
[02:37:26] <The-Compiler> (continuing from #archlinux, for the curious)
[02:37:40] <The-Compiler> blaub: yeah, because under the hood it also just passes those commandline arguments to Chromium
[02:37:51] <blaub> ah okey
[02:38:10] <blaub> so you cant restart "embedded" chromium without qutebrowser?
[02:38:18] <The-Compiler> correct
[02:38:49] <blaub> weird, is there no "unmount" mechanism in qt?
[02:39:25] <The-Compiler> what would that do?
[02:39:41] <blaub> restarting chromium :)
[02:40:00] <The-Compiler> then no :D
[02:40:21] <The-Compiler> management of the underlying Chromium is pretty much abstracted over by QtWebEngine, for better or worse
[02:40:33] <The-Compiler> AFAIK stuff gets started the first time you use it, for the most part
[02:41:01] <blaub> still haven't seen any instabilties yet, like some people have mentioned
[02:41:30] <blaub> maybe i'm using the browser wrong :)
[02:41:39] <The-Compiler> there is one bug somewhere (outside of qutebrowser, likely) which results in a corrupted service worker cache, causing crashes
[02:41:55] <The-Compiler> removing that cache helps, but the crash dialog doesn't suggest that - it probably should
[02:42:03] <The-Compiler> but too much on my plate :D
