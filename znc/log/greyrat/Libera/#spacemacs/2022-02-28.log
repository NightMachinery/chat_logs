[22:54:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> > but I shouldn't be expected to know the depths of my EDITOR of choice ‚èé  ‚èé that's exactly the reason I suggest you to use *nix. There's not much gain on spending your time tinkering helm-backup when you can conveniently circumvent the issue.
[22:58:38] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> @lebensterben: if you want to, and have time, you can pick up my edits of helm-backup and I'm sure you will do a better job, possibly even making it work for both unix and windows.. (not that you even need my edits, as im sure you can do it by yourself) I do think that backup system is quite elegant, simple and useful.
[23:05:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Please open an issue for feature request.
[23:07:46] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> sounds good!
[23:07:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the design of helm-clone requires helm and git. helm can be replaced by other completion system, and is not essential. ‚èé  ‚èé git is essential here.
[23:08:48] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> true... though that could be listed as a dependency, right ? and is easy to install on windows and linux
[23:08:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if helm is not a must to you, you have much more choices, see https://melpa.org/#/?q=backup
[23:09:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I'd argue that backing up each save is sufficient for many use cases.
[23:10:28] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> tbh, i use helm because i believe was the recommended (or default) by spacemacs, and i've never used emacs before spacemacs
[23:10:40] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> though i do like the git integration
[23:11:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> for example, backup-each-save is uttely simple but that makes it more compatible on various platform.

[23:14:01] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> thanks for that link too, i normally dont even know where to look for extra packages that are not from a spacemacs layer (google gives some results though normally not the best)
[23:15:09] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but git integration seems like an overkill for me.
[23:15:55] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> understood... i guess i like it because it keeps a small footprint and no need for multiple files in the directory as you can just roll the history
[23:16:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I may save a file several times per minute. That means git will keep a very large amount of history...
[23:18:55] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> hypothetically if I'm writing a backup system, I will simply save the file for a fixed interval of time, say every 5 minutes. ‚èé I won't use git but I need to provide user an interface to preview the file change history similar to "git-diff".
[23:19:13] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> true, with small deltas... and compressed, while if you backup on each save you create a file copy everytime
[23:19:25] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> That's pretty similar to what you get from Time Machine on bugOS
[23:19:45] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> i like git because it does not need to make a full copy of the file every time
[23:21:20] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> maybe you'd write that delta system too
[23:24:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> okay. if you want delta backups, you can use a real incremental backup system...
[23:24:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> for example, duplicati is cross-platform.
[23:39:04] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Any idea why a given python file (someone else's, with poor formatting) keeps indenting 5 spaces instead of 4?  A new python file indents correctly.  Does spacemacs automagically stick to the existing formatting of a given file?
