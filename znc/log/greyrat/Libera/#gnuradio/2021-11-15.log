[00:09:22] <willcode4[m]> Hash: Careful which ZMQ types you use in different situations. Some are load sharing, so block until there is a response, etc.
[00:09:59] <Hash[m]> Yea, I was sending messages back and forth to unblock, it was ridiculous :) 
[00:10:18] <Hash[m]> PUSH/PULL works great for me so far
[00:15:47] <matt_mills[m]> pub/sub allows y ou to have multiple subscribers (consumers) of the same publisher, which is handy if you want to distribute 1 set of data to multiple things
[00:16:06] <matt_mills[m]> I use pub/sub for channelization of RX
[00:16:28] <matt_mills[m]> so then I can hook another client, or a client that generates an FFT, or a debug client onto it without having any issues
[00:19:31] <Hash[m]>  like that for the debug aspect
[00:21:01] <matt_mills[m]> yeah it's also intended so I can stick an updating FFT into a webpage for an admin interface
[00:21:20] *** Quits: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@101.89.150.168) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:23:26] <matt_mills[m]> I also dump the raw RX data from the device to a pub sub IPC socket (http://api.zeromq.org/master:zmq-ipc) which requires some extra CPU, but is worth it for me to be able to access it as well
[00:24:05] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@218.78.109.69)
[00:27:21] <Hash[m]> I was using ipc to just send messages on my local machine from python script to my running flowgraph
[00:29:53] <matt_mills[m]> Yeah I just dumped all the RX data into it so I could add and remove chunks of flowgraph without stopping the primary device flowgraph, since I'm adding and removing stuff frequently and the small stop/start times were impactful
[00:30:24] <matt_mills[m]> So instead of reconfiguring the flowgraph I start a new one with a zmq subscriber pointed at the IPC socket for the right device
[00:30:45] <matt_mills[m]> then each downstream piece can do its own thing without causing any interruptions if it needs to add/remove blocks
[00:35:36] <muaddib[m]> <matt_mills[m]> "yeah it's also intended so I can..." <- I like that even better. What web interface are you using? I worked a lot with BOKEHGUI on GNURadio  3.7, But haven’t picked it back up yet as it was pretty buggy.
[00:36:18] <matt_mills[m]> I haven't really gotten around to developing that part yet, but it was for my own stuff not generic 
[00:37:05] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: Gotcha. There’s a lot of stuff out there already. I’m just not that familiar with the web GUI side of things. 
[00:37:17] <matt_mills[m]> I mean I made the FFT vector, I assume I'll just have an ajax call that makes it available as a javascript array and use a JS charting library
[00:37:32] <matt_mills[m]> it doesn't need to be super fancy, just something to say "yep, the antenna is plugged in"
[00:37:40] <muaddib[m]> you just mentioned 3 things i have little to no experience with :D 
[00:38:38] <muaddib[m]> I think that's true for my use as well. i took some stuff from ham2mon and made a pretty cool low data rate wide band remote visualizer, but it required GNURadio on both ends. was hoping to get the user end to a web UI
[00:39:16] <muaddib[m]> i could view 40MHz at a pretty fluid rate. no problem over a 1MB link.
[00:39:26] <muaddib[m]> Barry Duggan: has a cool project he did too
[00:39:28] <matt_mills[m]> just googling words I see there is something like this: https://github.com/jledet/waterfall
[00:39:32] <BarryDuggan[m]> Hash: it's not the wiki, but look at this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duggabe/gr-webserver/master/examples/zmq_PUSH_PULL_server.py
[00:39:32] <matt_mills[m]> which would work fine
[00:41:20] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills: this is really great, thank you! i honestly haven't done my 'googling words' on this as it's back burner, but i'm glad to see this as something i could use.
[00:41:34] <muaddib[m]> right after i try Barry Duggan 's web server D:
[00:41:38] <muaddib[m]> * web server :D
[00:41:53] <matt_mills[m]> yeah I'm sure you could find a lot of open source stuff out there now
[00:42:34] <matt_mills[m]> although it would be pretty interesting to see if GRC could be implemented in a web UI :D
[00:43:19] <BarryDuggan[m]> iirc, a GSoC student updated BOKEHGUI in 2020
[00:43:34] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: have you seen gr-bokehgui?
[00:43:59] <matt_mills[m]> Yeah I mean the block connection side as well
[00:44:00] <muaddib[m]> the examples were minimal, but freaking awesome
[00:44:18] <muaddib[m]> oh i gotcha
[00:44:30] <muaddib[m]> like being able to manually create the graph in the GUI?
[00:44:47] <matt_mills[m]> with some kind of preconfigured source that isn't changeable if it's shared
[00:44:55] <matt_mills[m]> yeah
[00:45:10] <matt_mills[m]> and all the gui blocks re-implemented in javascript/canvas with data coming over websockets 
[00:45:18] <matt_mills[m]> and processing done on the far side
[00:56:13] <muaddib[m]> right right, we have the remote processing/local viewing as a shared goal for sure. I also like the 'remote design' idea. I guess i never thought of it as something i'd want to do, but that could be really cool. 
[00:57:10] <matt_mills[m]> it'd be really cool, and it'd be really useful for getting people who aren't going to try to setup an executable
[00:57:27] <matt_mills[m]> like to just quickly mess around with a signal source and some blocks, it'd be a great tool
[01:01:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> Might be useful for a classroom situation.  Otherwise, SCP your flow-graph to the remote platform and run it....
[01:02:10] <matt_mills[m]> well yeah, I think anyone that knows how to SCP would be happy to do that, but there are plenty for whom SCP'ing is a scary and dangerous sounding thing
[01:02:12] <matt_mills[m]> :D
[01:02:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, SCPs are generally scary and dangerous
[01:02:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> matt_mills: /me mumbles under breath.

[01:03:09] <matt_mills[m]> anyone with a access to a webbrowser > anyone who can successfully setup linux and get GR installed
[01:03:29] <matt_mills[m]> not that I'm actually arguing that it should be done, since I'm probably not going to do it myself
[01:03:36] <matt_mills[m]> but it would be a cool way to open up access to more people
[01:04:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> "I want to be a DSP developer in SDR, but I'm afraid to learn anything even vaguely 'systemy'" doesn't sound like a long-term success recipe to me...
[01:04:53] <matt_mills[m]> Why does the goal need to be becoming a DSP developer tho?
[01:04:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> But i"m a grumpy old man, and I shoot the younglings playing on my lawn..... :)
[01:05:13] <matt_mills[m]> What if the goal is I want to understand what happens when I multiply two sine waves
[01:05:19] <matt_mills[m]>  or something moderately more complex
[01:06:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> matt_mills: I reluctantly agree that the "simulations" aspect might be a use case, but really, as soon as you move into "I want to kinda simulate real-world systems", you're heading squarely into DSP developer territory.
[01:06:30] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: HAHAHAHAHAH
[01:07:01] <DerekKozel[m]> I think making the current GNU Radio trivial to install solves the problem in most cases, and requires much smaller changes than reimplementing GRC onto a platform that almost none of the current users and devs have experience with.
[01:07:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: THIS
[01:07:36] <DerekKozel[m]> As a project GNU Radio is currently looking for funding to pay for work on the installers both of the core and the out of tree plugins
[01:07:55] <matt_mills[m]> yeah that's definitely an obvious problem, but hasn't "making gnuradio trivial to install" been the goal for years?
[01:07:57] <DerekKozel[m]> If we can raise that funding I'd hope that a year from now most of the install questions vanish
[01:08:22] <muaddib[m]> DerekKozel[m]: 
[01:08:23] <muaddib[m]> are you going to call it _not-pybombs_ :D
[01:08:35] <DerekKozel[m]> We're going to call it standard binary installers
[01:08:53] <muaddib[m]> DerekKozel[m]: hah, well done! I kid. 
[01:09:08] <muaddib[m]> muaddib[m]: <-- uses pybombs btw
[01:09:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> sudo apt install gnuradio gr-osmosdr    has produced a perfectly-working GR environment on Ubuntu 21.04 for me.  So, there's that...
[01:09:16] <DerekKozel[m]> It has definitely been a problem for a long time. It comes down to very few people wanting to volunteer to work on installers for systems other than Linux, and even on linux most OOT authors have no interest in ensuring they're packaged on different OSs
[01:09:41] <DerekKozel[m]> On Debian the installer situation is excellent, Fedora I've heard is good.
[01:09:56] <muaddib[m]> Derek Kozel: i always respected your optimism and hope for gnuradio windows, no joke seriously
[01:09:56] <DerekKozel[m]> Anywhere else it's just not getting the volunteer love it needs
[01:10:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Very few Linux devs are super-keem about doing packaging for the full set of Linuxes beyond those that they and their "customers" might be interested in.
[01:10:20] <DerekKozel[m]> I use GNU Radio almost solely on Windows at the moment, so it's getting so much better
[01:10:29] <DerekKozel[m]> :)
[01:10:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: Shoudl I call an exorcist?  
[01:10:55] <DerekKozel[m]> Eh, we need to train more EE students on using Linux
[01:11:06] <DerekKozel[m]> But I only have 9 weeks with them, so picking my battles

[01:14:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> Hey, I know one guy who thinks that it should be illegal (like jack-booted stormtroopers through your front door) to develop anything for open-source OS before developing for Windows.  He really was serious.  Also thought that OSS was within epsilon of communism, and should also itself be throw-you-in-the-gulag illegal.
[01:15:30] <DerekKozel[m]> Ha, I know one guy who thinks that it is philosophically evil to support anything on Windows that doesn't work on Linux first :P
[01:15:36] <Yamakaja[m]> Jeez, the red scare really did one over on him huh?

[01:16:08] <Yamakaja[m]> I can imagine
[01:16:26] <DerekKozel[m]> Good, reliable installers (with updating, multiple simultaneous installs) etc is a huge task and would make probably the single biggest difference to the usability and growth of GNU Radio
[01:16:32] <DerekKozel[m]> In my opinion! ^^
[01:16:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: Can't argue.
[01:16:49] <Hash[m]> I agree with early & easy accessibility... 
[01:17:04] <DerekKozel[m]> Then followed by developer guides for authoring OOT modules on each platform using the "standard" tooling for that OS
[01:17:25] <Hash[m]> Absolutely
[01:17:37] <DerekKozel[m]> There's an endless laundry list past that, but hopefully easier onboarding will lead to more developers will lead to more contributions
[01:18:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> Speaking of donors.  We can barely pay the rent at the moment...
[01:18:27] <Hash[m]> and installing other OOTs on that OS, if you can easily install GR, the other modules and write your own  more people can easily jump in and get hooked
[01:19:04] <Hash[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I got $5 on it
[01:19:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> We're hoping that once the CBC thing publishes, we can approach some deep-pocketed folks who might have seen it.
[01:20:49] <Hash[m]> Will definitely help as part of a pitch
[01:21:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> For U$10,000/year we could both pay the rent, and engage in some more-costly projects.  That might sound like a lot for some folks, but for the deeply-pocketed, it's head-scratchings.
[01:21:37] <matt_mills[m]> you know...
[01:22:11] <matt_mills[m]> Have you guys (GR) applied for funding from ARDC?
[01:22:42] <matt_mills[m]> They sold a portion of the ham radio IP allocation for $LOTS$ and have been doing hardcore grantmaking
[01:23:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> We (CCERA) have been looking into that.  My fundraising guy, however, is really bad at proposals and paperwork and the like :(
[01:24:00] <matt_mills[m]> I talked to them for my stuff and it sounded like they were interested if I could mitigate some of the patent issues (OP25), so I'd bet they'd jump on it
[01:24:32] <matt_mills[m]> and I did the math on the IP space they sold, and they have a looooot of funding to spend
[01:25:39] <DerekKozel[m]> We (GNU Radio) received some funding from the ARDC and it helped keep the lights on the last two years. We're definitely applying for a more significant grant from ARDC for the above work
[01:25:50] <matt_mills[m]> ah cool
[01:25:59] <DerekKozel[m]> ARDC sponsored GNU Radio conference this year and attended in person.

[01:27:44] <DerekKozel[m]> Sure, email me and lets have a call? It's the best way to get info from my brain in any sort of reasonable timeframe
[01:28:15] <DerekKozel[m]> It's surprisingly hard to do that well/effectively.
[01:29:01] <DerekKozel[m]> Non-profits in the US for instance can end up in a lot of trouble if they have only a single large funding source.
[01:29:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> matt_mills: We're going to go after some Mackenzie Scott money as well :)
[01:29:01] <matt_mills[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I'm sure Derek knows more, but TBH they seemed VERY approachable, I just sent an email and said hey before I put much work into this, is this something you guys would be interested in and they had a technical person check things out and he sent me a nice list of here are possible issues, here's what we're interested in, if you could find a 501c3 to partner with that'd help a lot
[01:29:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Speaking of billionaires...
[01:29:40] <matt_mills[m]> (lucky)
[01:29:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Does ARDC fund non-US entities?
[01:29:56] <DerekKozel[m]> It can, though there are hoops and challenges
[01:30:11] <DerekKozel[m]> 501c3 equivalency is important
[01:30:24] <matt_mills[m]> Yeah I think they can do whatever they want really, but they'd prefer to do it in a particular way
[01:30:46] <DerekKozel[m]> They can't. They have a pretty strong set of rules from the IRA
[01:31:10] <matt_mills[m]> Hrm? They said to me that a partner 501c3 wasn't strictly necessary but it'd help a lot and provide more "comfort"
[01:31:24] <matt_mills[m]> maybe it's more that it limits the amounts?
[01:31:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: IRA?  Scarier than I thought :) :) :)
[01:31:35] <DerekKozel[m]> :P
[01:31:47] <DerekKozel[m]> Har har.
[01:31:55] <DerekKozel[m]> It isn't strictly necessary, but it makes things much simpler for them
[01:32:00] <matt_mills[m]> makes me wish I had applied for a /8 back in the day
[01:32:13] <DerekKozel[m]> equivalency can be something like a UK public university for instance

[01:33:34] <DerekKozel[m]> patchvonbraun: If you're a registered non-profit of any sort I think that'll make things pretty simple for the ARDC, but they're also really responsive to questions.

[01:38:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> I use it in Makefiles
[01:38:46] <DerekKozel[m]> So yes, anything that can generate a .grc YAML file can use the GRC core to generate the actual flowgraph application
[01:38:56] <matt_mills[m]> now I'm kind of curious if there is enough metadata in GRC already to build a functional interface with a little glue and some automation
[01:39:09] <DerekKozel[m]> Oh yeah
[01:39:38] <DerekKozel[m]> the block.yml files have everything needed to represent a block and the flowgraph .yml file isn't particularily complicated
[01:39:41] <matt_mills[m]> I mean, the gui blocks would still need to get figured out, but everything else
[01:40:09] <matt_mills[m]> drag and drop, connect with lines, dialog windows... 
[01:40:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've been harboring a desire to make a kind of higher-level thingy for laying out "experiments" in Radio Astronomy, with it generating GRC-readable .yml files.  But, I have an insufficient number of round tuits....
[01:41:30] <muaddib[m]>  matt_mills it's interesting that the convo went to amateur radio cause that's actually where i could see this being used more.
[01:42:25] <muaddib[m]> to patchvonbraun 's point, yes the whole "i wanna do dsp but not learn anything' attitude isn't really realistic, but plenty of amateur radio guys could implement the DSP concepts without having to be linux-savy 
[01:42:30] <DerekKozel[m]> patchvonbraun: We nearly did that as a summer intern project at SETI

[01:44:37] <matt_mills[m]> I've just been playing with https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html a lot and it's so useful, feels like something similar for GR that lets you link directly into a flowgraph would be so useful
[01:45:14] <matt_mills[m]> just for the wrapping your head around it factor

[01:53:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'll comment that the last time I tried gr-BokehGUI, the performance and reliability were horrific, so I did my own thing.
[01:53:29] <matt_mills[m]> I mean heck if you could cross compile some stuff with webasm that'd be crazy cool
[01:54:27] <DerekKozel[m]> https://twitter.com/marcnewlin/status/1359769063484915714
[01:54:34] <matt_mills[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I wonder why, I'll have to poke that with a stick and see
[01:54:40] <muaddib[m]> Derek Kozel: curious, what are your thoughts on the model  gr-bokehgui put in to play? I know it's not  full blown GRC design via web, i'm asking more cause it deviates from the C++/Python/YAML structure and adds in web elements. It was SO cool the first time i got it working, just wondering if you think that still falls outside of the GR Universe?
[01:55:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> I didn't do much of a deep-dive into it, because it just didn't work that well for me. I ended up using a Python-based web-server, with a lot of jquery and jquery-based plotting, etc.  Very application specific.
[01:56:13] <DerekKozel[m]> It doesn't deviate much though! It's still a standard YAML flowgraph file that renders underlying C++ code that's then executed. 
[01:56:17] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: i interfaced with the maintainer a while back and said i'd test his method. apparently it was at least buildable on 3.8, the issue becomes which version of Node you're using and it also used an older unmaintained Bokeh API
[01:56:44] <DerekKozel[m]> It just uses a different GUI toolkit that is rendered in a browser rather than as a native application
[01:57:46] <matt_mills[m]> I mean it doesn't really look like Bokeh is intended to be high frame rate animated, it looks like it's more for static or user-interactable charting... I've never used it though
[01:58:04] <muaddib[m]> DerekKozel[m]: yea, for sure. I think the GUI elements all had to be rewritten or modified to fit the bokeh . i VAGUELY remember it, but i think the GUI widgets were where you'd find different language in there.
[01:58:49] <DerekKozel[m]> All the GUI elements have to be rewritten for whatever target library you're using. We had WX and QT in parallel for a while
[01:59:09] <DerekKozel[m]> There are a few other ones that are around as OOT modules. I saw someone working with imGUI recently
[01:59:29] <matt_mills[m]> DerekKozel[m]: That's pretty much what I was thinking, I was thinking you'd copy the QT blocks and strip out all the GUI functionality and replace it with a websocket sink, then have a websocket and GUI implementation on the other side
[01:59:57] <DerekKozel[m]> That's basically Bokeh (at a high level)

[02:02:34] <muaddib[m]> Hash[m]: DUDE! awesome! can't wait to hear what happens!
[02:03:00] <DerekKozel[m]> Bed time here. But I want to leave on the note that I really would love to see some experiments with a Web GRC and/or Web GUI blocks and/or native web DSP execution
[02:03:24] <DerekKozel[m]> I think the last is a lot of work, but webassembly has been getting more impressive by the month.
[02:03:28] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@218.78.79.129)
[02:04:07] <matt_mills[m]> yeah web native DSP would be an extreme lot of work
[02:04:21] <matt_mills[m]> definitely not doing a volk-js
[02:04:22] <matt_mills[m]> :D
[02:04:49] <DerekKozel[m]> volk-generic probably compiles fine into webassembly
[02:06:49] <matt_mills[m]> Derek Kozel: Is there any "official" fundraising details about the installer stuff anywhere?
[02:07:32] <DerekKozel[m]> Nope. Hopefully something published by the end of the year, or by FOSDEM
[02:08:01] <DerekKozel[m]> Probably the work descriptions will be on the wiki before then
[02:08:15] <DerekKozel[m]> budgeting and the grant process are slower
[02:09:23] <matt_mills[m]> What about something "official" that connects the fundraising link to the GR org?
[02:10:25] <DerekKozel[m]> That should happen sooner. We need someone to author a donations page for the website and submit a PR
[02:10:39] <DerekKozel[m]> there's a few folks who have said they'll work on that when they get time
[02:11:12] <matt_mills[m]> ok, I was just going to try to promote it a bit, but I don't think anyone will let me w/o something connecting it to you guys
[02:11:37] <DerekKozel[m]> Totally fair. Just a question of energy/time
[02:11:57] <DerekKozel[m]> I should get off chat, into bed, and see if I can do at least a basic page this week
[02:12:01] <matt_mills[m]> Yeah, no problem at all
[02:12:06] <matt_mills[m]> cya

[14:38:04] <ascialdo[m]>  * Hello, I am currently using GR3.8 connected to hardware (PlutoSDR). I am trying to print some messages that i am sending through another SDR, so i have my demodulated signal going to a Message Debug block. I am able to print them correctly, but sometimes it crashes, giving this error. Any idea on how to solve this issue on this version?
[14:38:28] <Yamakaja[m]> Looks like you encountered a bit error ^^
[14:40:01] <ascialdo[m]> Yes 😆
[14:40:25] <Yamakaja[m]> I'm not sure how that's related to the GR version?
[14:40:52] <Yamakaja[m]> Did you include any redundancy in the design of your communications system? Or a CRC to make sure you only print correct values?

[14:41:19] <ascialdo[m]> i was wondering if there was the possibility to keep the flowgraph run, instead of crashing completely
[14:42:37] <Yamakaja[m]> I think you're approaching this from the wrong angle, the flowgraph crashing is the symptom of the underlying issue: Your communications channel isn't reliable enough. The common approaches to addressing that are channels codes / FEC

[14:46:04] <ascialdo[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I understood, yes i didn't implement any FEC for the moment, i just did a setup where i printed a message that i was receiving! Thanks for the tip
[14:46:12] <anwesh[m]> Hi everyone, I'm new to this community. I want to perform packet communication in GNURADIO but packet encoder and packet decoder blocks have been deprecated so can anyone help me out in designing the packet communication... thanks 
[14:47:00] <Yamakaja[m]> ascialdo[m]: And if you really just want to prevent the flowgraph from crashing, you can wrap the print in a try / except block ;)

[16:19:44] <linge93[m]> Hi,Why is there packet loss when using usrp+ofdm.grc to transmit data? The strange thing is that when the number of my data packets is too much, it will be lost when it exceeds a certain number, but will not be lost within a certain range. I adjust the amplitude of the symbol input to "UHD:USRP Sink" to a certain extent. Reduce this loss, why is this? 
[16:33:32] <JoshMorman[m]> <monowar> "gr_modtoo bind what took me some..." <- Just be careful gr_modtool bind doesn't work with templated blocks.  The bindings there will have to be done manually.  See for example in-tree blocks::divide_blk

[16:45:39] <monowar> JoshMorman[m], thank you very much for the tip. I will try to learn from the divide_blk
[16:49:02] <monowar> there is one more thing that is bothering me, 
[16:49:02] <monowar> why some of the initialization is done by size of variable rather than variable type?
[16:49:02] <monowar> for example, in copy_impl.cc, it is copy::make(size_t itemsize)
[16:49:02] <monowar> i was expecting it to be something like copy<int>::make()
[16:49:02] <monowar> is there a certain benefit/reason for using itemsize?
[16:50:52] <Yamakaja[m]> Yes, because that way you can easily work with custom data structures, vectors of items and more. So for example if you wanted to work with vectors of ints instead of ints you can just write something like `vector_size * sizeof(int)`
[16:51:32] <Yamakaja[m]> Internally the scheduler is just moving bytes, and doesn't really care about their interpretation much

[16:54:38] <monowar> That makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much for taking the time to explain it to me.

[19:40:20] <amlangford[m]> SNR Estimator Probe: Could someone please clarify where I should be placing the in-tree "SNR Estimator" in my QPSK demod chain? The documentation says "The estimator is normally placed before clock recovery." In my flowgraph, this is right at the input to the RX chain, and the SNR numbers Im getting out just dont seem right. I have a perfect channel, with no additive noise, yet the SNR est. is reporting 6dB SNR
[19:49:06] <amlangford[m]> Ive experimented by moving the estimator further down the chain, which increases the reported SNR values significantly... Im not sure which measurement point is correct. Also, the values dont seem to scale as Id expect when I increase the additive noise power. 
[19:49:27] <funkylab[m]> acording to your screenshot, you have a noise standard deviation of 0.1, that's not "no additive noise"
[19:50:42] <funkylab[m]> plus, honestly, this is GNU Radio 3.7, and you should not be using that, we've fixed a lot of things in channel models, demodulators, estimators since then, and nobody actually still works on it

[20:09:02] <funkylab[m]> the place seems fine. 
[20:09:28] <funkylab[m]> note that you're not currently doing that, but if you use a multipath channel as your channel model, the estimation will probably work even less.

[21:57:21] <blue94[m]> If its not set to yes it will only stream the information once

[22:02:10] <Guest36> but even if repeat option is set to no, i.e set to run only once, shouldn't there be colour change to the raster plot? why does it give always display in the yellow color '0(zero)' scale range.
