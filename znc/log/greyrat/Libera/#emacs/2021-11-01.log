[00:13:25] <pmetzger> the clang language server uses the underlying clang parser.

[00:19:25] <pmetzger> right but I can't feed this into clang on my machine.
[00:19:33] <pmetzger> and you're not giving us clang's error message either.
[00:19:44] <pmetzger> cut this down to the smallest possible reproducing case you can.
[00:20:16] <Common-Lisp> clang gives "expected expression" on the first line of code after the label (`tcp`...), then undeclared identifier errors where server_address is later referenced 
[00:20:28] <pmetzger> btw, you have no need to use a goto in this code. Also the code is buggy.
[00:20:58] <Common-Lisp> I could rewrite it into a while, but I have 2 non-looping cases and 1 looping cases, so in this case it's cleaner with the goto

[00:30:20] <pmetzger> sorry, got disconnected right after my last message. Power isn't entirely reliable where I live.
[00:30:50] <pmetzger> anyway, tip: in sockets, you do not want to do the incrementing a port thing. the sockets library can handle finding an open port for you. RTFM.
[00:31:03] <pmetzger> You don't write code to search for an open port on your own, the kernel does that.
[00:31:11] <Common-Lisp> both my system's version of clang and gcc default to C17 
[00:31:29] <pmetzger> So?
[00:31:38] <pmetzger> What is the error message from clang.
[00:31:40] <Common-Lisp> pmetzger: I saw something about setting the port to 0 to get an ephemeral port but I wasn't sure how do actually print that out to connect to it 
[00:31:47] <Common-Lisp> pmetzger: re: "so?" - I was asked.
[00:31:51] <pmetzger> you don't have to "print it out".
[00:32:05] <pmetzger> Just set the port to 0.
[00:32:33] <Common-Lisp> pmetzger: without printing it out or setting it manually, how would I go about connecting to it?
[00:32:47] <bpalmer> Common-Lisp: hmm. OK, not sure why the s = { .sin_family = ... } isn't working with clang, then.
[00:32:55] <pmetzger> I don't understand what you're trying to do.
[00:33:22] <pmetzger> But if you want to know what port you got when you opened something and told the kernel to pick for you, you can ask it.
[00:33:25] <bpalmer> (a few other minor notes: the socket family is usually AF_INET or another AF_ constant; I don't know what SOCKET_TYPE means there)
[00:33:37] <pmetzger> I recommend reading Stevens. It's a very good introduction.
[00:33:56] <pmetzger> And if you wanted to do this loop, you could use a normal C loop without any loss.

[01:32:24] <wgreenhouse> if you're on an android device using UserLand, any android app with a textbox
[01:32:39] <wgreenhouse> should be able to paste what you just C-k'ed
[01:32:47] <jirido> well Android does not. And my userland system dont have gui
[01:33:14] <wgreenhouse> jirido: ok, then that confirms UserLand's terminal emulator doesn't support the sequence
[01:33:47] <wgreenhouse> termux does
[01:34:17] <wgreenhouse> for most accurate testing use emacs by itself, not inside screen or something like that
[01:34:20] <jirido> So it does not need to be an capable android app I try to paste in?
[01:34:56] <wgreenhouse> nope. on the gui end it doesn't have to know where the paste came from
[01:35:33] <wgreenhouse> osc 52 is just an app running in terminal telling the terminal "hey, if there's a clipboard, put the following stuff in it"

[01:56:39] <wgreenhouse> which often tends to eat them otherwise, even if not configured to do anything useful with them
[01:56:41] <jlf> yes, and "<jirido> Yes It does work between emacs and android. But not in a screen session."
[01:56:46] <jirido> screen should have native suport for this and not need to be "feed" it trough any script if this capability is turned on, as should termux. That is why I get confused
[01:57:07] <jlf> anyway hope that helps - good luck.

[04:04:16] <bpalmer> ,install
[04:04:17] <fsbot`> install is [0/5] To install a <file>.el, save it to e.g. ~/elisp

[04:04:17] <fsbot`> [2] now FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FILE, typically adding (require '<file>) to the end of ~/.emacs

[04:32:11] <bpalmer> it is normal. emacs runs fine with no user init files; if you haven't changed anything, there's no need for the files to exist.
[04:32:30] <grym> jirido: that seems normal to me; you can just then add an init.el inside .emacs.d/ and put in it what you need (if you need to put anything) 
[04:32:32] <bpalmer> your user init file will be creatd if you use M-x customize RET and save any changes (by default , custom-file is the same as the init file)

[07:47:54] <rnkn> on a long enough timeline you will end up using both vi/emacs keys
[07:49:05] <jirido> It is exhausting to remeber all new stuff. 
[07:49:15] <rnkn> e.g. most terminals and many apps implenet readline keys for navigation, but then lots of great termial apps use vi-like navigation, and you will always end up editing something in vi

[08:16:03] <jcbjoe2021> It’s it wrong to use the arrow keys in emacs?
[08:16:54] <skangas> jcbjoe2021: Nope.
[08:17:20] <skangas> jcbjoe2021: Though many users prefer C-n C-p C-b C-f as you don't have to move your hand off of the home row.
[08:17:34] <skangas> It's more of a productivity hack than a strict requirement, however.
[08:18:24] <skangas> Also note that in the minibuffer, it is useful to try the up/down keys to see what you get, which is usually the history of inserted stuff and/or some default value.
[08:18:42] <rnkn> even if it were "wrong" who would judge such a thing, or how?
[08:19:32] <jcbjoe2021> rnkn: it would seem if you don’t use the keys that are built in you might not be as fast as people who use arrow keys or something
[08:20:11] <rnkn> I have never been invited to an emacs race
[08:20:13] <skangas> jcbjoe2021: Yeah, but I wouldn't worry too much about it when starting out.  I do recommend learning it eventually, as it really is faster for most people.

[09:05:56] <twb> bpalmer: one thing that I liked about reST is they actually have a document discussing all the syntax they *didn't* adopt, and why they decided it was worse

[09:46:24] <twb> edrx: no.
[09:46:46] <twb> edrx: OTF and TTF are outline fonts.  So e.g. "O" glyph is two unrelated circle paths
[09:47:05] <twb> edrx: a stroked font has a single path for "O" and rules about how to vary the thickness aronud the virtual pen
[09:47:36] <twb> edrx: this means if you make "O" change from say 10pt to 36pt, you don't have to manually handle the inner and outer curves changing differently

[13:06:21] <fsbot`> Hej pingpongball!
[13:06:38] <pingpongball> Thanks . :)  
[13:06:58] <pingpongball> do you guys use emacs client/server or just use emacs
[13:07:42] <bremner> I use mainly emacsclient
[13:08:05] <pingpongball> yes i've a question. Are you on gnome or ?
[13:08:05] <bremner> "emacsclient -a '' -c" to be precise
[13:08:17] <bremner> I'm on ?
[13:08:59] <pingpongball> i had setup a daemon which just start as soon i boot. 
[13:09:10] <pingpongball> and was going to setup an emacsclient.
[13:09:11] <pingpongball> For this
[13:09:57] <pingpongball> i used "emacsclient --create-frame" and put it on my ".desktop" to view on icons. 
[13:10:51] <bremner> does it work from the command line?

[13:11:05] <pingpongball> yes it works on command line
[13:11:29] <pingpongball> for gaining performance, i thought , but became opposite. like when i open or hit emacsclient on desktop,   it opens up but just shuts up if i dont touch it, strangely
[13:12:36] <pingpongball> also more of it, It tooks about 2 seconds to load that client. while it took only 0.6 second on normal emacs.

[13:19:40] <Unhammer> cf. https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/trojan-source-bug-threatens-the-security-of-all-code/ is there a supported way of turning off bidi-display-reordering? according to https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2019-07/msg00294.html and https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=44329#24 doing (setq bidi-display-reordering nil) is only for debugs (I've had crashes due to that myself), but how then
[13:19:42] <Unhammer> can I avoid reordering due
[13:19:44] <Unhammer> to control chars?
[13:20:29] <Unhammer> (If you haven't seen it happen, try opening https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickboucher/trojan-source/main/JavaScript/stretched-string.js in emacs and (setq-local bidi-display-reordering (not bidi-display-reordering)) )
[13:21:26] <Unhammer> The problem is, as soon as you hit some arabic or something and your emacs is compiled with harfbuzz, turning it off will crash emacs
[13:22:44] <Unhammer> (and no, (setq bidi-inhibit-bpa t bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right) doesn't help against control chars)

[14:07:08] <bkhl> I use the emacsclient -a thing (with an alias) too to get the daemon started. Did a performance cleanup of my emacs config recently and got the startup time from ~15 seconds to just under ~1 second on my laptop, mostly by changing gc-cons-threshold and file-name-handler-alist during initialization, and fixing up some things that could be deferred
[14:07:08] <bkhl> but weren't.
[14:07:48] <bkhl> So basically it means starting the first second takes a second, later on it's instant, which I think is quite acceptable.

[15:09:45] <fredmorcos> emacs leaves a file named something like this #%2Ascratch%2A#wNVaON# in my home directory if I type stuff in the *scratch* buffer then exit emacs... what variable controls the place and name of these files?
[15:10:11] <fredmorcos> I already have auto-save-file-name-transforms set to ((".*" "/tmp/emacs/autosaves/\\1" t))
[15:11:13] <fredmorcos> file-visiting buffers have their autosaves saved there in /tmp...
[15:11:30] <jbe> yeah, that setting is probably why that's happening to you
[15:11:39] <fredmorcos> but not for the non-file-visiting scratch buffer
[15:11:53] <jbe> *scratch* doesn't have a filename since it's just a buffer
[15:12:33] <jbe> see https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/7729/autosave-scratch-to-a-directory
[15:13:08] <fredmorcos> oooh so the original value of (("\\`/[^/]*:\\([^/]*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)\\'" "/tmp/\\2" t)) filtered out buffers named like this *...*?

[20:57:54] <technomancy> (but neither is "lisp" so ...)
[20:58:34] <aphysically> wasamasa: thblt: there's a unicode standard specifically for confusable detection; so ideally the editor just highlights the characters that aren't the confusable-normalized variants in identifiers http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Confusable_Detection
[20:58:42] <Catie> And the Maclisp manual says a subr is compiled, and that uncompiled code is an 'expr'. An expr can become a subr if you run it through the compiler
[20:58:52] <aphysically> this is language-agnostic and noninvasive
[21:00:29] <Shortstop77> for Emacs-Slack, how do I make use-package obtain the :token from a specific file?

[23:33:40] <bkhl> Bayes, I've tried fonts with ligatures in Emacs before, but switched to a two-width font combined with global-prettify-symbols-mode instead, which I find works better out of the box.
[23:34:09] * edgar-rft also wants a heating for his bed
[23:34:16] <Bayes> bkhl does emacs not like fira code for some reason?
[23:34:33] <bkhl> Bayes, that probably works fine and you can use ligature.el with it.
[23:34:40] <bkhl> But then you are still limited to ligatures in the font.

[23:38:48] <johnjay> bkhl: what is the definition of a 2-width font?
[23:38:57] <johnjay> every character takes 2 space
[23:39:10] <bkhl> johnjay, no, some take one width, some others take double that width.
[23:39:41] <bkhl> Well, it's usually double, theoretically could be some other width I think.
[23:40:19] <johnjay> hrm. i'm trying to deduce how that would work with prettify
[23:40:25] <johnjay> what happens if you use prettify without it
[23:40:36] *** Quits: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:40:49] <bkhl> johnjay, then with e.g. Perl you'd still get arrows and so on from your font, but they look pretty squashed.
[23:41:18] <bkhl> If arrows are double width, they take up the same space as the two-character operator (=>) in e.g. Perl
[23:41:34] <artefact> so it's a proportional font that tries to be monospace-ish?
[23:41:44] <johnjay> but perl wants => no matter what right
[23:42:09] <johnjay> i thought we were talking about covering up the symbol with unicode
[23:42:10] <bkhl> Yeah, but with prettify it just changes the displayed character, it doesn't change the buffer content.
[23:42:20] <bkhl> Yeah, that's what the prettify thing does.
[23:42:41] <bkhl> But if you do that with pure monospace, then e.g. => be a single space wide, so will make your code not line up.
[23:42:41] <johnjay> meaning it replaces => with the appropriate 2-width char
[23:42:45] <bkhl> Yeah.
[23:42:47] <johnjay> in this case an arrow of length 2 spaces
[23:42:48] <artefact> OTF fonts can have builtin ligatures
[23:42:48] <johnjay> oh ok
[23:43:04] <bkhl> artefact, yeah, but then you can't have your editor do replacements other than the ones your font have ligatures for.
[23:43:27] <artefact> that's where you see if a font was made by a true nerd or not

[23:43:54] <johnjay> i'm not sure what you mean there but it sounds like a tangle
[23:44:04] <bkhl> Less of a tangle than having ligatures in the font.
[23:44:23] <bkhl> Then you need to have both the editor support it, and the font to contain the particular combinations you want.
[23:44:56] <artefact> the editor doesn't have to care that much, aiui the underlying libs do all the work
[23:45:21] <bkhl> artefact, yeah, but then you get a lot of false positives in languages where two characters that have a ligature is not actually a single operator.
[23:45:36] <bkhl> In ligature.el you can actually enable individual ligatures per-language.
[23:45:47] *** Joins: shicz (~shicz@123.103.9.7)
[23:46:08] <bkhl> Though then I feel like you can just as well just use prettify and a font that has the larger-size characters instead.
[23:46:20] <artefact> good point
[23:46:46] <bkhl> Plus with the ligatures, you can never make characters combine unless there is a ligature for it in the font.
[23:47:15] <johnjay> bkhl: what languages have you tried it in
[23:47:18] <artefact> <-- still uses bitmap fonts, ligatures are not something i worry about, ever

[23:50:00] <bkhl> I've never been able to get into C/C++, so Rust is really the first time I've been able to do much in a "systems" programming language.
[23:50:09] <johnjay> what i mean is. rust may have technical merit
[23:50:19] <johnjay> but it seems like it's more the community around rust that has value than the language itself
[23:50:22] <johnjay> if that makes sense
[23:50:36] <bkhl> That is probably part of why I've been able to get into it.
[23:50:48] <johnjay> so it's kind of circular
[23:50:55] <johnjay> language gets popular. so more people use it. so it gets more popular
[23:51:00] <johnjay> and soon paris hilton is a celebrity
[23:51:01] <edgar-rft> rust is the new facebook?
[23:51:14] <bkhl> If you want to learn C or something understanding what you should do wrt tooling and build systems and so is quite involved.
[23:51:31] <bkhl> I remember the first time I tried to learn programming.
[23:51:46] <bkhl> I had an MSX when I was around 9 and borrowed a book about C programming from a library.
[23:51:53] <artefact> i like c because it's the gold standard. there's huge (maybe too much, *cough* autotools) amounts of tooling. it's also easy to do things incorrectly and shoot yourself (and others) in fun various ways
[23:51:54] <johnjay> yes. also i've found C is sufficiently complex and wrinkled that you get a lot of bogus opinions and weird viewpoints
[23:52:01] <bkhl> Then I gave up for 7 years or so.
[23:52:37] <johnjay> like i asked someone the other day if there's any kind over overflow warning if you negate the most negative integer in C
[23:52:52] <johnjay> it was hard to even get them to acknowledge the question mattered

[23:58:41] <masterbuilder> johnjay: It's not that I totally agree, C has proportionally way too many footguns and it is a little bit too old-fashioned for its own good, but that's what you get when you try to standardize a fundamentally broken language and then try to update it for many decades without breaking it even further
[23:58:54] <masterbuilder> I think C is mostly fine though, it just requires you to be responsible
[23:59:08] <masterbuilder> not that I totally disagree*
[23:59:32] <Catie> masterbuilder: agreed on that front. It's just that C's version of "responsibility" is super tedious
