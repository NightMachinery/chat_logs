[00:00:00] <companion_cube> I said dynamic, not weak
[00:00:07] <rb> oh my bad then
[00:00:15] <rb> gnome is dynamic, yes
[00:00:18] <feoh> iDrougge: You're way oversimplifying. Or you're trying to be funny and as usual I'm not parsing your humor :)
[00:00:19] <companion_cube> (even though I find the distinction super useless but well)
[00:00:26] <rb> vala _is_ mostly static though
[00:00:33] <rb> since it looks at actual GObject type definitions
[00:00:53] <rb> when you need to interact with other C code then it just becomes regular C type syste,
[00:00:55] <rb> m
[00:00:56] <pe> If you pass the wrong type to something, it will probably log a message and do an early return.
[00:01:05] <feoh> My problem with Vala is that I found myself almost immediately needing to code outside the box which required me to understand all the C Gtk underpinnings anyway
[00:01:11] <rb> pe: *** Glib-CRITICAL ***
[00:01:16] <iDrougge> feoh: I’m trying to see things from an open source advocacy perspective.
[00:01:25] <companion_cube> glib seems like a handmade nightmare copy of C++98
[00:01:36] <companion_cube> :D too real rb
[00:01:39] <rb> it's not a nightmare, but why use it when C with classes exists?
[00:02:12] <feoh> iDrougge: I mean, what you say is true, except that what you really need is a group of blind *Gnome* developers, because the amount of onboarding it would take for your average off the street coder to be able to wade in and make changes is non trivial.
[00:02:28] <rb> (aside aside: C++ isn't OOP, it's a terrible reification of OOP limited by the arbitrary definition of class it has)
[00:02:51] <companion_cube> OOP isn't a well defined concept anyway
[00:02:56] <feoh> Like, you would need to be incredibly committed and have a vast amount of free time to be able to meaningfully contribute to Gnome's squirming C innards as near as I can tell.
[00:03:01] <companion_cube> but if you want vtables and the likes, C++ seems less painful
[00:03:44] <feoh> iDrougge: Like, I am all for open source advocacy, but IMO that advocacy has to come from a place of pragmatism or else it risks doing more ham than good to the community.
[00:04:30] <iDrougge> Some days I have a feeling that open source is the early 2000s equivalent to the blockchain.
[00:04:38] <feoh> heh
[00:05:14] <companion_cube> except it was always, err, useful?
[00:05:37] <feoh> This verges into a rant of mine on how the Linux community could be 1000% better if it wholly embraced radical candor.
[00:05:55] <pe> feoh: as for GNOME project's size and C -- I am also wondering there, but my reason is all the Java-esque boilerplate. Note that GNOME also essentially still uses C89, with a few select extensions.
[00:06:21] <feoh> Linux is NOT for everyone. It cannot cater to everyone's particular needs. But if it caters to YOUR needs, or IF you have the time and the skill to meaningfully contribute and scratch your own itch, then LInux can be positively awesome
[00:06:25] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Well, it obviously is if you are someone whom it fits, just as bitcoin is a good thing if you’re a criminal or the kind of person for whom open source is a good fit with CPU cycles to spare.
[00:06:29] <feoh> (IMO ^^)
[00:07:04] <feoh> pe: Do you think later versions of the C standard would help a lot?
[00:07:26] <feoh> I'll admit I'm kinda ignorant of anything in C last late 90s/early naughties ANSI :)

[00:11:54] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Naturally, I’m just saying that X is useful for those who consider it useful. That doesn’t mean it is useful for mankind as such.
[00:12:01] <pe> companion_cube: Jesus, I'd pick GObject over C++98 any day. If only for signals.
[00:12:27] <iDrougge> So why was C++ continued if it was so bad?
[00:12:29] <companion_cube> ah but, no one wants C++98
[00:12:36] <companion_cube> why would one want to keep using that

[00:13:36] <iDrougge> I don’t know if the Linux part makes Android any better.
[00:16:21] <feoh> companion_cube: To be clear I love and use plenty of FLOSS. IMO FLOSS desktop environments and any super UI heavy products tend to be problematic for people with sincere accessibility needs because, to be fair, they require a TON of straight up engineer hours which in our current capitalist reality equates to big $$$ :(
[00:16:38] <pe> feoh: meaningful contributions to GNOME -- yes, though the language isn't the largest factor.
[00:16:46] <feoh> 'struth.
[00:16:58] <companion_cube> sure, not saying FLOSS solves everything or makes the best end user applications
[00:17:07] <companion_cube> but it's useful nonetheless
[00:17:12] <feoh> Totally
[00:17:35] <feoh> And it's awesome in a thousand different ways. Huge fan. I just want its proponents to consider embracing a more pragmatic attitude towards where it can help and where it may be less of a good fit.
[00:18:20] <feoh> Like, maybe we don't need to string people up if they choose to run a commercial desktop because it meets their fringe special needs better :)
[00:18:40] <companion_cube> ah, for sure.
[00:19:04] <feoh> These days I mostly enjoy all that crunchy Linux goodness through WSL, because I also get to enjoy all that accessibility goodness that MSFT has spent untold treasure creating and maintaining :)
[00:19:51] <pe> feoh: C99 removes the requirement on declaring variables at the top of a function/block, which is one source of annoying verbosity. Maybe more of a pet peeve.
[00:20:02] <companion_cube> also, booleans
[00:20:05] <companion_cube> 🤯🤯🤯🤯
[00:20:18] <pe> gboolean, there is nothing special about stdbool.h.
[00:21:05] <companion_cube> I mean in things C99 added
[00:21:09] <feoh> pe: I'd have trouble not declaring at the top. I cut my teeth on K&R :)
[00:21:34] <iDrougge> Adding booleans 20 years after the fact doesn’t help much.
[00:21:55] <companion_cube> it helps for new projects
[00:22:20] <pe> Well, sure.
[00:22:23] <iDrougge> Everything is still a boolean in C, now you just have two ways of expressing it.
[00:22:29] <iDrougge> A bit like in Javascript.
[00:22:52] <iDrougge> Or adding null-safety to Java, twenty years after the fact.

[00:23:08] <iDrougge> Now you can have a nullable nullable non-null.
[00:23:10] <feoh> Could it be that the elephant in the room here WRT truly huge and complex C projects like Gnome is that the language itself doesn't really have good tools for things like enforcing contracts around complex data structures, so when you debug you end up lost in a vast sea of pointers and malloc()'d blobs of memory and it's 🤯 inducing? :)

[00:33:10] <companion_cube> and a lot of downsides

[00:38:14] <ngoldbaum> he got the witness out the door
[00:38:23] <steenuil> it does have bounds checking, but you can cast an array to a pointer
[00:38:30] <pe> ngoldbaum: yeah, tough competition.
[00:38:38] <companion_cube> so it has pointer arithmetic? hilarious
[00:38:52] <companion_cube> (well. _easy_ pointer arithmetic, I should say)

[00:39:01] <ngoldbaum> no dicts though
[00:39:06] <companion_cube> no generics

[00:39:12] <steenuil> I think I reviewed my opinion of pointer arithmetic after trying out Forth
[00:40:26] <feoh> I like FORTH but have never had to write a substantial program in it
[00:40:42] <feoh> I kinda wish FACTOR had taken off more.

[00:41:38] <steenuil> I like that he calls them "tagged unions" but there's no tag

[19:27:20] <kline> oh, i guess i dont, i have to use meson - and its not well documented for meson because its a built-in rather than any kind of rule i can just grep for when i know where the wrong directory is
[19:28:46] <kline> so what should have been `./configure --prefix=/usr; make; sudo make install` became a 30 min reading of new tools docs and googling for other docs in other projects where it was more explicitly spelled out for people who didnt already author meson/ninja stuff as a developer

[20:20:21] <gwozniak> So, yeah
[20:20:42] <riv> XPath is nice!
[20:21:08] <gwozniak> It is, but it's a bit confusing at times
[20:21:19] <gwozniak> Much like regexps
[20:23:02] <riv> yeah it's like a regex for pointing at nodes, really cool little DSL

[20:25:35] <pe> XSLT reminds me of an ad-hoc PDF renderer with pseudo-XML template input I made at work.
[20:26:23] <pe> It's a programming language in XML that contains another programming language...
[20:26:44] <constxo> in programming languages where lvalues in assignment expressions may have side effects, are those usually evaluated before or after the right hand side of the assignment?
[20:27:19] <pe> It's famously undefined in C/C++.
[20:27:32] <pe> IIRC
[20:27:38] <constxo> let a = 1; xs[a] = a++; should that be xs[1] = 1; or xs[2] = 1;

[20:28:17] <pe> This is a simple case.
[20:28:33] <pe> I was thinking of xs[a++] = a++;
[20:29:01] <constxo> right now i am evaluating the LHS first but i can't remember why... evaluating the RHS seems like the more straightforward way to do it
[20:29:03] *** kthxbye is now known as dminkovsky
[20:29:24] <riv> I think that it is undefined
[20:29:51] <constxo> leaving it undefined seems undesirable but as long as it's defined, is there any practical reason you'd want it one way over the other?
[20:30:35] <riv> "The side effect of updating the stored value of the left operand is sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands."
[20:31:31] <constxo> right but what about the relative ordering of the evaluation of the left and right operands themselves
[20:31:43] <riv> so... this is a strange statement. It seems to be saying that xs[a] and a++ are computed in some unspecified order, then the location calculated for the LHS is set to the RHS value
[20:32:22] <riv> so basically this code is unspecified and needs to be rewritten
[20:33:03] <gwozniak> If you define such things, then you have to be precise about evaluation order in complicated expressions, which can limit optimization opportunities.  This is mainly why it's undefined in C
[20:33:50] <gwozniak> And, in general, it's why side-effecting "expressions" are a bad idea
[20:34:28] <pe> Go removed it.
[20:34:45] <constxo> seems like V8 evaluates the LHS first
[20:35:01] <constxo> a = 0; xs[++a] = ++a; is like xs[1] = 2

[20:36:22] <gwozniak> I would resist any such code, personally
[20:36:38] <riv> you can see what a specific compiler on specific settings produces in terms of ASM
[20:36:43] <riv> with godbolt or whatever
[20:36:49] <riv> but its not reliable
[20:36:49] <constxo> i tried to design my compiler/runtime so that targetting an assignment location is separate from the actual assignment operation itself
[20:37:10] <gwozniak> riv: I've worked with XPath before.  It's just that I always forget the syntax because it's kind of weird
[20:37:11] <riv> if you are designing a language, I think the best thing you can do here is error
[20:37:24] <riv> gwozniak: yes I think that is why css selectors are winning
[20:37:35] <constxo> the problem is, when you write something like a = f();, the address of a is pushed onto a target stack, then f() is evaluated, then the address is popped from the target stack and the result of f() is written there
[20:37:35] <riv> I kind of see them as an evolution of xpath, even if that's not true
[20:37:40] <gwozniak> Except CSS selectors don't work on XML
[20:37:46] <riv> D:
[20:37:52] <riv> there's always a catch
[20:38:03] <riv> I can't believe we ended up with HTML and XML being two separate things
[20:38:06] <riv> whose idea was this!
[20:38:06] <constxo> but during the evaluation of f(), the address of a may have changed because the stack was realloc()ed
[20:38:24] <constxo> could resolve that issue by just evaluating f() first
[20:38:58] <pe> constxo: or you launch f(), keep the result in a register, and assign it to a, reverse order.
[20:39:08] <pe> And I have no idea what you're working on.
[20:39:21] <gwozniak> This assumes you have a register, of course
[20:39:28] <constxo> just a toy programming language
[20:40:22] <riv> your language is a lot like C?
[20:40:48] <companion_cube> just sayin, in rust you have `a += 1`, and it returns ()
