[02:54:08] <Hunterkll> yuken: that's a conversion build though

[02:54:15] <Hunterkll> with a very specific name
[02:54:16] <yuken> @Hotmess AR-15s aren't select fire normally.
[02:54:21] <yuken> Unless you drill a hole and use a different FCG.
[02:54:22] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess right, and AR-15s aren't select fire
[02:54:25] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> the civ ones arnt
[02:54:33] <Hunterkll> there's no non-civilian AR-15 
[02:54:37] <Hunterkll> just modified variants produced 
[02:54:39] <yuken> Actually, my AR-15 can't take a full auto FCG at all.
[02:54:42] <Hunterkll> the AR-15 itself is not select fire 
[02:54:50] <Hunterkll> and wasn't designed as such
[02:54:54] <yuken> You couldn't convert it to full auto without additional milling of the shelf.
[02:55:06] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess hilariously, over here, a STEN is like $5k cheaper than an assault rifle
[02:55:19] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> why buy a STEN hoenstly
[02:55:21] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> just make one

[02:55:36] <Hunterkll> .... so you don't go to jail for 20 years?
[02:55:37] <yuken> Illegal to make a full-auto gun, basically.
[02:55:53] <Hunterkll> yea, there's a Sten Mk II  with integrated barrel suppresson for $10k up right now
[02:55:55] <yuken> Without an SOT, and permission slips, and other shit.
[02:56:01] <Hunterkll> a semi-auto sten is dirt cheap however 
[02:56:19] <Hunterkll> of course if you're cheap you just get a MAC-10 for like $8-9k 
[02:56:20] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> honestly a STEN is one of the last guns id ever own
[02:56:28] <Hunterkll> but if i'm doing th at i'd rather spend an extra $1k for something interesting
[02:56:32] <yuken> @Hotmess full-auto was practically banned in 1986 for civilians in the US, unless you buy such guns made before and registered before 1986.

[03:21:36] <Hunterkll> but the real issue comes with say, polymer coating scraping off, etc, caccumulating
[03:21:37] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> but i guess brass is cheaper
[03:21:51] <Hunterkll> in addition to fouling from powder etc

[04:00:21] <Telgareith> M.2 is 4x PCIe right?
[04:00:26] <Hunterkll> it can be
[04:00:28] <Hunterkll> it can also be SATA
[04:00:33] <Hunterkll> or x2 PCIe
[04:00:35] <Hunterkll> or even x1
[04:00:40] <Hunterkll> depends on how it's wired up/keyed
[04:01:17] <Hunterkll> it can even be wired up for both 
[04:01:33] <Hunterkll> most common these days is pcie only 
[04:02:29] <Hunterkll> it's essentially a mini PCIe slot (same connector/formfactor) that was adapted to also provide SATA (or provide SATA only)  
[04:03:01] <Hunterkll> which is why you can take like, older mini PCIe wifi cards and use them in M.2 slots sometimes :D
[04:03:47] <Telgareith> anybody know what I can put in a M.2 22x30mm port?
[04:04:00] <Hunterkll> .... whatever it's wired up for?
[04:04:07] <Hunterkll> most likely a 2230 NVMe SSD?
[04:04:20] <Hunterkll> depending on how/where it's wired up in the system you could also turn it into another PCIe slot lol
[04:04:22] <Telgareith> M.2 is literally a compact PCIe port
[04:04:35] <Hunterkll> .... and some M.2 slots are SATA-only
[04:04:38] <Hunterkll> without any PCIe at all
[04:04:40] <Disconsented> or USB
[04:04:42] <Telgareith> ok
[04:04:46] <Telgareith> NOT the sata kind
[04:04:46] <Hunterkll> some are both
[04:04:55] <Hunterkll> some are also wired to the PCH and can really only be leveraged for storage
[04:05:00] <Telgareith> M key or whatever
[04:05:00] <Hunterkll> some are wired to the main system PCIe and can do anything 
[04:05:09] <xe0n> lolll check the specs of the machine you have, it'll tell you what it supports...
[04:05:16] <Telgareith> i'm looking
[04:05:18] <Telgareith> it doesn't say
[04:05:28] <Hunterkll> just assume 2230 NVMe SSD and call it a day
[04:06:35] <Telgareith> I want to add thunderbolt :|
[04:06:51] <Telgareith> I doubt it's possible though
[04:07:06] <Telgareith> I think TB is a PCH/CPU feature only
[04:07:08] <Hunterkll> that sometimes requires firmware support depending on board, but still
[04:07:18] <Hunterkll> nope
[04:07:25] <Hunterkll> my system's thunderbolt is a PCIe addin card
[04:07:43] <Telgareith> egh
[04:07:44] <Telgareith> know what
[04:07:46] <Telgareith> don't care
[04:07:46] <Hunterkll> you could try something like this
[04:07:47] <Hunterkll> https://www.amazon.com/M-2-Golden-Finger-OCulink-Adapter/dp/B07KX87V61
[04:07:49] <Telgareith> just realized
[04:08:50] <Telgareith> this will mostly remote into my desktop
[04:09:04] <Telgareith> I need to figure out how to get that RDP apps feature working
[04:09:14] <Telgareith> idr what its called though
[04:09:21] <xe0n> remoteapp...
[04:10:45] <Hunterkll> so you get oculink off of the m.2 slot, then get an oculink riser like this -> https://comino.com/en/risers/
[04:10:50] <Hunterkll> then put in a thunderbolt PCIe card
[04:10:54] <Hunterkll> and that might get you working
[04:11:24] <Disconsented> TB is janky as hell with quasi DRM
[04:11:51] <Telgareith> no the goal was to get an externally attached PCIe slot
[04:12:09] <Hunterkll> well then get M.2 -> Oculink -> PCIe riser
[04:12:10] <Telgareith> so I can stop at the "riser" step
[04:12:19] <Hunterkll> you'll have to figure out the steps
[04:12:23] <Hunterkll> but either way, it may or may not work
[04:12:24] <Hunterkll> so who knows
[04:12:27] <Telgareith> yea
[04:12:29] <Telgareith> I know
[04:12:31] <Telgareith> its jank
[04:12:34] <Telgareith> thanks Hunterkll 
[04:12:41] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: you can also get something just like this
[04:12:41] <Hunterkll> https://www.amazon.com/EXPLOMOS-NGFF-Adapter-Power-Cable/dp/B074Z5YKXJ
[04:12:47] <Hunterkll> and then use a pcie riser/extension to bring it outside
[04:13:00] <Telgareith> has to be 2230
[04:13:12] <Telgareith> I need the 2280 for a NVMe drive
[04:13:26] <Hunterkll> yer probably SOL 
[04:13:40] <Hunterkll> that 2230 was probably marked "Mini PCIe" on a previous revision too, lol

[10:04:05] <Hunterkll> UBNT's certianly grown up in that sector a fair bit, but i'd still go Ruckus if i were on a budget doing a large/dense deployment 
[10:04:25] <Hunterkll> but yea folk like UBNT are eating cisco's SMB lunch for sure
[10:05:41] <Hunterkll> lol i cant fucking figure out which VM has by ubiquiti controller installed
[10:06:05] <BWMerlin> IDK if I could ever touch Ubiquiti again
[10:06:20] <Hunterkll> i absolutely love 'em for what they are and for the price:feature/performance ratio
[10:06:42] <Hunterkll> but without acknowledging their shortcomings you can end up using them in ways that'll just cause heartache 
[10:06:56] <BWMerlin> Everyone keeps saying that exact same line "I can just buy a spare and keep it on the shelf".  I have had those "spares" but the issues have always been software/firmware
[10:07:31] <Hunterkll> nominally you have test equipment, of course, but yea i get that point
[10:07:42] <BWMerlin> For home I brought Mikrotik to stroke my epen
[10:07:44] <Hunterkll> that's one of the shortcomings (support/hardware) you have to acknowledge to really pinpoint where/how they'll fit good

[10:39:10] <Hunterkll> welp, destroyed and rebuilt some components and all is well now
[10:39:32] <BWMerlin> IaC, blow it away and have it rebuild
[10:40:27] <Hunterkll> yes because that's going to work so well for my desktop
[10:41:11] <Hunterkll> especially when the VMs i'm working with are prior images of my desktop before reformats
[10:41:12] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:44:46] <BWMerlin> See, if you had of changed the template and committed it to your CI/CD pipeline you wouldn't have this issue
[10:44:54] <Hunterkll> .... what?
[10:45:02] <Hunterkll> how would that fix networking failure on single host?

[10:50:19] <Hunterkll> it was in the known good configuration

[11:07:40] <xe0n> i worked out why mine rando disconnected, auto firmware upgrade :P
[11:07:56] <Hunterkll> jesus christ i bought this AP off this irc channel like 3 years ago
[11:07:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:08:37] <Hunterkll> from 4.0.54.10625 to 5.43.52.12774?
[11:08:45] <Hunterkll> might be a few AP firmware revisions behind LOL

[11:09:22] <Hunterkll>  
[11:09:37] <Hunterkll> the unifi controller version i had on the saved copy of my desktop, so i installed that and restored backup lol
[11:10:59] <Hunterkll> might as well check firmware for everything while i'm in this shit i guess
[11:10:59] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:11:42] <BWMerlin> As I said earlier "I can just keep a spare on the shelf"
[11:12:06] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: .... t his is more a result of me not giving a fuck because it's been working rock solid for over 3 years without issue
[11:12:44] <Hunterkll> talk of UBNT shit made me dig in to find which old VHDX backup of my desktop had the controller software (turns out it was DESK-3), so i took the backup and moved it on over 
[11:12:48] <Hunterkll> now i'm gonna drag it into the future
[11:13:23] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: this literally has nothing to do with ubnt's firmware/software/etc
[11:13:35] <Hunterkll> and more the fact that i never moved the controller over after reimaging my desktop sometime in 2019
[11:14:36] <Hunterkll> (this is also why I keep a VHDX of my old installs before reimaging) 
[11:15:40] <Cl0udNinja> goddamn the inside of my mouse was gross af

[11:18:10] <Hunterkll> .... and probably should do my ASA as well, so that's two cisco devices i'll have to snark firmware for

[12:16:51] <Hunterkll> that i bo ught ages ago
[12:16:52] <Hunterkll> like
[12:16:55] <Hunterkll> longer ago then you bought those reds

[12:16:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:17:04] <Hunterkll> I have no idea what was on f:
[12:17:10] <Hunterkll> but the failure mode showing 3.86GB capacity
[12:17:14] <Hunterkll> means drive is completely RIP 
[12:17:23] <Hunterkll> that's how it shows up when it fails to init properly
[12:17:32] <Hunterkll> i got an idea or two to try but lol
[12:17:56] <A-KO> This is the only drive that has reallocated sectors
[12:18:02] <Hunterkll> i have backups spanning years so since i don't know what was on the F: virtual disk means i have no icare

[12:19:59] <Hunterkll> 4tb's showing up as 3.86GB capacity

[12:20:20] <A-KO> I don't think this is going to let me remove that drive
[12:20:33] <Hunterkll> probably not
[12:20:38] <Hunterkll> the idea here is to move as much off as you can
[12:20:41] <Hunterkll> before ad ding the drive via USB
[12:20:46] <A-KO> well yeah
[12:20:48] <Hunterkll> to reduce the time to actually remove, without really reducing resiliancy
[12:21:15] <Hunterkll> "Capacity 3,86 means the drive doesn't read anything from the surface and its just using its internal service fw (from PCB).
[12:21:15] <Hunterkll> "
[12:21:21] <A-KO> I ran a set-physicaldisk retire on it, then have it running a repair-virtualdisk ; storage spaces just says "warning: add 2 drives" and "preparing for removal"
[12:21:25] <A-KO> lol
[12:21:30] <Hunterkll> yep
[12:21:31] <Hunterkll> that's normal
[12:21:32] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:21:43] <Hunterkll> so retired still counts in the resiliancy if it's online
[12:22:18] <A-KO> yeah I'm just waiting for it to say I can remove the drive, but it probably won't let me until I have the other one in first

[13:09:42] <Cl0udNinja> no
[13:09:45] <Hunterkll> no i'm saying *both* work the same way

[13:10:20] <Hunterkll> like if throttle is 10% forward, you move at 10% constant speed
[13:10:28] <Cl0udNinja> should be able to... its MechWarrior after all lol

[13:13:36] <Cl0udNinja> I'll just also get some gorilla glue :D

[13:13:58] <Hunterkll> like most of my configs have T switches on landing gear and pre-set flaps settings, etc

[13:16:20] <Hunterkll> with thrustmaster, you'd want to go with the T.16000M + TWCS Throttle (so you'd buy both) 
[13:16:25] <Hunterkll> logitech the Saitek X52 is the cheapest
[13:16:35] <Hunterkll> well
[13:16:36] <Hunterkll> okay
[13:16:44] <Hunterkll> the Extreme 3D Pro is the chepaest at like $30 all day long
[13:16:48] <Hunterkll> but you obviously don't want that 
[13:16:52] <Hunterkll> (that was the picture i showed ealrier)
[13:17:03] <Cl0udNinja> yeah dont want that
[13:17:19] <Hunterkll> so i'd call it down between the 16000m + twcs or x52 
[13:17:20] <Cl0udNinja> ngl, I was considering making like 'arm boards' that I could strap on to my arms that'd have the joysticks on them
[13:17:36] <Hunterkll> LOL

[13:18:12] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: nice thing about the logitech/saitek is that it has like, magnetic centering - it's basically floating in the base
[13:18:22] <Hunterkll> it's also like $100 cheaper than the thrustmaster combo if you buy them togther at the same time
[13:18:41] <Hunterkll> christ the 16000m hotas kit is $250
[13:18:51] <Hunterkll> and looks / specs worse than the x52 pro at $200
[13:19:26] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: tl;dr don't cheap out, but it's not as expensive as say, the warthog, to get something that'll last you a long damn time
[13:19:30] <Hunterkll> my x52 pro was purchased in 2014 
[13:19:41] <Cl0udNinja> why the fuck is the x52 black $50 more expensive
[13:19:45] <Cl0udNinja> IT TAKES FUCKING LESS TOOLING
[13:19:53] <xe0n> once you go black you never go back
[13:20:05] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: hm? I didn't know the X52 came in black 
[13:20:09] <Hunterkll> i thought that was only the X52 Pro
[13:20:16] <Cl0udNinja> oh yeah thats why
[13:20:19] <Cl0udNinja> I didnt see the 'pro'
[13:20:27] <Cl0udNinja> wtf is the difference
[13:20:51] *** Joins: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm)
[13:21:25] <Cl0udNinja> it looks so much better in black than it does black/silver >.>
[13:21:25] <xe0n> bigger

[13:21:49] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: also the radio stack display being more programmable, shit like that
[13:22:13] <Hunterkll> for you, not really much difference i suppose
[13:22:17] <Hunterkll> it'll feel nicer, i guess, but that's it
[13:23:06] <Hunterkll> it's basically just the X52 but with upgraded internals
[13:23:30] <Cl0udNinja> hmmm
[13:23:41] <Cl0udNinja> microcenter has both available in stock at a store
[13:23:51] <Hunterkll> yep they are extremely popular
[13:24:00] <Cl0udNinja> bestbuy didnt have them in stock though
[13:24:02] <Cl0udNinja> strangely
[13:24:04] <Hunterkll> because your next step up is basically into the $500-600+ range
[13:24:11] <Hunterkll> minimum
[13:24:12] <Cl0udNinja> nearest microcenter is far af
[13:25:14] <Hunterkll> with thurstmaster i've always heard - except the warthog - to get a different vendor's throttle and just get the TM joystick
[13:25:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:25:20] <Hunterkll> so that's a fun parade of mix and match
[13:25:30] <Cl0udNinja> actually, its closer than I thought it was, but still, far enough for me not to be tempted to go often
[13:25:34] <Cl0udNinja> THURSTMASTER

[13:25:55] <Hunterkll> looking at the market now
[13:25:59] <Hunterkll> it really hasn't changed in the past like 15 years
[13:26:06] <Hunterkll> 2008 i'd have been lusting after the X52 even then
[13:26:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:26:14] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:26:37] <Cl0udNinja> maybe I'll just take a trip and go see if they have any on display so I can see how they feel/function
[13:26:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:26:44] <Hunterkll> but yea
[13:26:46] <Hunterkll> probably not
[13:26:57] <Hunterkll> either way, logitech has an immediate $20 off on their website right now for the non-pro 
[13:27:10] <Hunterkll> the pro's got more metal construction too
[13:27:24] <Cl0udNinja> eh, I probably wont buy online
[13:27:35] <Cl0udNinja> controllers and stuff I gotta feel before I buy
[13:27:36] <Hunterkll> yea better to have that easy return window :P
[13:27:48] <Hunterkll> but i really dont recall seeing joysticks up for playing with in microcenters
[13:27:58] <Hunterkll> and ive been to ones in maryland, ohio, and california
[13:28:01] <Cl0udNinja> on similar note, hacking my mouse to flip the 4/5 and dpi/doubletap buttons would be hard af and not worth it unfortunately

[13:30:17] <Hunterkll> except the button on the scrollwheel 
[13:30:27] <Hunterkll> that just unlatches a mechanical lock that lets the scroll wheel free spin
[13:30:32] <Hunterkll> instead of having a clicky drag like normal
[13:30:40] <Cl0udNinja> I was just wanting to switch the dpi/doubletap and 4/5 buttons around
[13:31:00] <Cl0udNinja> but the traces are too small and I'd have a hell of a time making it work

[13:33:27] <Cl0udNinja> yeh, they put the stupid dpi/doubletap buttons next to the left click, and like I mentioned, the 4/5 buttons on mine are fucking designed for aliens
[13:33:45] <Hunterkll> yea dpi button is literally under your thumb normally
[13:34:02] <Hunterkll> with dpi up/down under your left click finger, and back/forward (browser functions in stock) above your thumb
[13:34:29] <Hunterkll> g hub software can auto-switch profile based on current running game, and you can save profiles to the mouse for use on oth er systems
[13:34:33] <Cl0udNinja> yeah they put the thumb ones WAY too far up/forward to be useful by any human, it was something I hadnt noticed when I was buying it
[13:35:11] <Hunterkll> it also has an adjustable weight set for moving balance around and increasing/reducing drag
[13:35:26] <Cl0udNinja> I've got average size man hands, and I still have to either manhandle the mouse, or really shift my thumb up to push the 4/5 buttons
[13:35:32] <Cl0udNinja> jfc
[13:35:37] <Cl0udNinja> thats too much in a mouse lmao

[13:36:57] <Hunterkll> ^ You can assign any dumb shit to it
[13:36:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:37:08] <Hunterkll> now instead of DPI and back/forth i have new, paste, and cut
[13:37:09] <Hunterkll> :D
[13:37:18] <Cl0udNinja> yeah but can I assign a quick dial to ur mum for button 4? :D
[13:37:52] <Hunterkll> so yea, everything's programmable however you want it
[13:37:58] <Hunterkll> been on the G502 train since 2016 
[13:38:14] <Cl0udNinja> I dont use the DPI one often, but I found it useful recently when playing HMG in Squad, otherwise I always have it at max sensitivity
[13:38:28] <Hunterkll> yikes
[13:38:37] <Hunterkll> i can't imagine trying to even remotely play a game with 25k DPI 
[13:38:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:38:56] <Hunterkll> i crank mine down to 400 / 200 cut when playing competition/tournaments and people think that's absurdly high
[13:39:13] <Cl0udNinja> eh, the guns in squad will put you pointing upward within a few shots if you're really givin it the beans
[13:39:44] <Cl0udNinja> even with my dpi at max I still run out of mouse pad before emptying a mag
[13:39:50] <Hunterkll> heh
[13:39:54] <Hunterkll> with this mouse you wouldn't
[13:39:58] <Hunterkll> you'd be shooting your dick off instead
[13:40:03] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:40:48] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: to be fair, i'm comparing a $50-80 mouse to a $10 mouse
[13:40:49] <Hunterkll> sooo : P
[13:40:56] <Cl0udNinja> true
[13:41:01] <Hunterkll> yer mouse does 625 to 2500 dpi
[13:41:23] <Hunterkll> my mouse does "fuck am i even moving" to "jesus christ i circumnavigatd the world in an inch"
[13:42:08] <Hunterkll> well, 625-2,500 compared to 100-25,600 
[13:42:19] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[13:42:45] <Hunterkll> still, got mine in the radioshack bankruptcy and can't say anything really bad abo ut it other than lack of buttons 
[13:43:07] <Hunterkll> but I got the G600 to fix that for games that require it 
[13:43:18] <Cl0udNinja> I just cant really justify spending that much, even if I can afford it 1000x over. its just... idk... I came from not having much money lol
[13:43:22] <Hunterkll> which has 12 buttons on the side under the htumb 
[13:43:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:43:37] <Hunterkll> but it's made for MMO gaming so 
[13:44:04] <Hunterkll> *shrug* Like I said, mine's 5 years old and kickin'
[13:44:19] <Hunterkll> i bought a spare for travel, but that's just because i travel to places where gaming is a requirement
[13:44:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:45:33] <Hunterkll> abut yea you can get the G502 for like 30-40 if you look around and catch it
[13:45:37] <Hunterkll> the wired one anyway

[20:12:30] <signalblue> youtube is suprisingly usable..... over a dial-up connection?
[20:12:32] <signalblue> odd
[20:12:46] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> thats quic for you
[20:13:28] <signalblue> yeah
[20:13:39] <signalblue> i mean a lot of other stuff works wellish
[20:13:50] <signalblue> just slow but I can live with it
[20:18:51] <Hunterkll> that's not quic....
[20:19:05] <Hunterkll> that's 1980s tech working properly
[20:19:37] <signalblue> more like tech from the 1800's
[20:20:17] <signalblue> analog voice from the Alexander Graham Bell era
[20:22:22] <signalblue> i mean it's just a gigabit fiber link with firefox running under netlimiter capped at 56kbps up and down
[20:22:49] <signalblue> faux dial-up
[20:23:27] <csws> add 300-500 ms latency to enhance the effect
[20:23:46] <csws> oh also drop that down to about 48 kbps
[20:24:00] <csws> that was the highest speed I ever got on dialup
[20:24:05] <signalblue> it's really 53kbps realistically
[20:24:13] <signalblue> and you're 22, not old enough
[20:24:17] <csws> and make sure you empty the cache when reloading
[20:24:18] <signalblue> or something like that
[20:24:30] <csws> what?
[20:24:36] <signalblue> 27?
[20:24:44] <signalblue> in your 20's
[20:24:46] <csws> I'm 25
[20:24:49] <signalblue> ah
[20:24:56] <csws> I had dialup for waaay longer than I should've
[20:25:01] <signalblue> ohhhh
[20:25:05] <signalblue> painful
[20:25:07] <csws> til 2008
[20:25:08] <csws> yeah
[20:25:11] <signalblue> wait why?
[20:25:16] <signalblue> because australia?
[20:25:22] <csws> my dad was a total cheapskate
[20:25:22] <signalblue> rural
[20:25:25] <signalblue> oh
[20:25:27] <signalblue> LOL
[20:25:30] <Hunterkll> lol dialup in 2008
[20:25:32] <csws> when I got adsl 2+ it was nuts lol
[20:25:37] <csws> sync was like 18 mbps
[20:25:38] <csws> I went wild
[20:25:41] <signalblue> yeah
[20:25:43] <Hunterkll> man i had dsl and cable in those days
[20:25:51] <Hunterkll> 2005 i was forced to dialup

[20:26:20] <signalblue> dial-up in 2005 is still a bit odd tbh
[20:27:13] <signalblue> I limited mIRC to 33.6kbps up/down and it was completely fine
[20:30:51] <Telgareith> I got 15/2 FiOS as soon as it was rolled out
[20:31:02] <Telgareith> literally preordered it
