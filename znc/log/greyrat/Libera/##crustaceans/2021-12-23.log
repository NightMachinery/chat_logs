[00:00:26] <imode> I feel like this is going to end the same way Endgame ended.
[00:00:34] <imode> with a diversity setup.
[00:01:25] <imode> it's all about redacting the previous three films in terms of tone, setting and narrative with leagues of CGI, expository dialogue and callbacks that make you wish you were just watching the previous films.
[00:01:46] <imode> could've been a marvel movie.
[00:02:55] <imode> there won't be another one.
[00:03:34] <manicennui> It will all depend on how it does financially.
[00:03:46] <manicennui> Movies haven't needed to be good to get sequels for a while.
[00:03:47] <imode> it's not gonna do well financially.
[00:04:09] <imode> most of you were right. this is a blatant cash grab.
[00:05:33] <imode> there was something good there, _right near the beginning_, that I genuinely didn't recognize. there was some narrative about escapism that I feel like could've been a genuine plot about how, despite how the chips fell, people still became addicted.
[00:06:12] <imode> and then it just fell apart.
[00:07:22] <manicennui> Now watch Titane.
[00:07:47] <imode> "women used to be so easy to control"
[00:07:51] <imode> okay.
[00:08:48] <imode> manicennui: what's Titane.
[00:09:02] <manicennui> I don't know how to describe it without spoiling it.
[00:09:20] <manicennui> If you like fucked up, weird movies, you will probably like it.
[00:09:34] <manicennui> "Following a series of unexplained crimes, a father is reunited with the son who has been missing for 10 years"
[00:09:44] <manicennui> That's the official description, and gives away basically nothing.
[00:10:07] <manicennui> It's one of those movies with a high "WTF" count.
[00:10:23] <manicennui> And nervous laughing at the absurdity.
[00:10:24] <imode> is it "WTF"s for the sake of WTFs, or..
[00:10:44] <manicennui> It's not just a shock fest.
[00:10:53] <manicennui> I liked it a lot.

[00:11:46] <indigo> imode: Is that actually a quote from the movie??
[00:11:46] <manicennui> I don't even know that you need to do the Hollywood Formula anymore.
[00:11:54] <imode> indigo: yes.
[00:11:56] <manicennui> You just need certain elements now.
[00:11:58] <indigo> Jeez
[00:12:17] <manicennui> For action, you need lots of dumb CGI.
[00:12:27] <manicennui> And some popular names.
[00:12:34] <manicennui> Almost nothing else matters.
[00:12:42] <manicennui> Maybe some quips.
[00:12:55] <dminkovsky> i dunno every movie i watch follows it
[00:12:57] <imode> indigo: it goes far worse at a lot of points.
[00:13:01] <imode> a _lot_ of points.
[00:13:23] <imode> it genuinely feels like a fanfiction.
[00:14:44] <imode> are you fu-
[00:15:17] <imode> this is so dumb.
[00:15:42] <imode> it's now just spectacle. like all of it, just spectacle.
[00:16:11] <manicennui> So pretty much like the other sequels.
[00:17:09] <imode> at least the jesus narrative was coherent.
[00:17:26] <imode> the minimal effort would've been appreciated.
[00:17:45] <imode> there's enough spectacle here that would genuinely make you forget what you're watching.

[00:19:03] <imode> if this ends with what I think it's going to end with I'm cancelling my HBO Max subscription.
[00:19:09] <manicennui> heh
[00:19:29] <manicennui> It ends with Neo working at Meta on the metaverse.
[00:19:34] <imode> ...
[00:19:36] <imode> I mean.
[00:19:39] <manicennui> And the whole thing took place in the metaverse.
[00:19:42] <imode> it doesn't _end_ with that.
[00:21:00] <manicennui> And Carrie-Anne Moss plays his boss whom he has a crush on.

[00:26:29] <imode> THIS MOVIE JUST USED THE WORD "SHEEPLE".
[00:26:36] <indigo> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
[00:26:37] <imode> I'm out.
[00:26:43] <indigo> That bad huh?
[00:26:48] <imode> oh it's bad.
[00:26:54] <imode> the ending is so bad.
[00:27:14] <imode> please do not end with RATM.
[00:27:24] <imode> it's.. ending with RATM.
[00:27:41] <manicennui> Rage Against The (lack of) Money
[00:27:42] <imode> don't make another one.
[00:28:14] <indigo> They always end with RATM though, right
[00:28:20] <indigo> It's like a Matrix thing
[00:28:22] <imode> they do not.
[00:28:27] <imode> okay.
[00:28:33] <imode> this was a sax rap cover of wake up.
[00:28:44] <indigo> What's your rating, out of 5 stars
[00:28:52] <imode> if I could give it a negative I would.
[00:29:25] <manicennui> Wake Up was kind of the perfect thing at the end of the first movie.
[00:29:36] <manicennui> Especially the first time you saw it.
[00:29:55] <manicennui> I was blown away by the movie, and then that song came on and got me even more pumped up.
[00:30:12] <imode> I have to take a walk because that was genuinely so terrible I need to purge my memory of it.
[00:30:15] <imode> brb.
[00:30:57] <dminkovsky> that's the matrix for ya

[00:44:18] <dminkovsky> so weird
[00:45:14] <dminkovsky> if you request a "sensitive scope", they let you have it, BUT, for a max up 100 users for the lifetime of your app
[00:45:41] <dminkovsky> not sure that makes sense
[01:24:13] <Brekkjern> I started watching For All Mankind, and I think maaaaaybe imode drew the shorter straw :P

[01:55:55] <imode> it's hard to contain my disdain for the new matrix movie, and it's certainly not because it's got bad writing, bad acting, bad pacing. no, it's the fact that it mocks you for 50 minutes.
[01:56:17] <imode> not passively, mind you. actively. it actively shames you for being a fan of the franchise, or even someone who likes it.
[01:56:26] <imode> it actively calls you out for even wanting to see the film.
[01:56:57] <imode> it has this general attitude of "fuck you pay me" that expands even to the end credits scene. which, fuck it, here it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4MZqWmE_p0

[01:57:39] <imode> wait that somehow doesn't have it. whatever. it's two dudes that mocked you previously saying that they should make a series of cat videos called "the catrix".
[01:57:42] <imode> and then it cuts to black.
[01:57:45] <imode> I saved you three minutes.
[01:58:45] <imode> if your aim was to shit on practically all prior art of the matrix, you've absolutely done so. not because of my opinion, but because that was the outward, verbal intent.
[01:59:27] <imode> spoiler alert for those who're gonna watch it: they replay the exact moment that warner brothers requested they make matrix 4. it's almost as if the lone wichowski is crying out for help and/or mocking us, because.. _they are_.

[02:00:41] <manicennui> imode: So you recommend seeing it.
[02:01:30] <imode> go for it. by all means, if you have an HBO Max subscription, watch it. watch it if only to cure your morbid curiosity, which, ironically, the movie outwardly mocks.
[02:01:58] <imode> if you don't have a subscription, don't get one. don't go to the movies. don't buy any copy of it. pirate it in the spirit of the original films.
[02:02:10] <manicennui> What if the director didn't want to make the movie, but did it anyways and commented on the fact that she did with the movie?
[02:03:02] <imode> if you didn't want to make it, don't make it.
[02:03:17] <manicennui> But money
[02:03:25] <imode> then you wanted to make it. for money.
[02:03:37] <manicennui> I know that some directors make some movies in exchange for doing what they really want to do.
[02:04:00] <imode> yeah, I'm not watching a new wachowski film for as long as I breathe.
[02:04:18] <manicennui> But I think that the Wachowski movies just aren't very good with a few exceptions.
[02:05:53] <imode> the plot synopsis on wikipedia is about all you need. you don't need to watch the fucking movie.
[02:25:32] <imode> I told my friend the plot and he still couldn't believe it.

[03:41:16] <dminkovsky> well, mostly joking
[03:41:21] <dminkovsky> it was an okay time
[03:46:36] <manicennui> There was nothing wrong with pets.com
[03:46:44] <manicennui> Other than the fact that they didn't make enough money to survive

[05:34:14] <dminkovsky> i copied all the photos and videos from my iphone to a hard disk. "Image Capture" says there are 4,914 items on the the phone. the directory i copied them to now has 4,997 items
[05:34:54] <dminkovsky> presuming one of those extras is a .DS_Store, what is the rest? who knows
[05:41:54] <dminkovsky> hmm looks like tarsnap is written in C
[05:43:31] <ivan> dminkovsky: when you copy straight out of the DCIM folder, you also get the short 'live' clips as well as the color adjustment profiles
[05:44:03] <ivan> in Photos on iOS those aren't counted separately
[05:44:39] <dminkovsky> hey ivan yeah that's probably it!
[05:44:56] <dminkovsky> you can view the DCIM folder on macos?
[05:45:00] <ivan> yes

[05:46:49] <buttsbot> How can I access DCIM file on Mac - Apple Community
[05:46:59] <dminkovsky> oh well i tihnk your'e right anyway ivan, that makes a lot of sense
[06:04:07] <dminkovsky> ahh rclone https://rclone.org/ this is the one i've been meaning to try as well
[06:04:07] <buttsbot> Rclone
[06:05:44] <dminkovsky> but it's not deduplicating like borg
[06:12:41] <dminkovsky> looks like the two are complementary
[06:13:33] <dminkovsky> then push them to clouds w/ rclone
[06:13:49] <dminkovsky> instead of having to use multiple cloud-specific utils, which is fine too
[06:14:22] <ivan> I implemented a filesystem on top of postgresql and have multiple storage backends
[06:14:57] <ivan> rclone is good though. except for not keeping its metadata local
[06:16:14] <dminkovsky> ivan: why did you implement a filesystem on postgres?
[06:16:25] <ivan> git-annex solves this problem if you have a reasonable number of files, like hundreds of thousands or something
[06:16:52] <ivan> dminkovsky: I was storing hundreds of millions of files in one of the big clouds
[06:17:19] <dminkovsky> so you store the DB files instead?
[06:18:24] <ivan> I keep my inode metadata and dirents in my postgresql and treat the remote storage as encrypted blob stores
[06:18:44] <dminkovsky> that is cool
[06:18:55] <dminkovsky> very cool
[06:19:58] <dminkovsky> with that system, you can add the blogs to your local FS representation, then ship off the blobs, and remove the blobs locally?
[06:20:11] <dminkovsky> blobs*
[06:20:54] <dminkovsky> god anytimes i install anything w/ brew it upgrades like every library it's terrible
[06:21:06] <ivan> yeah, I have a command-line interface that basically replicates the local directory structure into postgresql when you `add` a file. the obvious thing
[06:21:22] <dminkovsky> tesseract, cairo, x264, x265, why are all of these being upgrades :/
[06:21:45] <dminkovsky> ivan:  does it do any sort of deduplication?
[06:21:49] <ivan> nope
[06:22:02] <dminkovsky> very neat though
[06:22:13] <ivan> it _could_ because I take the b3sum of everything now, but it wasn't part of the original design
[06:22:19] <ivan> that would be whole-file
[06:24:22] <dminkovsky> oh: "==> Upgrading 21 dependents: Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK. "
[06:24:30] <dminkovsky> brew is insane
[06:25:02] <dminkovsky> i'd rather one or two things break than having a cascade of out of controlled updates that will inevitably break everything
[06:25:11] <dminkovsky> i need to run guix or nix or something
[06:27:53] <dminkovsky> we all need a system like ivan's
[06:28:13] <dminkovsky> having to maintain a full local copy of your data becomes impossible

[15:05:26] <kline> epilys | maybe ESL? classical has different meanings in other languages
[15:05:32] <kline> its actually written in ancient greek
[15:06:00] <epilys> well classical/classic in greek means the same thing for example
[15:06:13] <epilys> so a greek speaker could easily say classical for stuff not related to the classics
[15:06:55] <kline> in english, classic/classical means something akin to traditional
[15:07:37] <kline> or early
[15:07:46] <kline> for example, classical ballet, mechanics, etc
[15:08:32] <kline> i understand "the classics" as in to study classics means really to study latin/greek but only because these were the traditional/early forms of scholarship in the "modern" western scholarship anyway
[15:09:42] <epilys> Yeah but there's also the colloquial meaning of tradition "oh Pamela did this? Classic Pam."
[15:10:24] <epilys> JS in ancient greek would be weird to see
[15:10:26] <kline> to me thats just "traditional/stereotypical"
[15:10:30] <epilys> ye
[15:10:34] <epilys> bingo
[15:10:46] <epilys> you're a native speaker right kline ?
[15:10:52] <kline> yes
[15:11:04] <kline> which isnt always a good thing when it comes to understanding a language
[15:11:29] <epilys> It just implies a certain level of familiarity
[15:14:02] <Brekkjern> I've spent way too long trying to make a joke out of native speakers not knowing the difference between you're and your and such...
[15:14:05] <Brekkjern> Just pretend I made one...

[15:59:04] <kline> oh, its unreleased
[16:01:01] <epilys> kline, yeah you're on the main branch
[16:01:19] <epilys> you can clone the main branch and build the docs locally if you need that
[16:02:12] <kline> one unhappiness i have with rust is how much stuff needs nightly or even future stuff
[16:02:38] <epilys> futures is still being worked on though the basics are stable
[16:02:49] <epilys> what do you need to do that requires nightly?
[16:03:03] <epilys> for meli I'm using all stable future stuff
[16:03:46] <kline> i dont mean "futures"
[16:03:50] <kline> i mean stuff thats unreleased
[16:05:01] <epilys> ah
[16:05:09] <epilys> well what do you need in particular?
[16:05:14] <epilys> im curious
[16:13:48] <kline> theres a load of crates that require it
[16:13:57] <kline> i dont use rust enough to list them off hand
[16:14:12] <kline> but ive never had a stable toolchain installed
[16:25:58] <epilys> interesting, I do lots of rust stuff and I've had the opposite experience
[16:41:41] <prussian> I only use rust in a hobby capacity and just use unstable + experimental features.
[16:41:43] <prussian> lol
[16:47:40] <kline> yeah
[16:47:50] <kline> im a hobby rust user and i use exclusively experimental
[16:48:15] <kline> you should see my println!-free, conditional-free, math-free fizzbuzz
[16:48:33] <kline> (i actually have something like this in python)
[16:55:27] <prussian> damn
[17:12:52] <epilys> itertools? cycle etc
[17:12:54] <epilys> generators
[17:32:07] <dminkovsky> "classical" and "classic" are pretty different words
[17:32:31] <dminkovsky> that sentence would make more sense with "classic"--though still not a great word choice
[17:33:00] <dminkovsky> pretty fun discussing words like "classic" with a native greek speaker though :)
[17:33:30] <dminkovsky> although hey as i suspected, that word is from latin
[17:33:59] <dminkovsky> "classis" -> "classiscus" -> "classic" (early 16th cenutry)
[17:34:56] <dminkovsky> my internet blows; 600-800KB/s upstream
[17:37:13] <epilys> dminkovsky, yeah, that's what I said/implied
[17:38:42] <dminkovsky> epilys: you ever been to the US? i lived in a place called "Astoria" in New York that is a greek neighborhood
[17:38:51] <dminkovsky> maybe less so than 20 years ago
[17:38:56] <dminkovsky> is it known in greece?
[17:39:32] <dminkovsky> Brighton Beach, NY, for example, is widely known in the russian world as the russian area in new york
[17:50:49] <epilys> dminkovsky, the ny one no, but astoria is a common toponymic
[17:52:14] <epilys> I don't think the average greek ever thinks about the diaspora
[17:52:36] <epilys> they are regarded ridiculous, especially after My Big Fat Greek Wedding
[17:52:48] <dminkovsky> that movie was bad
[17:52:57] <epilys> yea
[17:53:04] <dminkovsky> was it offensive in greece?
[17:53:25] <epilys> more like making fun of greek americans, not greeks
[17:54:38] <dminkovsky> heh
[17:54:46] <Xe> i'm so lucky i got synchronous gigabit fiber
[17:54:46] <epilys> americans are despised in greece

[17:55:33] <dminkovsky> what for
[17:55:39] <dminkovsky> except our general american-ness
[17:55:47] <dminkovsky> anything in particular?
[17:56:23] <dminkovsky> and like what about germans, or the english?
[17:56:34] <epilys> the CIA had its hands in the military coup in the 60s

[17:56:38] <buttsbot> Greek junta - Wikipedia
[17:56:42] <dminkovsky> ah
[17:56:52] <epilys> also, they supported Turkey's invasion of Cyprus I think?
[17:57:31] <epilys> Fun fact: The greek junta hosted L. Ron Hubbard's ship while he was on the run from the USA authorities for a while
[17:57:41] <dminkovsky> lol
[17:57:43] <epilys> until they realised what a psycho he was and ousted him
[17:58:11] <dminkovsky> so they got support from the CIA but then decided to host an american fugitive anyway?
[17:58:46] <epilys> they might have thought he would give them money, dunno
[17:59:37] <epilys> don't look for reason in dictators
[17:59:57] <dminkovsky> i'm not heh
[18:00:03] <dminkovsky> it's funny that the CIA did, though ;)
[18:00:26] <dminkovsky> Papadopoulos wasn't the first installed dictator that didn't work out for the CIA
[18:00:38] <dminkovsky> basically every dictator we installed didn't work out
[18:00:41] <epilys> CIA and coups are kind of like a thing
[18:00:43] <epilys> yeah
[18:01:28] <epilys> btw, unrelated, but there was a wiretapping scandal some years ago in Greece, all the government's mobile phones were found to be tapped from their service provider (Vodafone)
[18:01:52] <epilys> then the technician involved killed himself, the wiretap was traced back to the American Embassy and then all investigations ceased
[18:01:58] <dminkovsky> heh
[18:02:02] <dminkovsky> jeez
[18:02:08] <dminkovsky> i had not heard about that
[18:02:13] <epilys> but until that happened it was all over the news all the time
[18:02:29] <epilys> it's funny how quickly it was forgotten by the news cycle once the perpetrator was revealed
[18:02:56] <dminkovsky> the technician or the united state? ;)

[19:56:22] <manicennui> So much so that even Republicans started getting scared.
[19:56:24] <dminkovsky> what stopped them
[19:56:33] <dminkovsky> what are you referring to
[19:56:41] <dminkovsky> i am officially taking the next few days half to full off
[19:56:52] <dminkovsky> i should set up and out of office autoresponder
[19:56:58] <dminkovsky> just for good measure
[19:57:33] <dminkovsky> manicennui: am curious what you're referring to though
[19:57:45] <manicennui> I think they defunded crap to a level that it started to have major impacts, and then everyone was like, "Oh shit!"
[19:57:55] <dminkovsky> somtimes i want to spell refering with one R in honor of the HTTP header typo but i'm afriad no one will get it
[19:58:15] <dminkovsky> manicennui: so, like texas?
[19:59:24] <manicennui> I think they managed to go even further than Texas, and they don't have the economy that Texas does.

[20:00:17] <manicennui> Oh, sorry.
[20:00:20] <manicennui> Found it a moment later.
[20:01:14] <dminkovsky> i have a strong anti-social tendency that kind of loves stuff like this
[20:01:16] <manicennui> Even setting that aside, Kansas is not great.
[20:02:12] <dminkovsky> sometimes i wish there would be a "technocractic" administration that dedicated its entire term to going through everything and seeing what needed to be kept
[20:02:17] <dminkovsky> it's a pretty peurile concept
[20:02:26] <dminkovsky> but it's attractive to me
[20:02:27] <manicennui> dminkovsky: I mean, that is kind of what Obama was.
[20:02:36] <dminkovsky> was it?
[20:02:38] <manicennui> But nothing can be done unilaterally.
[20:02:46] <manicennui> dminkovsky: He had really smart policy people.
[20:02:50] <dminkovsky> :/
[20:03:11] <dminkovsky> obama's whole thing was equating dollars spent to how much you care about something
[20:03:18] <dminkovsky> blindly expecting results for dollars spent
[20:03:35] <manicennui> I think that is just playing American politics.
[20:03:36] <dminkovsky> every sentence that came out of his mouth was like "we spent 30 million dollars on ____"
[20:03:41] <dminkovsky> implying that if you spend you get results
[20:04:07] <dminkovsky> which i don't believe to be an accurate assumption
[20:04:09] <manicennui> If you spend and don't get some kind of results, it is kind of a problem.
[20:04:11] <indigo> dminkovsky: There are some Chromebooks that are comparable in price with Macs (eg https://www.google.com/chromebook/device/google-pixelbook-go-8gb-128gb/)
[20:04:12] <buttsbot> Error 404 (Not Found)!!1
[20:04:14] <manicennui> Not saying spending is the solution to all problems.
[20:04:29] <ngoldbaum> an obama administration where he had a functioning congress would have been interesting
[20:04:43] <manicennui> But I don't think you can be purely logical either.
[20:04:53] <manicennui> See Asimov's Foundation series.
[20:04:54] <dminkovsky> lol buttsbot "!!1"
[20:05:16] <indigo> ngoldbaum: I'm still amazed that the ACA managed to pass
[20:05:17] <dminkovsky> yeah that's why i refered to my sentiments are peurile
[20:05:30] <manicennui> indigo: The thing that I have never understood about Chromebooks is why they are almost as expensive as Macs.
[20:05:32] <dminkovsky> i'm like jimmy smith going to washington
[20:05:48] <dminkovsky> they started costing $300
[20:05:51] <ngoldbaum> indigo: he had a 60 vote majority in the senate and it still barely passed
[20:05:55] <dminkovsky> they killed the every kid laptop
[20:06:06] <dminkovsky> the ACA sucked
[20:06:12] <dminkovsky> i started hating obama immediately cause of the ACA
[20:06:12] <ngoldbaum> the OLPC was garbage tho
[20:06:18] <dminkovsky> he flexed and got the ACA?
[20:06:19] <indigo> manicennui: Not all of them. But I also wonder why the expensive ones exist
[20:06:21] <manicennui> They gutted ACA to please Republicans and people in their own party.
[20:06:25] <dminkovsky> i know
[20:06:35] <dminkovsky> they should have gone single payer or GTFO
[20:06:42] <dminkovsky> he didn't rise to the occasion at all
[20:06:43] <ngoldbaum> tbh i’m mostly happy with my ACA health insurance
[20:06:55] <manicennui> indigo: That one you linked to is $849. M1 MBAs start at $999.
[20:07:17] <indigo> Yes, I am aware
[20:07:19] <manicennui> ACA has the overall impact that it sought: tens of millions more people have health insurance.
[20:07:35] <dminkovsky> yes that's very good, but the correct way to do that was single payer
[20:07:44] <manicennui> And Republicans spent over a decade blocking any changes to it.
[20:07:51] <manicennui> So there is no reason to listen to them anymore.
[20:07:53] <dminkovsky> the tens of millions insured cost more per capital for worse healthcare than anywhere in the world
[20:07:57] <indigo> Single payer wouldn't have passed
[20:08:00] <dminkovsky> all for pleasing insurance company cronies
[20:08:11] <manicennui> The idiots wouldn't even repeal it when they had control of everything.
[20:08:14] <ngoldbaum> dminkovsky: blame lieberman, not obama
[20:08:23] <dminkovsky> avigdor lieberman?
[20:08:25] <manicennui> It's like they want it to exist as a punching bag.
[20:08:37] <ngoldbaum> joe lieberman
[20:08:39] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Health insurance was not good before ACA.
[20:08:41] <dminkovsky> ;)
[20:08:45] <ngoldbaum> they needed his vote
[20:08:48] <dminkovsky> it definitely was not
[20:08:50] <manicennui> Everyone seems to have this fantasy that health insurance was good for someone before ACA.
[20:08:58] <dminkovsky> and it's definitely better now
[20:09:02] <manicennui> It was going up every year for a decade or more before ACA.
[20:09:14] <manicennui> It's not better. There are just more people who have access.
[20:09:17] <dminkovsky> but the current system is still a complete, total disaster
[20:09:23] <indigo> I mean, it's still going up in price
[20:09:27] <manicennui> Well, I take that back.
[20:09:28] <dminkovsky> the "market" he did was insane
[20:09:29] <indigo> Every year it gets worse
[20:09:33] <dminkovsky> free market healthare is insane
[20:09:41] <manicennui> Some of the other things that were passed, like the ban on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions are amazing.
[20:09:48] <dminkovsky> obama, like trump, was a person who just fundamentally wanted to be liked
[20:09:48] <buttsbot> That's Cheeto Benito to you!
[20:10:08] <manicennui> There are some things we just take for granted now that were fucking crazy before.
[20:10:09] <dminkovsky> the pre-existing condition thing was the best thing obama did, imo
[20:10:22] <dminkovsky> i can't think of a close second
[20:10:38] <dminkovsky> is there one?
[20:10:39] <manicennui> dminkovsky: They also drastically reduced the ability to rescind policies.
[20:10:50] <manicennui> And I believe got rid of lifetime caps.
[20:11:08] <manicennui> dminkovsky: They all do tons of stuff that no one remembers.
[20:11:10] <dminkovsky> within a free market framework though
[20:11:43] <dminkovsky> those are good things, yes
[20:11:43] <manicennui> "In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act."
[20:12:00] <manicennui> "Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president."
[20:12:05] <dminkovsky> that's good but if we're talkign about that kind of stuff
[20:12:14] <dminkovsky> i can't help but remember all the people he droned
[20:12:23] <dminkovsky> and i can't help but remember that guantamo bay is still open
[20:12:26] <indigo> No one is perfect
[20:12:28] <manicennui> dminkovsky: The drones were some new thing.
[20:12:32] <dminkovsky> all cause he wanted to be re-elected
[20:12:32] <manicennui> weren't
[20:12:40] <dminkovsky> killing people with drones is beyond the pale for me
[20:12:41] <manicennui> He continued our bad foreign policy.
[20:12:49] <manicennui> And the drone stuff never ended up Trump.
[20:12:51] <dminkovsky> i can't deal with that
[20:12:54] <manicennui> He just reduced access to information.
[20:13:01] <manicennui> And everyone was focused on his daily shenanigans.
[20:13:02] <ngoldbaum> (biden ended the drone strikes, fwiw)
[20:13:17] <dminkovsky> has he?
[20:13:30] <dminkovsky> if so that's great
[20:13:31] <ngoldbaum> yeah there have been almost zero aiui
[20:13:34] <manicennui> Obama actually drastically expanded information to the public on such things.
[20:13:35] <dminkovsky> wait was that a joke
[20:13:40] <ngoldbaum> no really
[20:13:42] <dminkovsky> didn't he drone 7 kids on the way out of kabul
[20:13:50] <ngoldbaum> there was the one when we pulled out of afghanistan yeah
[20:13:53] <dminkovsky> tbh they should ban airstrikes
[20:13:57] <dminkovsky> is my opinion
[20:14:04] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Who should?
[20:14:06] <dminkovsky> outside the bounds of conventional war
[20:14:10] <manicennui> What would that even mean?
[20:14:13] <dminkovsky> humanity, and in particular the united states
[20:14:28] <manicennui> We wouldn't handicap ourselves.
[20:14:28] <ngoldbaum> dminkovsky: https://theweek.com/foreign-policy/1007579/biden-nearly-ended-the-drone-war-and-nobody-noticed?amp
[20:14:28] <dminkovsky> that means that unless you're engaged in battlefield combat, airstrikes are a warcrime
[20:14:37] <manicennui> Perhaps you should look at our votes on similar subjects in the UN.
[20:14:43] <manicennui> We aren't nice guys.
[20:14:55] <indigo> Heh, Israel is planning a 4th vaccine dose
[20:14:58] <dminkovsky> airstrikes are not so different from sarin gas imo
[20:15:07] <dminkovsky> so is germany
[20:15:16] <dminkovsky> and the UK i believe
[20:15:34] <dminkovsky> i blieve israel is already administering the 4th dose to ppl who want it
[20:15:47] <dminkovsky> well big ups to biden
[20:15:53] <manicennui> dminkovsky: The other thing that I find baffling is that people are upset about drones, but during the previous administration we used drones and a FUCKTON OF AIRPLANEs.
[20:15:56] <ngoldbaum> max titering here we come
[20:16:09] <manicennui> Like is it better if we bomb them with F35s?
[20:16:16] <dminkovsky> that's why i said airstrikes
[20:16:17] <indigo> The name's Max, Max Titering
[20:16:35] <manicennui> Overall it's pretty amazing how little blame Bush gets for all of that shit.
[20:16:38] <dminkovsky> F35s should be scappd and sold for parts ;)
[20:16:40] <indigo> I honestly should take today off
[20:16:45] <indigo> There is zero work getting done
[20:16:51] <dminkovsky> indigo: do it, i did it ;)
[20:17:03] <indigo> dminkovsky: Do you even have vacation time for it??
[20:17:08] <dminkovsky> i'm going to go for a walk and read a book
[20:17:15] <dminkovsky> indigo: FMLA
[20:17:17] <dminkovsky> i went nuclear
[20:17:30] <manicennui> dminkovsky: We need to fundamentally change our foreign policy, which means fundamentally changing our energy policy among others.
[20:17:40] <indigo> Hehe
[20:17:43] <dminkovsky> manicennui: literally the only good thing bush did was the do not call registry; which was never enforced
[20:17:43] <manicennui> Then most of these other problems go away.
[20:17:44] <indigo> What book are you reading
[20:18:13] <dminkovsky> i'm trying to finish up the age of surveillance capitalism so i can write my piece about Time Discipline and Surveillance Capitalism
[20:18:40] <indigo> Neat!!
[20:18:54] <dminkovsky> it's very long for no particularly good reason; but it's good!
[20:19:06] <dminkovsky> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_discipline
[20:19:07] <buttsbot> Time discipline - Wikipedia
[20:19:27] <dminkovsky> there's this: https://www.jstor.org/stable/649749
[20:19:29] <buttsbot> Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism on JSTOR
[20:19:40] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: the reason for that is the democrats don’t have an unofficial propaganda arm that is also one of the most watched primetime cable channels
[20:19:44] <dminkovsky> i'd like to explore how this has progressed in the world of surveillance capitalism
[20:19:51] <ngoldbaum> (bush getting blamed for things)
[20:20:22] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: A lot of Democrats also buy into the whole War on Terror nonsense and the fantasy that our military is sometimes used to ensure our freedumb.
[20:20:27] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Oh.
[20:21:05] <dminkovsky> "It is commonplace that the years between 1300 and 1650 saw within the intellectual culture of Western Europe important changes in the apprehension of time"
[20:21:11] <manicennui> Yeah. I think people also focus on the current nonsense, like trying to play armchair Commander in Chief about what we should have done in Afghanistan at the end.
[20:21:23] <dminkovsky> i feel like survillance capitalism has dramatically changed our apprehension of time
[20:21:43] <dminkovsky> and is a substantial factor (but not only factor) in our present day mass time-poverty
[20:22:29] <dminkovsky> anyone else reading anything
[20:22:51] <manicennui> The best thing that Trump might have done is end the Bush dynasty.
[20:22:56] <manicennui> Although who knows.
[20:23:05] <manicennui> Maybe in a decade one of the younger Bushes will run again.
[20:23:20] <dminkovsky> trump literally did nothing good
[20:23:39] <manicennui> He did a few good things on accident.
[20:23:40] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: I read Zuboff's book a little while ago.  I'm currently re-reading the Hanson/Sussman book
[20:23:45] <dminkovsky> the bush dynasty ended itself cause jeb is milktoast
[20:24:25] <manicennui> One shouldn't have to be boisterous to win the presidency.
[20:24:29] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: so you've already read it once and are now re-reading it
[20:24:34] <dminkovsky> manicennui: well that's all over
[20:25:01] <dminkovsky> i guess abbott is wheelchair bound and could win the presidency
[20:25:16] <dminkovsky> everoyne always said FDR wouldn't e possible in our time but here, look, abbott
[20:25:35] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: yeah.  I thought it was a bad book when I first read it, and I wrote a review I never published.  I'm reading it again to see if I still think it's not good.
[20:25:38] <dminkovsky> anyway, abbott is boisterous
[20:25:55] <dminkovsky> you got an RSS?
[20:26:03] <gwozniak> The answer is, yes, I still don't think it's a good book.  In fact, it's worse than I originally thought
[20:26:04] <manicennui> And an asshole, which is the key to the Republican party.
[20:26:35] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: found it https://wozniak.ca/blog/atom.xml
[20:26:36] <buttsbot> Curried lambda
[20:26:50] <manicennui> The more people you fuck, the more Republicans love you. Even if they are fucking a lot of Republicans pretty hard too.
[20:26:55] <gwozniak> Yeah.  I'm hoping to publish something once Christmas is over
[20:27:48] <gwozniak> manicennui: there is something about being a grade-A shitbag that makes you a big force in the Republican party
[20:27:52] <manicennui> Stupid Democrats only help corporations fuck us.
[20:28:12] <gwozniak> They really are dropping the ball
[20:28:54] <dminkovsky> the scariest person in the world for me is desantis
[20:29:06] <manicennui> Why can't these tech billionaires find the cure for aging so we can keep Bernie alive forever?
[20:29:38] <gwozniak> They only want to keep themselver alive, since they see themselves as humanity's saviours
[20:29:43] <dminkovsky> ugh bernie
[20:29:53] <dminkovsky> he should have moved to the USSR and stayed there
[20:30:30] <dminkovsky> bernie and steven seagal
[20:30:57] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Because he actually gives a shit about people?
[20:31:02] <dminkovsky> and lee harvey oswold
[20:31:10] <dminkovsky> my vibe from bernie is that he gets off on being a good guy
[20:31:17] <dminkovsky> often time that's led to good things for people
[20:31:46] <dminkovsky> there's definitely something more decent about him than other poeple; but something is off about him to me
[20:32:01] <manicennui> I think perhaps you are too cynical.
[20:32:06] <dminkovsky> maybe
[20:32:13] <manicennui> You can watch stuff about him back to the 60s.
[20:32:16] <manicennui> He is the real deal.
[20:32:18] <manicennui> One of the few.
[20:32:42] <dminkovsky> well yeah; it's crazy the guy got accused of being racist, for example; in 1968 he was beint carted off to jail on 57th st
[20:33:15] <dminkovsky> but what about the time he went to the soviet union and said it was good

[20:36:06] <manicennui> There are some good videos out there of his time as mayor of Burlington.
[20:36:26] <companion_cube> I expect it to be interesting but depressing
[20:36:35] <dminkovsky> yeh i watched those, if you're referring to the ones from the 80s with the school children
[20:36:41] <companion_cube> if you haven't read "bad blood" it's also quite interesting
[20:36:44] <dminkovsky> they're hilarious/awesome; bernie is awesome in many ways

[21:34:58] <manicennui> Multiple coworkers have had covid recently.
[21:37:49] <indigo> I got emailed about a positive contact at work recently; thankfully I am still testing negative
[21:37:55] <indigo> More lockdown???
[21:40:33] <indigo> US cases definitely not looking good
[21:42:39] <dminkovsky> called our pediatrician today to see what he thought about our vaxxed/boosted friends from new york coming; he approved it :S
[21:42:50] <dminkovsky> said he's more concerned about old people

[22:13:22] <indigo> Eh, trying to motivate myself to crank out some docs
[22:13:56] <indigo> One of my goals this quarter was to write a design doc for this project, but it has a half baked requirements document
[22:14:47] <imode> seems like the norm these days. :\
[22:14:47] <indigo> Also no one is responding to my chats today so I'm assuming everyone is checked out already
[22:14:59] <imode> oh 100%, I'm one of those people.
[22:15:07] <imode> absolutely fuckin' checked out.

[22:18:33] <imode> I brushed that turd off with a game of vintage story last night.
[22:18:40] <imode> we're up to smithing copper now.
[22:18:52] <imode> and baking bread and pies.
[22:21:44] <imode> imo it was a better time sink than whatever you'd call that.
[22:21:48] <imode> it's like, objectively bad.
[22:22:15] <imode> indigo: as someone working on a skunkworks project this hurts.
[22:22:32] <imode> the future is unclear but worth it.

[22:24:12] <manicennui> I'm pretty much healthy now.
[22:24:27] <Brekkjern> Almost a marathon that
[22:24:49] <dminkovsky> love the internet https://github.com/chbrown/overdrive
[22:24:50] <buttsbot> GitHub - chbrown/overdrive: Bash script to download mp3s from the OverDrive audiobook service
[22:26:13] <epilys> I downloaded a "loaned" book from archive.org with a python script
[22:26:20] <epilys> surprisingly easy to do
[22:26:24] <indigo> imode: I try not to think about whether a project is "worth it" or not
[22:26:39] <epilys> pitch it indigo
[22:26:48] <indigo> Since you can't really tell anyway until it's done :-)
[22:27:01] <imode> in my case, it's worth it.
[22:27:36] <imode> I know what the results will be, I have a 5-year plan to proliferate this tool's usage throughout the org.
[22:27:44] <imode> and it'll effectively automate me out of a job.
[22:32:28] <manicennui> You plan to be there for 5 more years?
[22:32:55] <manicennui> I tend to stay at companies for a long time, but it hasn't served me well.
[22:33:27] <imode> can be handed off if I leave.
[22:33:41] <imode> after that, I don't care.
[22:33:50] <imode> it's just nice to not have uncertainty.
[22:33:56] <manicennui> I think my current job could be pretty perfect if I didn't have to deal with other people.
[22:34:13] <manicennui> Just carve out some part of the software to manage myself as a separate service.
[22:34:27] <imode> thaaaaat's what I'm doin'.
[22:34:58] <manicennui> I recently received permission to be remote full time, and I've been asking around about which states I might be able to move to.
[22:35:07] <manicennui> My boss told me that she doesn't think there is any state that they would actually deny.
[22:35:25] <manicennui> And MA seems like it could be a good option that they are more likely to support.
[22:35:41] <imode> get that cabin in the woods, man.
[22:35:46] <manicennui> I imagine the concern has to be something about insurance or something.
[22:36:01] <manicennui> imode: Or at least a cottage with some land.
[22:36:07] <manicennui> Western MA looks nice.
[22:36:23] <manicennui> Learned recently that we have a group of people in ME.
[22:36:31] <manicennui> One guy lives way up north near the border.
[22:36:52] <imode> ooo.
[22:36:56] <imode> in here or at work.
[22:37:00] <manicennui> At work.
[22:37:24] <manicennui> I know we have people in CO, UT, IL, NY, OH, and ME.
[22:37:30] <manicennui> Oh, and TX.
[22:37:31] <imode> past aroostook, I take it.
[22:38:07] <imode> or at least at the northern peak of aroostook if you're on the border.
[22:38:32] <imode> piscataquis and aroostook are basically no-man's-land.

[22:39:04] <manicennui> I forget which city it was exactly, but he said it was not far from the northern border.
[22:39:17] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Nice.
[22:39:25] <manicennui> I saw something similar to that recently.
[22:39:29] <manicennui> Oh, I think it was somewhere here.
[22:39:33] <manicennui> NFT Olive Garden
[22:39:33] <imode> I was friends with a member of the C++ standards committee that lives up in greenbush.
[22:39:41] <imode> nice guy. had it made.

[23:45:43] <manicennui> Took me a moment to realize what was wrong.
[23:47:00] <imode> that hurts.
[23:47:22] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/o5i8qfp94c781.png
[23:47:49] <imode> eh. I've seen worse.
[23:47:56] <Brekkjern> Well, yes...
[23:48:15] <ngoldbaum> it’s a commentary on the futility of truth-seeking in a postmodern context
[23:48:21] <Brekkjern> Btw. What is that Rust one and the crab from that tweet?
[23:48:38] <imode> "while you're not wrong"
[23:48:40] <Brekkjern> I know I've seen them before, but I can't remember what they are from...
[23:48:41] <ngoldbaum> the crab is the go gopher
[23:48:46] <imode> go go gadget gopher
[23:48:48] <Brekkjern> Ah, of course
[23:49:40] <manicennui> Rust is the nodejs logo, no?
[23:49:47] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:49:57] <Brekkjern> Quick google confirms :P
[23:50:09] <Brekkjern> Difficult to google when you don't know what to google to check it :P
[23:50:21] <imode> remember when projects didn't need logos.
[23:50:47] <manicennui> No.
[23:50:49] <Brekkjern> Not really...
[23:51:00] <imode> shame.
[23:51:04] <manicennui> FreeBSD and OpenBSD have great logos/mascots.
[23:51:10] <manicennui> And have for a long time.
[23:51:27] <manicennui> OpenBSD also had release songs.
[23:51:41] <manicennui> I miss getting releases on CD.
[23:51:42] <imode> it was a quirk, now it's a norm.
[23:52:12] <manicennui> Was it though? Most languages didn't really have a single org behind them.
[23:52:24] <manicennui> Other than the standards body.
[23:52:43] <ngoldbaum> was perl always camels?
[23:52:54] <ngoldbaum> or was that just the oreilly book
[23:52:56] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: I think that association formed because of the book, which is pretty old.
[23:53:08] <manicennui> Sometimes people use an onion for Perl.
[23:53:27] <manicennui> The postgresql elephant is pretty old too.
[23:53:41] <manicennui> Does PHP have a logo?
[23:53:57] <manicennui> I guess it has that stylized way of writing php with the purple background.
[23:56:16] <manicennui> Python's snake logo is pretty old.
[23:56:36] <manicennui> JS's logo is terrible like the language.
[23:58:31] <indigo> I like the logo for LISP
[23:59:04] <indigo> The weird alien one
[23:59:35] <manicennui> I think Clojure has the best version of the lisp logo.
[23:59:55] <indigo> Yeah, it's neat!
