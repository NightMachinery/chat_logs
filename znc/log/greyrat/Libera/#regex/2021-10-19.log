[13:16:41] <digitok> if you mean by matching alone, no

[13:59:08] <re101-bichon-57> example: test12test34test56test76test89 will be match because number of digits is in range 1-10 anything outside will should be evaluated as fasly
[13:59:45] <re101-bichon-57> to match 1 digit [0-9] should be okay
[14:02:01] <re101-bichon-57> curretly im using this regex: ^[0-9]{1,10}$ but if i enter any characters in between numbers e.g: 12A34, its evaluating as not match but in fact the whole string has 4 digits
[14:02:22] <koollman> ([0-9].*){1,10}

[16:20:42] <digitok> is that an oxymoron
[16:21:30] <Me-me> I don't think so. If I tell you that instead of extra-draw, you have rummage, and if you can't rummage, then mill, that's significantly easier to read than what is actually printed on Chains of Mephistopheles, but it's told you less about it, despite being technically accurate.

[16:22:16] <digitok> and you say you don't want to overcomplicate
[16:22:57] <Me-me> Well it's told you less because despite being easier to read, and despite technically having all the information, it's given you a bunch of extra concepts to learn that make it more complicated if you don't already know those concepts.

[20:19:42] <maroon> does class="[^"]+" do what you want?
[20:21:07] <IVE> That exactly what i wanted, thx ! but still don't understand what my regular expression was not working
[20:22:00] <maroon> the dot matched every character including the "
[20:22:59] <IVE> Ohhh true, didn't realise that
[20:23:12] <maroon> you can also try to make it un-greedy like class="(.*?)"
[20:23:12] <IVE> Sweet, thanks i appreciate it !
[20:24:03] <maroon> but the 1st method has many fewer steps
[20:25:50] <IVE> I already started adding the first one into my project, have a great day :)
[20:37:05] <maroon> im trying to have an optional suffix of word1 be in a separate group, but grp2 keeps being greedy and grabbing it https://regex101.com/r/sRfXLo/2/

[20:46:24] <digitok> do you prefer an empty group as opposed to a non-participating one
[20:47:08] <maroon> i prefer a null group rather than no grp2 at all
[20:47:42] <maroon> though i've not tested to see if c# handles a skipped group differently than a null grup

[20:51:24] <arash> Hello, how can i match anything between those two html tags? https://regex101.com/r/3Fzu2H/1 why (.\s)* is not working?
[20:53:26] <maroon> the dot doesnt include line ending, so use [.\n] instead of .
[20:54:01] <maroon> https://regex101.com/r/3Fzu2H/2
[21:06:00] <arash> maroon, your regex didn't solve the problem. look at this one please https://regex101.com/r/LCRBl8/1 i want a regex to strip html tags, group match should contain anything between two html tags
[21:10:17] <maroon> ah, i was just making the minimal change to your pattern, saw a match, and ran with it :)
[21:11:12] <Blondie101010> arash:  that logic can't work as tags can be placed inside other tags
[21:12:32] <arash> Blondie101010, how do you solve this? https://regex101.com/quiz/8
[21:12:32] <Blondie101010> you will not be able to parse HTML properly with regex...  there will always be another case you just didn't try or think about
[21:12:59] * VectorX facepalm
[21:13:07] <arash> Blondie101010, its not about parsing. i'm solving this https://regex101.com/quiz/8
[21:13:47] <maroon> ah so this is a homework question? :)
[21:14:15] <Blondie101010> kinda
[21:14:36] <Blondie101010> now I'll need to do 7 other regex to see the quiz :S
[21:15:08] <arash> Strip all HTML tags from a string. HTML tags are enclosed in < and >. The regex will be applied on a line-by-line basis, meaning partial tags will need to be handled by the regex. Don't worry about opening or closing tags; we just want to get rid of them all. Note: This task is meant to be a learning exercise, and not necessarily the best way to parse HTML.
