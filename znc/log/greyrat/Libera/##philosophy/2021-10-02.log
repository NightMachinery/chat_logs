[07:17:12] <tinwhiskers> amigojapan: I came across a new paper showing the risk of severe covid is quite a bit higher for people on low carb, high protein diets, including keto.
[07:18:08] <amigojapan> tinwhiskers: really...
[07:18:19] <tinwhiskers> https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/4/1/257#DC1

[07:18:27] <biys> tinwhiskers: what i think is interesting about a lot of this is... it really shows the need to have databases
[07:18:39] <biys> that everyone is contributing to
[07:19:00] <amigojapan> tinwhiskers: at least I got my two shots
[07:19:06] <biys> what we need is peopel to buy into an idea of gathering data
[07:19:08] <tinwhiskers> good on ya
[07:19:15] <biys> and we need ways to gather that data reasonably
[07:19:25] <biys> and the system has to be resilient enough to not be subject to bad actors
[07:19:47] <biys> but imagine if we could get large portions of the population involved in having the way theri body functions tracked
[07:19:57] <biys> imagine how much more real information we'd gather into the human body
[07:20:45] <tinwhiskers> They report a 48% higher risk in that group of having severe covid. So to put that in perspective. If the current risk of getting severe covid is 2% then if you're on keto the risk is more like 3%.

[07:23:12] <amigojapan> tinwhiskers: in my wife's case, her diabetes got way better after the keto diet and diabetes is also a factor, she does not even need to inject insulin anymore
[07:23:42] <tinwhiskers> ah, yeah, that certainly complicates things. I would think keto would be likely to be a net benefit in that case, but who knows.
[07:23:58] <amigojapan> Yeah

[07:27:12] <tinwhiskers> biys: completely agree
[07:28:12] <biys> so what we need to develop is...
[07:28:20] <biys> a low cost, easy to use biometrics gathering device
[07:28:38] <biys> and convince peopel to opt into the service for free to better their lives and the quality of the lives of everyone
[07:28:48] <biys> then we make a big database
[07:29:53] <biys> and with the data gathered we attempt to raise everyoens quality of life by having a kind of digital life coach telling you what to do
[07:30:02] <biys> with regards to health anyways
[07:30:18] <biys> there's a lot to be said about psychological attachment to physical health though

[07:38:30] <tinwhiskers> yeah. privacy is always an issue but that would be nice.
[07:39:15] <tinwhiskers> worries like insurance companies linking data and adjusting premiums according to risk, etc.
[07:39:40] <tinwhiskers> hard to make it bulletproof, but I'd probably sign up
[07:42:33] <biys> idk what the deal is with privacy surroudning health
[07:42:39] <biys> i mean... for a leader of a nation maybe
[07:42:52] <tinwhiskers> I'd think for everyone *but* the leader
[07:42:57] <biys> make an option to opt into public display
[07:43:01] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[07:43:25] <biys> i guess if you had somethign to hide about your health?
[07:43:30] <biys> what's the purpose of hiding your health though?
[07:43:32] <tinwhiskers> identifies are usually obscured but people are very good at deanonimising data
[07:43:49] <biys> can you give me an example?
[07:43:57] <tinwhiskers> well insurance company premiums are one
[07:44:20] <biys> i live where there's a single payer healthcare system
[07:44:24] <biys> so...
[07:45:04] <biys> public health services/health care
[07:45:07] <biys> whatever you wanna call them
[07:45:16] <tinwhiskers> but you still have private health insurance as well?
[07:45:31] <tinwhiskers> or maybe not you, but it's also common there?
[07:46:00] <biys> some provinces allow for you to pay for private services.  like a vasectomy, you can go to a private service
[07:46:01] <tinwhiskers> We also have a single payer system in name but there's some things you need to cover with insurance.
[07:46:16] <biys> medicine you pay for depending on the medicine
[07:46:22] <biys> pharmacare
[07:46:28] <tinwhiskers> Aus?

[07:47:28] <biys> only thing i know about NZ is Rubgy and ??Mauri?? is the name of the NZ aboriginals?
[07:47:50] <tinwhiskers> amigojapan: that seems like a reasonable approach... maybe. How does it work out?
[07:47:59] <tinwhiskers> Maori
[07:48:03] <biys> what are the waits liek for services?
[07:48:50] <biys> so here's my problem.  i don't think things will ever go back to the way they once were
[07:48:55] <biys> pre covid
[07:49:00] <tinwhiskers> yeah, so I need hernia surgery now. It's unlikely they'll do it on the public system but if I manage to pull that off with a good lie then it'll take 6 months to a year and a half to be seen.
[07:49:17] <biys> and peopel now, some anyways, want a service to "make sure" they're "safe"
[07:49:20] <biys> whatever that might mean
[07:49:28] <biys> i'm not trying to make fun of it either
[07:49:29] <amigojapan> tinwhiskers: first of all, the government controls price of medical things, so they are cheaper than in America to begin with. Then you go to any hospital you want. And only 30 percent of the bill will be charged to you
[07:49:32] <biys> it's a completely reasonable concern
[07:49:39] <tinwhiskers> yeah, public emergency services are great at least.
[07:49:59] <tinwhiskers> amigojapan: sounds good
[07:50:29] <biys> imagine if off your DB someone then made an app that told you what to buy and you could put in an app like flipp (sales fliers) and have it shop from only the for-sale sections

[11:27:43] <Rashad> Because that is not constructive and doesn't mean anything.
[11:27:55] <Rashad> I would like to focus on her politics instead.
[11:28:09] <iridium__> Rashad: it is quite constructive.
[11:28:28] <Rashad> Are you a nihilist?
[11:28:29] <iridium__> Rashad: if that's the only way women can rise the ladder of politics, damn the feminists have failed.
[11:29:31] <mannequin> who is the moderator for the facebook debian group?
[11:29:43] <Rashad> Why mannequin?
[11:29:46] <mannequin> ooops, wrong channel
[11:29:50] <iridium__> Rashad: i think it's true. it may not be in this particular case, but it's quite stupid to claim any women are there on account of their acumen for politics. not that they don't have any, i suppose.
[11:30:27] <Rashad> iridium__ Margret Thatcher was asked if she's proud to be the first female PM. She said she's more proud that she's the first PM with a degree in science.
[11:30:33] <Rashad> She did chemistry.
[11:30:50] <iridium__> the point being?
[11:31:46] <Rashad> That Margret Thatcher at least herself believed she was worth the job regardless of her sex.
[11:32:14] <mannequin> some people celebrated on the streets when she died
[11:32:37] <mannequin> champaign and stuff like that
[11:32:45] <Rashad> So it happened and it can happen and it should happen, but Biden now ruined the first female VP by not making clear whether Kamala was the best person for the office indeed or she got favored treatment.
[11:32:58] <Rashad> mannequin Doesn't prove any point.
[11:33:07] <Rashad> Although they are welcome to celebrate.
[11:33:14] <aleph0> Rashad: how could he have made it clearer in your view?
[11:33:28] <iridium__> Rashad: so you think Margaret Thatcher was the most important female politician of the last century?
[11:33:44] <mannequin> yeah, just an interesting fact to know, random but still
[11:33:53] <Rashad> aleph0 Not mention sex or race in anyway, or do the opposite by saying "This is the best person for the job and not because she's a woman or of color".
[11:34:08] <Rashad> iridium__ I don't know. Not an expert.
[11:34:23] <iridium__> Rashad: i think you do consider yourself an expert.
[11:34:41] <iridium__> Rashad: and i think you're a fan or Margaret Thatcher and secretly jerk off to her at night.
[11:34:48] <iridium__> s/or/of/
[11:34:48] <ro-bot-o> iridium__ meant to say: Rashad: and i think you're a fan of Margaret Thatcher and secretly jerk off to her at night.
[11:34:51] <Rashad> On the performance of Margret Thatcher and all other female politicians in the last century?
[11:34:58] <Rashad> I have to do a lot of work to decide that.
[11:35:18] <Rashad> I was born in 1992 so I don't even have some of the material needed in memory.
[11:35:44] <Rashad> iridium__ I told you I'm not into insults and ad hominem attacks.
[11:36:04] <iridium__> Rashad: yes you are.
[11:36:28] <Rashad> Yeah I reallly like being insulted.
[11:36:33] <Rashad> It just makes me so happy.
[11:36:43] <iridium__> Rashad: keep it up.
[11:37:35] <Rashad> One would expect every other channel on here to have ad hominem attacks before this one.
[11:37:42] <Rashad> I have no idea how you are not banned yet.
[11:37:50] <iridium__> Rashad: and i you.
[11:38:37] <Rashad> In the channel rules: 2) Avoid ad-hominem/personal attacks. Criticise the ideas and arguments where possible, not the individual expressing them.
[11:38:40] <Rashad> https://pastebin.com/raw/a8FVrqQL
[11:39:11] <iridium__> i choose to flout those rules whenever i can, little man.
[11:39:58] <aleph0> Rashad: maybe having a vice president of a group that is historically underrepresented could be significant, though
[11:40:46] <Rashad> aleph0 You want politicians that represent your ideas and implement them, not ones that represent your skin color.
[11:41:43] <Rashad> I live in Jordan and people vote tribally. If you have my last name, you get my vote.
[11:42:02] <aleph0> Rashad: racism could mean that your needs align with your skin colour
[11:42:03] <Rashad> This is not what you would expect from the US, but it seems to be a valid way of doing politics now.
[11:42:20] <aleph0> i mean, you do have to look at their policies as well though
[11:42:22] <iridium__> Rashad: oh, you're from Jordan?
[11:43:02] <Rashad> aleph0 Once race/skin-color/sex/last-name become important in logic, philosophy or science, I'll start paying attention to it in politics.
[11:43:16] <Rashad> aleph0 Imagine trying to solve climate change using your skin color instead of your ideas.
[11:43:25] <Rashad> And that applies to any other political issue.

[11:44:51] <aleph0> Rashad: it's not that you use your skin colour to solve problems, it's that being a certain skin colour might mean that you have first-hand experience of injustices

[11:47:07] <aleph0> though skin colour can just be used for tokenism i guess
[11:47:34] <Rashad> aleph0 I prefer to believe that we are one human race with shared struggles and the ability to identify other people's struggles as our own and vice versa.
[11:47:53] <iridium__> Rashad: that's certainly not true.
[11:48:29] <Rashad> While skin color might vary, the "soul" of a human being is the same.
[11:48:37] <iridium__> Rashad: no, it's not.
[11:49:39] <iridium__> Rashad: are you Muslim?
[11:51:45] <Rashad> I remember a time when directors would be criticized for NOT discussing issues of other communities than their own in their movies. It was considered closed minded and unimaginative.
[11:52:59] <aleph0> maybe it is about ideas actually: i suppose the idea is that experience shapes your worldview in which case it might be easier just to look at their worldview rather than their upbringing
[11:53:41] <aleph0> though i suppose your upbringing can affect your biases, which might be harder to see
[11:54:09] <Rashad> OK consider a modern scientist reading an ancient science text. They will use: 1) an antiquated language, 2) completely different experimental tools, 3) have different mathematical systems, notations, etc
[11:54:27] <Rashad> Yet the modern scientist, if they are good enough, will immediately recognize what the ancient scientist was doing.
[11:54:51] <Rashad> "Oh yes! They are talking about imaginary numbers now! Funny they call them such and such"

[12:18:40] <Rashad> If persuasion is possible between human beings, then peace is the normal case. If persuasion is impossible, then war is the normal case. Marx realized that right away and said that only violent revolution could solve the dispute between the classes.
[12:19:42] <mannequin> it was supposed to be good, turned out like _always_
[12:20:24] <mannequin> everything had been said already
[12:20:39] <mannequin> yet we're still fighting
[12:20:40] <Rashad> Consider how we treat other animals. If birds could be reasoned with, then they'd be of so much use to humanity, and they would also be given rights and be able to follow laws and such.
[12:21:25] <Rashad> The reason we kill birds and eat them or for whatever other reason is because we cannot reason with them.
[12:21:34] <mannequin> no
[12:22:00] <mannequin> it is because at one point humans had no option but to kill a bird to feed himself
[12:22:12] <Rashad> The orca has learned language, where every group develops its own language. They are also much smarter than other animals, and have to learn how to hunt, just like humans, instead of relying on their senses to guide them to the prey.
[12:22:18] <mannequin> eating meat is a part of cultural position
[12:22:30] <Rashad> So far nobody has been able to crack an orca language and therefor maybe we could use them as our equals.

[12:23:53] <mannequin> in the animal kingdom, there has to be a major impact to make such switch
[12:24:13] <mannequin> you're an elitist, i despise you
[12:25:46] <Rashad> How am I an elitist?
[12:26:09] <mannequin> "people who are detached from reality are given less rights and less responsibilities"
[12:26:09] <Rashad> I put rational human beings first in the animal kingdom not because they are inherently good but because they are good for me.
[12:26:49] <Rashad> Yes if you hear voices that tell you to kill other people you should be confined and you will not be held responsible in the same way sane people are.
[12:27:25] <mannequin> i cannot stand you and no voice is telling me that
[12:27:41] <aleph0> isn't there a difference between these restrictions, which are designed to stop people from getting hurt, and the way animals are treated
[12:27:42] <mannequin> but maybe i'm just in bad mood
[12:27:51] <aleph0> which very much does hurt them in some cases
[12:28:10] <aleph0> like animal testing for cosmetics, and factory farming
[12:28:15] <Rashad> aleph0 For sure. With human beings, there is always the chance of recovering your rational ability. With animals the case is not there to begin with.
[12:29:31] <Rashad> Also you can have someone like Nash who could recognize his illness to a certain degree and still be rational in other areas of life.
[12:30:34] <aleph0> hm, but even if a someone is very unlikely to recover their rational faculties we would consider it wrong to mistreat or exploi them
[12:30:36] <aleph0> exploit*

[12:31:40] <mannequin> i'll let you think about it
[12:31:44] <Rashad> aleph0 People who care for the memory of such individuals can choose to continue to support them. We already know people with dementia, left to their own devices, are not very likely to survive.
