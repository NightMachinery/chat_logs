[18:15:49] <Bayes> since_ since you've been asking about signal processing lately
[18:15:56] <Bayes> do you have any experience with wavelets?
[18:16:54] <since_> not much
[18:17:11] <since_> But maybe someone else here does :)
[18:17:14] <Bayes> hm
[18:17:45] <Bayes> I have a function that is not periodic and could actually have multiple modes
[18:17:57] <Bayes> fourier series didn't seem like a good fit for that situation
[18:18:32] <Bayes> so I was thinking wavelets? maybe there's something else more appropriate or simpler out there

[23:34:11] <Bayes> I'm just driving an atomic brain fart
[23:34:16] * rickyrick farts
[23:34:40] <Bayes> 'preciate it
[23:36:34] <Bayes> z | y is normal, y is normal... marginal of z sucks
[23:37:34] <rickyrick> wat
[23:37:57] <rickyrick> Is "y is normal" an assumption
[23:38:57] <Bayes> yeah
[23:41:01] <rickyrick> Sooooo
[23:41:13] <rickyrick> Doesn't that mean (z,y) is MVN
[23:42:09] *** Quits: julius (~raffaem@95.74.95.143) (Quit: Leaving)

[23:42:23] <Bayes> all of the above, none of the above
[23:42:30] <Bayes> https://i.imgur.com/Vdm3HP1.png
[23:43:26] <Bayes> z | y is normal, y is normal: the marginal p(z) = int p(z | y) p(y) dy sucks
[23:43:26] <rickyrick> I guess not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:43:29] <Bayes> heh
[23:43:50] <Bayes> it sucks when shit is so easy to code
[23:44:11] <rickyrick> Just STAN/JAGS/BUGS it to death
[23:44:15] <Bayes> monte carlo makes any expression looks trivial
[23:44:17] <Bayes> yeah I know right
[23:44:25] <Bayes> that's where I started
[23:44:34] <Bayes> but I don't know I was hoping one could neat it up a bit
[23:44:54] <Bayes> I was trying to find some kind of joint normal me too
[23:45:16] <Bayes> but no such luck fartyfart
[23:45:23] <rickyrick> Yeah I guess z | y could be a non-trivial function of y
[23:45:37] <rickyrick> z | y ~ N(cos(y), sin(y)^2)
[23:45:38] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[23:46:06] <Bayes> write that and send it out as the problem of the month to the IMS bulletin
[23:46:07] <Bayes> lol
[23:46:52] <rickyrick> ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
[23:48:30] <Bayes> you know what also doesn't help?
[23:49:29] <Bayes> that I'm doing \mathbf{b}^{1/2} \circ \mathbf{X}, where the X are fixed and b ~ MVN
[23:49:47] <Bayes> and \circ is hadamard product, i.e., sweep
[23:50:15] <Bayes> so it's like multiplying each column of X by each column of b, where b is normal
[23:50:23] <Bayes> introducing all kind of spicy things in here xD
[23:57:13] <rickyrick> Maybe just attack the result element-wise then piece it back together
