[05:28:58] <kristijonas> https://pasteboard.co/uJkogirU8eWY.png that's a sent multipart/signed message that got distorted also the signature invalid, i believe possible this happened: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2015#section-3 but not so sure how to fix it. Is it MUA bug or smth can be fixed in sending MTA?
