[00:00:38] <StayHungry> basically, you were not alone who felt it odd. :) there were deviations toward specie as singular and specieses as plural (Lewis Carroll used it for example), but then it was sorted out in the current (odd for non-natives) form.

[00:01:36] <pussipupu> "pea" is a back formation from "peas" which was assumed to be plural because of the s
[00:04:40] <TechTest> who eats only one? :P
[00:05:11] <TechTest> StayHungry: yeah, it can be confusing for non natives
[00:06:30] <StayHungry> i am ok with -s, there is biceps after all. but you have to add articles or other means to clarify species every time and then put animals into singular form after 'of'. e.g. 'we observed _a_ species of bat_ yet not discovered'
[00:07:44] <TechTest> isn't it 'bisep' the singular?
[00:08:15] <pussipupu> no
[00:08:35] <pussipupu> though that's a common enough error that "maybe one day"
[00:09:43] <pussipupu> in "species of X" species and X don't agree in number
[00:09:57] <pussipupu> so no you don't
[00:12:36] <TechTest> do you say "right biceps" and "left biceps"?
[00:14:31] <StayHungry> in my native language we do :)
[00:18:16] <StayHungry> as for species, we say '...observed a rare specie_ of bats_' and '...various species of wildlife in the jungles: monkeys, tigers, etc'. the latter is the same in English, the former just have to be learned by heart :)

[00:26:56] <StayHungry> bat (as well as cat and rat) was among first words i learned. our teacher revealed them with article 'a'. immediately i raised the hand to ask 'what for', 'why do we have to clarify whether that cat is unknown or specific one'. :D

[00:34:55] <StayHungry> imagine this. i'm painting 'some' cat. you pass by the easel, not seeing the picture, and ask: 'whatcha doin, bruh?' if i reply 'a cat', then you might think 'oh, seen lots of them, boring'. if 'the cat', then you might try to get closer to see what is so special about. so there is no obvious way to reply vaguely.
[00:38:17] <StayHungry> contrary to: 'whom are you are thinking about?' -> 'about Maria' (not a Maria, not the Maria) -> 'someone I know?'

[23:01:39] <wstrnr> hello, i have a question about subjunctive mood, if i'm correct. the phrase is: "ash_worksi: i can suggest you to use the script utility."
[23:01:51] <wstrnr> but is "to" in "to use" really needed in this case?
[23:03:11] <wstrnr> i remember there is some rule regarding use of "to" in subjunctive mood statements
[23:03:28] <twb> !WOTD to intimate (vt.) - to convey some information, to tell, to inform
[23:03:29] *** ChanServ changes topic to 'English language help & discussion | Try to spell and capitalise correctly | Use UTF-8 | Provide context! | We reserve the right to kick annoying people | More rules- https://github.com/Freenode-English/topic/wiki | ##english-ops to contact ops (tell us about PM spam immediately, please) | WotD: to intimate (vt.) - to convey some information, to tell, to inform'
[23:04:26] <wstrnr> wow, this topic is overweight
[23:05:07] <wstrnr> what do you think about strunk-and-whiting it a bit?
[23:05:28] <wstrnr> for example: "Try to spell and capitalise correctly" -> "Spell correctly!"
[23:06:00] <blkshp> Denied.
[23:06:23] <wstrnr> "We reserve the right to kick annoying people" -> "We kick annoying people!"
[23:06:33] <blkshp> Denied.
[23:06:41] <blkshp> Because we don't always.
[23:06:52] <blkshp> Just if we do it's justified.
[23:06:54] <blkshp> :D
[23:07:54] <wstrnr> "##english-ops to contact ops (tell about PM spam immediately!)"
[23:08:06] <wstrnr> any way, you get my point
[23:08:16] <blkshp> "tell about" is poor english
[23:08:57] <wstrnr> "report PM spam immediately!"
[23:09:35] <wstrnr> something like that. a native English speaker will have a power to properly formulate that
[23:09:37] <blkshp> I'll think about that one
[23:09:57] <blkshp> But this channel is not specifically for native speakers.
[23:11:09] <wstrnr> any way, any way. i've been asked about subjunctive mood and "to", and i see "Try to spell and ..." in topic
[23:11:56] <wstrnr> so, "to" should always be used in this kind of sentences, right?
[23:12:12] <mdogg> wstrnr: The additional explanation for 'spelling properly' is needed because we really ask people to do their best to use proper spelling.  If it just reads "spell correctly" then there is an implication that a user might be disciplined if they make a spelling mistake.  
[23:12:16] <mdogg> "We kick annoying people." means that it will always happened which isn't the case if the channel OPs are asleep at the time.  
[23:12:45] <blkshp> Or you're the correct kind of annoying!
[23:12:50] <blkshp> happen*
[23:13:22] <wstrnr> all right.
[23:13:43] <mdogg> Correct - happen.   THat's something I need to work on.
[23:14:01] <blkshp> as wstrnr it's difficult to answer the question because the "type of sentence" could mean a lot of things
[23:14:14] <wstrnr> "That's something I need to work on." is another example of a subjunctive mood statement.
[23:14:26] <blkshp> Try to spell correctly / Try spelling correctly. Is a similar but not necessarily the same meaning.
[23:15:06] <mdogg> "Try spelling correctly" could be a request for someone to spell the word "correctly".
[23:15:29] <blkshp> Yes or a sarcastic way to tell someone to do better if they can't spell.
[23:15:50] <blkshp> Or make frequent errors. Say it aloud with a huff at the start!
[23:16:40] <mdogg> This is probably my favorite channel.
[23:16:58] <blkshp> \o/
[23:20:48] <wstrnr> i don't know guys, "Try" still seems like perfect example of a needless word here. i think it was written on the gravestone of Charles Bukowsky, "Don't Try"
[23:21:00] <TechTest> just say "don't use 'u' "
[23:21:20] <TechTest> that's the only intolerable mistake
[23:21:27] <blkshp> never EVER use "u" on its own to mean "you". You will be terminated.
[23:21:33] <TechTest> u

[23:26:23] <mdogg> It isn't just 'u'.  I've seen people use '2' to represent to, two, and too before.  It's sad.
[23:27:23] <blkshp> this is why I have...
[23:27:25] <blkshp> "u"; "r"; "y"; "4" and "2" are not replacements for their 2, 3 or 4 letter word counterparts. Please don't use them here.
[23:29:56] <TechTest> what does "4" stand for?
[23:30:05] <mdogg> What are your thoughts on plugging https://www.lexico.com/ in the topic as a thesaurus/dictionary resource?  That's by far my favorite.

[23:31:50] <TechTest> from where though?
[23:31:54] <mdogg> PM'ing users without prior approval can get you banned.

[23:32:00] <TechTest> you wouldn't
[23:32:05] <blkshp> Try me.
