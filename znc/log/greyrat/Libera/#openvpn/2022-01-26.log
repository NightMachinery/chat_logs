[16:26:00] <Fohsap> when I use openvpn, somehow services like Google.com and Bing.com are able to detect my actual location.  It bothers me because my default language always turns out to be wherever I'm at, and that's one of the biggest reasons for me to use a VPN.  Does anyone know how to change this?
[16:35:18] <plaisthos> probably something else that gives away your location like your browser
[16:36:33] <ordex> or if you ae logged in, google simply knows about you
[16:40:44] <plaisthos> that people location is only identified by IP is something that VPN are telling you :D
[16:41:09] <plaisthos> but they "forget" to mention that there are various other ways to guess a customer's location
[16:41:56] <ordex> Fohsap: try opening google in an anonymous window after connecting to the VPN
[16:42:03] <ordex> that *may* help
[16:43:51] <BtbN> Every modern browser also just has a Geolocation-API built in, that gives a rough estimate of where you are to websites
[16:49:22] * ordex just checked about:config and found geo.*

[17:01:50] <rob0> Another thing I found recently: by default Windows will use automatic proxy settings pushed by your ISP's DHCP server.  Not sure, but probably Mac also.  I'd think a redirecting VPN would bypass that, but I've never had the opportunity to test that.
[17:02:14] <BtbN> Whose Windows-Installation will ever talk directly to some ISP DHCP server?
[17:02:44] <ordex> right - normally you have a router or something in between anyway
[17:03:10] <BtbN> I can't even get a modem anymore. Plain does not exist.
[17:03:16] <BtbN> It's always built into a whole shitty router
[17:04:45] <ordex> BtbN: what country ?
[17:04:52] <BtbN> Whole world
[17:05:09] <BtbN> like, there is no stand alone modern DSL modem in existence. Nowhere.
[17:05:18] <ordex> ah DSL
[17:05:19] <ordex> yeah
[17:05:41] <ordex> I used a tp-link, which comes with some linux flavour buit it was impossible to rebuild it
[17:05:41] <BtbN> The last "kinda dedicated modem" is for the last standard, and it works by... putting a whole router on a PCIe card and exposing it as ethernet device to the PC
[17:05:57] <BtbN> For 35b support, nothing exists
[17:06:05] <ordex> luckily with fiber you can get a simple fiber-to-eth converter and plug in your router there
[17:06:14] <BtbN> Fiber is even worse here
[17:06:18] <ordex> BtbN: yeah, I used the tp-link for that
[17:06:29] <BtbN> every ISP has a proprietary idea of it, so ONLY their cheap shitbox works
[17:06:47] <ordex> talking about fiber?
[17:06:50] <BtbN> Mostly because they decided to cheap out, and turn the fiber into a shared medium
[17:07:04] <ordex> well, the GPON network is pretty standard world wide
[17:07:06] <BtbN> So a lot of customers are on the same fiber, and the modems have to cooperate
[17:07:20] <ordex> BtbN: where did you see that? I am curious
[17:07:29] <BtbN> Telekom Germany does that A LOT
[17:07:55] <BtbN> _only_ their crappy router works with their true FTTH connections. Nothing else.
[17:08:08] <ordex> hm are you sure? in a GPON network normally the user only has a ONT, while on the other side (isp side) they have a OLT/ONU which does the (de)multiplexing. but the user does not see anything of it
[17:08:22] <ordex> I have my ONT doing fiber-to-eth and i just plugged in my openwrt router
[17:08:29] <ordex> it acts as "modem" as it does the pppoe
[17:08:55] <BtbN> They literally only pull a single fiber to a multi-family house here. And have a passive splitter in the basement
[17:08:57] <ordex> if I wish, I could even get a SFP module and plug the fiber directly in my router. it would work as long as the S/N is whitelisted
[17:09:00] <rob0> I'm on fiber, but have not yet splurged for a router good enough to handle it.  Hard to justify spending the money when the ISP's router costs nothing.
[17:09:32] <BtbN> Sometimes they also wire multiple individual houses up with such a passive splitter
[17:09:54] <BtbN> So if the head-station sends something, ALL customer devices see it, and need to determine what's theirs.
[17:10:13] <BtbN> And all customer devices need to athere to their frequency and timeslot when sending, otherwise they collide
[17:10:20] <ordex> BtbN: when you say "ALL customer", do you mean the device in the basement
[17:10:27] <BtbN> No, it's FTTH
[17:10:31] <ordex> ok
[17:10:38] <ordex> so you're saying the device in the basement does not filter?
[17:10:43] <ordex> just replicates to every customer?
[17:10:48] <BtbN> The device in the basement is truely passive. No power needed.
[17:11:50] <ordex> maybe it's just convenience of how things are deployed
[17:11:55] <BtbN> More complex FTTB setups also exist, where there is an active device in the basement, that then distributes to the individual apartment.
[17:11:58] <ordex> http://www.gpon.com/how-gpon-works
[17:12:02] <ordex> this is how it is supposed to work
[17:12:05] <BtbN> But those usually use DSL or Coax to get the last few meters
[17:12:19] <ordex> if you see the last device doing splitting is the ONU
[17:12:51] <ordex> after that, you don't see "everything"
[17:13:14] <BtbN> The most annoying this is: They DO have an SFP module for their stuff. And even use it in the router.
[17:13:17] <BtbN> But it only works in that router
[17:16:39] <plaisthos> ordex: you have per customer encryption to avoid privacy issues
[17:16:47] <plaisthos> But I bet there are ISP that screw that up
[17:17:17] <ordex> plaisthos: it depends on how this is implemented. in Italy there are many ISPs, but just a few fiber providers
[17:17:26] <ordex> the fiber providers handle the physical layer
[17:17:51] <ordex> I guess they respect the standard GPON schema, but at the end they don't have to be compatible with anybody else :D so not sure
[17:18:39] <plaisthos> I can get VDSL with up to 125 MBit/s here!
[17:19:06] <plaisthos> I pay 49 EUR for 100 MBit/s and would 59 EUR for up to 250 MBit/s which ends up to be 125 MBit/s
[17:19:08] <ordex> http://www.gpon.com/gpon-security
[17:19:25] <ordex> well, if those are real numbers, it is still pretty good
[17:19:39] <plaisthos> GPONs recommendation G.984.3 shows mechanisms for security in which an encrypted algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard, can be used so it will be difficult for information to be encrypted by using byte keys 128, 192 and 256. 
[17:19:43] <ordex> here we can now get 1G/300M or 2.5G/1G or 10G/3G
[17:19:47] <plaisthos> can be used
[17:19:57] <plaisthos> privacy is optional!
[17:19:59] <ordex> the devil is in the details !!
[17:29:03] <BtbN> Yeah, I'm quite happy with my 270/45 DSL here as well. Specially given it only costs 25â‚¬ a month
[17:35:57] <rob0> I'm paying US$80 for gigabit, and no charge for CPE, so I am not complaining.  Especially since my only other broadband options are 4G and satellite!
[17:36:54] <rob0> (symmetric!  Some of my team have asked me to run an openvpn for them! ;) )
[17:37:59] <ordex> :D
[17:39:30] <rob0> I think I will, but not AS.  I want to try community with dco.
[17:39:59] <rob0> (maybe use AS for the PKI, because $lazy :) )
[17:40:22] <ordex> rob0: do it !
[17:40:29] <ordex> we need more beta testers ":)
[17:42:08] <mzar> rob0: please don't hesitate to test it, it's a milestone

[22:04:05] <jermy> I'm having an issue with a newly installed server, and I think it might be related to the Debian fix for CVE-2020-15078
[22:05:51] <jermy> It's a server configured with `management-client-auth` and `auth-gen-token` - clients that support an auth-token send this on re-auth, but there doesn't seem to be any reauthing of the connection, or communication with the management socket which means that the other end could re-auth it
[22:07:45] <jermy> The debian patch to fix the CVE looks like it marks the authentication as deferred, and then never authorizes the connection as a result - but doesn't send a management socket request
