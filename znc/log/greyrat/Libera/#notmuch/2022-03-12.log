[21:07:28] *** Quits: haasn (~nand@haasn.dev) (*.net *.split)
[21:07:48] <bremner> ah. Right. That isn't directly queryable.
[21:08:08] <inwit> I'd like to auto-delete old messages automatically, and `date:2010..12months` doesn't really do it.

[21:39:09] <inwit> lagash: Right. I'd like to do that in a way independent of the provider. I guess bash scripting would be a way.
[21:50:35] <bremner> the easy way is to remove old deleted messages, as opposed to messages that were deleted a long time ago
[21:51:09] <bremner> something like fold:trash and data:..2m
[21:51:23] <bremner> err. date: note data:
[21:58:41] <inwit> bremner, thanks, but that's exactly what I'm trying to do. Trying to remove messages that are older than 1 year, for example. However, date:..2m shows me also messages from right now, instead of messages _up to 2 months ago_.
[21:58:50] *** Joins: acdw (~case@user/acdw)
[22:00:57] <bremner> hmm, let me check.
[22:01:39] <bremner> right, m is minutes I guess. Try date:..2months
[22:09:40] <inwit> Yeah! That works indeed for chunks of a month. I was looking for date:..365days, so I can daily delete messages that are roughly one year old. I'll go and code that in my hooks! Thanks!
