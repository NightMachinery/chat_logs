[04:12:03] <y3k> Hello there o/
[04:12:13] <y3k> Don't know if it's the best place to ask or not.
[04:12:50] <y3k> But is there a way to mount a directory from the guest on a host through SSH ONLY when using a connection? something similar to the ssh-agent.
[04:13:18] <y3k> What I want is to have sensitive files (e.g. aws/credentials) on my machine, and only "mount" them into the server when SSHing into it.
[04:13:30] <sheep> sshfs?
[04:13:40] <y3k> Are you asking me?
[04:13:45] <y3k> I don't know, that's why I ask.
[04:13:52] <sheep> have you considered using sshfs?
[04:13:55] <Edu4rdSHL> !give y3k aw sshfs

[04:17:02] <y3k> sshfs seems to allow mount a directory from the server as a local directory, I need it the other way around: when I do `ssh -t myserver tmux` have ~/foo mounted as `myserver:~/foo`
[04:17:30] <sheep> you would run an ssh server on the client then have the server connect back with sshfs
[04:18:27] <y3k> I was hoping not to do so, the client is laptop so I can't guarantee ports opened / forwarded :(

[04:21:26] <SponiX> rawktucc: thanks for your input
[04:21:34] <rawktucc> :)
[04:21:37] <rawktucc> Also don'
[04:21:54] <rawktucc> Also don't get me wrong, GNOME is good, it works. It's why I use ubuntu at work, because it just works and it looks fancy
[04:21:57] <rawktucc> but it's bloated, and I hate snaps
[04:22:48] <mcoffin> y3k: you could use ssh tunneling to "forward" the ports, then connect that way. It's admittedly kinda janky, but if you're stuck with the ssh-only solution, that might be an option
[04:23:17] <mcoffin> so, sshd on laptop, use ssh tunneling to forward traffic back, then ssh+sshfs\
[04:23:31] <mcoffin> at least that's what I'd look in to next if I were attacking it that wya
[04:23:56] <y3k> mcoffin: not stuck with SSH thankfully, I use it to get into the servers but I wouldn't mind a different approach for the FS issue.
[04:24:13] *** Joins: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[04:24:29] <mcoffin> y3k: You could also just rsync/scp the ~/.aws dir to the remote server, then look for a way to auto-remove it on disconnect
[04:25:03] <y3k> I mean, "ideally" I'd like to have it "automated" as for example the ssh-agent that "exposes" the private key without actually sharing the file; would love something alike with files.
[04:25:39] <mcoffin> y3k: I mean if the info is accessible on the remote machine, then anything root on that remote is gonna have access
[04:25:45] <mcoffin> end of story on that one
[04:25:56] <mcoffin> no matter how it's exposed
[04:26:04] <y3k> mcoffin: that was my first idea, but wanted to explore options first. Is there a way to ensure the auto-remove thing gets called on disconnect (I use tmux)?
[04:26:18] <SponiX> rawktucc: well, I was debating doing gnome 40 on Arch. Not Ubuntu + snaps :)
[04:26:39] <y3k> Well, I'm the only one that uses those remote machines, just don't feel "good" by leaving sensible files in there, would love to have them only while working on it.
[04:26:44] <y3k> *with them
[04:26:49] <SponiX> rawktucc: Honestly no need now though, I have my Plank Launcher setup and am content
[04:26:55] <rawktucc> :) woo hoo!
[04:27:29] <mcoffin> y3k: well, depending on your remote server, the way I would personally do it, is set up a mdcrypt partition on the remote with the creds, then make it start on startup for the systemd user daemon for my user, but that depends on how the re3mote sshd is setup and whatnot, and implies you have full control over the remote machine, so probably doesn't apply
[04:27:34] <mcoffin> but that's how I'd go about it
[04:28:00] <y3k> I do have full control of the remote server.
[04:28:06] <y3k> I'll investigate about mdcrypt then.
[04:28:07] <y3k> Thank you.
[04:28:50] <mcoffin> well then the best way I'd say is yea just keep your ~/.aws on an encrypted partition, and mount the encrypted partition on startup for the systemd user daemon, and  unmount and stop (doable with systemd mount units)
[04:29:06] <mcoffin> but obviously there are 1000 ways to do this
[04:29:25] <mcoffin> unfortunately, unless you build it, none of them are "forward local dir with ssh client"
[04:29:33] <y3k> Understood.
[04:29:37] * mcoffin clarifies: afaik
[04:29:40] <y3k> Thank you for the advice.
[04:29:46] <mcoffin> np. good luck
[04:29:50] <y3k> I think you're right, been googling for a while and can't find anything.

[06:42:48] <jaawerth> hrm so I just had a power loss mid-pacman-Syu, I did the arch-root, pacman -Syu'd, etc to recover archiso, but after reboot  NetworkManager was dead; I ended up backing up and deleting all the "file exists" error paths to get pacman -U working for it, which worked, but... now I have doubts about the state of other systems. anything else I might want to run to, like, double-check? running a big
[06:42:50] <jaawerth> `paccheck` now, just in case
[06:45:24] <kevr> scary
[06:46:51] <jaawerth> yeah... this coputer is on its last legs. it can't recognize the power adapter anymore so it's always a sneeze away from death

[17:11:55] <btrfs> I was skimming through the wiki. Anyone know what I have to do to get a btrfs installation as "/"? Is it basically the same as the ext4 installation, except that we do "mkfs.btrfs" instead of "mkfs.ext4", and then pacstrap the extra "btrfs-progs"? Or, are there other changes that we need to modify, i.e., concerning grub?

[17:13:14] <btrfs> I believe that grub-btrfs isn't necessary, since its purpose is to "include snapshots into grub menu"

[17:15:06] <btrfs> Foxboron: I'm looking at the "File systems" page now. It seems that I only need btrfs-progs. I guess I'll just try with that, see how it goes :)
[17:15:17] <btrfs> And I'll pay more attention, i.e., by re-reading the grub page
[17:15:21] <demonicmaniac> that's all you need yes - unless you want to do subvolumes and such
[17:15:30] <Foxboron> You should add a subvolume to /, yes
[17:15:43] <demonicmaniac> also you might want do adjust the mount options

[17:16:50] <btrfs> I think I'm comfortable adjusting mount options in fstab and stuff, but I'm not sure why I need a subvolume---This is a small computer, I'm just planning to have a big volume as "/". Are there complications for a tmpfs or something, causing me "having" to use a subvolume?
[17:17:15] <btrfs> I recall that tmpfs stuff is dealt in the RAM, so I don't think it's particularly related with btrfs

[17:19:59] <btrfs> Well, I'm actually ranting in my head that "Linux doesn't really have drivers and most things work out of the box", since that means a lot of kernel modules for stuff that I never use...

[17:25:18] <demonicmaniac> zstd still isn't the default though if you specify just compression but yes 3 is default. i guess 1/2/3/4/5/6 really just depends on your cpu speed and your disk space
[17:26:06] <demonicmaniac> for funsies i tried zstd:9 once
[17:26:08] <Foxboron> demonicmaniac: I meant :3 is the default for zstd. no compression is still default :p
[17:26:26] <demonicmaniac> and 15 once
[17:26:28] <Foxboron> :1 is still better then lzo, and *way* faster. At :3 you start sacrificing io more
[17:26:34] <demonicmaniac> zstd:15 actually caused fun stuff to happen

[20:12:11] <SysGhost> I just tested usb redirect, and it works as intended. No problems. Before assuming it's the redirection that are at fault, make sure the very same USB device(s) and port(s) are functioning properly on the host itself. Rule out actual hardware problems.
[20:12:43] <zbe> Yeah they work. tested with multiple sticks, usb3/2 ports...
[20:13:34] <SysGhost> There are however some really old USB 1.x devices that doesn't work nicely at all when redirected. They usually require some very VERY precise signal timing that doesn't work when redirected.
