[00:43:09] <hbag> bookworm: i installed an extension that re-enables the ability to install PWAs on firefox
[00:43:10] <hbag> works pretty good
[00:43:21] <bookworm> which one?
[00:43:30] <hbag> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/
[00:56:03] <xnaas> https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox it's more than one piece
[00:56:17] <xnaas> and it is not without issues and annoyances
[00:58:26] <hbag> probably
[00:58:29] <hbag> does what i need tho

[01:14:28] <kinghat> sad they wont budge on pwas on desktop
[01:14:54] <kinghat> or allowing access to store extensions on mobile. my last two gripes with firefox tbh.
[01:19:15] <xnaas> the mobile one is "resolved" by using nightly
[01:19:16] <xnaas> but like
[01:19:20] <xnaas> you shouldn't have to lol
[01:33:56] <Activ8> Why on earth wonâ€™t they leave PWAs in FF itâ€™s one of the best things to happen to a browser
[01:34:00] <Activ8> are they mad
[01:36:47] <kinghat> its coming to stable or they only keep it there for devs?
[01:37:14] <kinghat> xnaas ^
[01:37:17] <hbag> i mean a post saying that its in nightly was from like 2020
[01:37:18] <hbag> so
[01:40:07] <xnaas> I'm not sure, kinghat, sorry. But like hbag said, it's been that way for awhile, so... ðŸ™ƒ
[01:45:07] <xnaas> Activ8: desktop Firefox never had PWAs. They had code for their own, incomplete implementation called SSB (site-specific browser, iirc) but they nuked the code then said "fuck you guy, you don't need PWAs plus no one uses them"
[01:45:11] <xnaas> meanwhile supporting PWAs on mobile...
[01:45:13] <xnaas> ðŸ™„
[01:45:19] <xnaas> fuckin' hate Mozilla
[01:56:46] <Activ8> One reason to move to another browser
[02:00:21] <hbag> if i ask "like what" and you say "chrome" i will laugh in your face
[02:00:49] <Activ8> Even better 
[02:00:55] <Activ8> edge chromium
[02:01:11] <Activ8> ðŸ˜‚ guess what it has PWAs and it works
