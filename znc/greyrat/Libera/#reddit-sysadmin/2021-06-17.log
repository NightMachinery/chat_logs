[02:19:25] <Hobadee> People here with o365 - you guys get it direct, or you use a reseller?
[02:20:28] <Hunterkll> direct
[02:20:30] <Hunterkll> both small and large
[02:20:41] <Hunterkll> reseller benefit is they handle more support for you, downside is you can't open cases with MS directly
[02:20:43] <Hunterkll> the CSP has to do it
[02:20:58] <Hunterkll> direct means ur all on your own, but you can open support cases yourself
[02:21:06] <Hunterkll> i wouldn't do a reseller unless like, they're also your MSP etc

[02:22:48] <Hobadee> Different from Google then.  We have a reseller for Google, but we can still open tickets direct
[02:23:44] <Hunterkll> yea, MS's idea here is that the CSP will be able to resolve/solve your issue first
[02:23:48] <Hunterkll> so that they do n't burn support labor on it
[02:23:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:24:05] <Hunterkll> but also that the CSP is supposed to help set you up, support you, plan deployment, etc
[02:24:47] <Hobadee> Do they?  lol.  Probably a mixed bag there

[09:06:07] <e1> i actually didnt know that was a thing
[09:06:09] <e1> one sec
[09:07:26] <e1> also - firewall?
[09:09:38] <e1> are you trying to do this without previously configuring anything additional?
[09:09:41] <e1> https://www.georgiasoftworks.com/ssh-server-windows/faq/how-to-enable-ssh-scp
[09:09:45] <e1> There's some prep work involved apparently
[09:10:09] <e1> I tested it here and it's trying to connect via port 22 so it's not going to work without a daemon listening on that port on the windows side...
[09:11:47] <xe0n> lol unless there is a service of some sort listening for incoming requests on port 22 and can accept scp, nothing is going to happen. that's like trying to connect via ftp\whatever to a host and its not listening waiting for incoming requests, it will just fail
[09:13:05] <e1> I got extremely excited for a moment that there was a built in way to transfer linux -> windows now :(
[09:13:47] <Cl0udNinja> I mean, there are like 5 ways to setup/install sshd on a windows system... 
[09:13:59] <Cl0udNinja> also, sup nerrrrddsss
[09:14:04] <e1> sahhhh Cl0udNinja 
[09:14:10] <xe0n> e1: you can?
[09:14:11] <xe0n> iis
[09:14:13] <Cl0udNinja> suuuuuhhhhhhrrraahhhh
[09:14:28] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, brb installing iis ftp
[09:14:31] <xe0n> wait sorry scp is using 22, but yeah there's an sshd _now_, previously, not
[09:14:41] <e1> Yeah still have to set that up
[09:14:42] <Cl0udNinja> scp uses sshd under the hood
[09:14:45] <xe0n> correct
[09:14:47] <xe0n> yeah
[09:14:47] <e1> which seems pointless, personally
[09:14:57] <e1> you can psexec to windows machines cant you
[09:14:57] <Cl0udNinja> it has its uses
[09:15:10] <e1> I like ssh built into windows, idk about sshd except maybe socks proxy
[09:15:19] <e1> Can you x11 forward from windows via it's 'built in' sshd?
[09:15:25] <Cl0udNinja> sshd = ssh daemon
[09:15:33] <JollyRgrs> you mean x11 fwd windows to linux?
[09:15:34] <Cl0udNinja> no... I dont think you can
[09:15:37] <e1> yea
[09:15:44] <JollyRgrs> considering the GUI is not X Server...
[09:15:46] <JollyRgrs> no?
[09:15:49] <e1> obv not real x11 forward, but would be cool if they did like a remoteapp thing
[09:16:02] <Cl0udNinja> WSL isnt even in a real-ish linux env
[09:16:10] <e1> clearly windows is running wayland JollyRgrs  i know this
[09:16:12] <Cl0udNinja> ping? lol nope
[09:16:45] <xe0n> correct, it's not, it's for development and specific use cases, its not really a consumer feature lol
[09:17:20] <e1> damn handy tho
[09:17:25] <xe0n> yup
[09:17:28] <Cl0udNinja> the only use WSL has for me is being able to ssh and git  without remembering two oses commands
[09:17:38] <xe0n> use an IDE?
[09:17:38] <xe0n> lol
[09:17:41] <e1> git commit been playing up for me tho
[09:17:44] <e1> I hate IDEs
[09:17:48] <xe0n> vscode works well with both of them lol
[09:17:55] <e1> Tries to force me to do things there way
[09:18:01] <Cl0udNinja> not everything in git is code :P
[09:18:03] <e1> I dont need some great whopping application just to git remote add
[09:18:15] <xe0n> vscode is lightweight?
[09:18:16] <xe0n> lol
[09:18:23] <e1> lighter than git cli?
[09:18:29] <Cl0udNinja> I tried out vscode, didnt like it
[09:18:33] <Cl0udNinja> felt like a glorified notepad
[09:18:42] <e1> glorified is putting it nicely
[09:18:46] <Cl0udNinja> and of course, visual studio is too fucking much
[09:19:26] <e1> I'm genuinely considering paying a license for sublime text/merge
[09:19:33] <e1> Just for the ctrl+shift+L
[09:19:46] <JollyRgrs> sshd is not WSL, btw
[09:19:48] <Cl0udNinja> I usually go for komodoedit, but the last versions felt heavy
[09:19:55] <JollyRgrs> you can SSHD into cmd.exe or powershell or whatever
[09:20:01] <xe0n> ^
[09:20:06] <e1> oh really
[09:20:07] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, yeah I know, I mentioned there was multiple ways to install ssh as a daemon
[09:20:11] <xe0n> yes...
[09:20:11] <xe0n> lol
[09:20:18] <xe0n> WSL is...WSL, ssh can run without wsl lol
[09:20:21] <e1> I have zero reason to install sshd on a windows machine lol
[09:20:30] <Jett[m]> I end up just using the CLI even in VS Code lol
[09:20:34] <xe0n> ^
[09:20:51] <Jett[m]> Would very much reccomend posh git for Powershell
[09:20:57] <xe0n> exactly, why have multiple windows open when i can do it all in one interface that intergrates nicely
[09:21:14] <e1> because that's the whole reason for having a cascading windows manager
[09:21:15] <xe0n> integrates*
[09:21:20] <xe0n> lolll
[09:22:26] <Cl0udNinja> btw did yall hear windows 11 stuff got leaked?
[09:22:33] <e1> 'leaked'
[09:22:35] <e1> teased more like it
[09:22:36] <Cl0udNinja> right
[09:22:48] <e1> Sorry, you're referring to Windows KDE, right?
[09:22:49] <Cl0udNinja> I havent looked directly, but everyone is saying it looks like a rethemed windows 10
[09:22:59] <Jett[m]> Yeah, there's an ISO floating around as well
[09:23:01] <xe0n> no shit, im not sure what people expect
[09:23:11] <Jett[m]> It activates with a standard W10 license key lmao
[09:23:12] <xe0n> thats exactly what we've been expecting, a new user interface built on top of windows 10
[09:23:16] <xe0n> its not going to be radically different
[09:23:18] <e1> It looks nothing like Windows 10 - the start menus in the center!
[09:23:22] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, at least, until it is
[09:23:24] <xe0n> can be moved to the left lol
[09:23:28] <e1> booo
[09:23:35] <Cl0udNinja> you know damn well they are gonna fuck up the UI again
[09:23:36] <e1> only boomers will move to the left
[09:24:08] <Cl0udNinja> I keep mine on the right :D
[09:24:31] <xe0n> Cl0udNinja: i'd recommend you follow someone of the analysts, i.e. paul thurrott or mary jo foley, who have pretty close connections to inside goss, they've been saying for the past three months this is what i was going to be
[09:24:40] <xe0n> expectations are high for people who aren't grounded in reality haha
[09:24:46] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[09:24:55] <e1> mmhmm I can concur with that
[09:25:09] <e1> I am very realistic and have zero expectations from windows 11 other than paying more money for the same thing
[09:25:17] <Cl0udNinja> I dont even really care that much, I doubt I'll even consider upgrading immediately anyway, and I dont get crazy like back in the windows xp / weeesta days
[09:25:19] <xe0n> it'll be a free upgrade, as per windows 10
[09:25:19] <xe0n> lol
[09:25:23] * e1 is waiting to pay for windows as a service
[09:25:56] * nobyk is waiting to use Windows for free
[09:25:58] <nobyk> :)
[09:26:09] <xe0n> the pressure for a new ui is coming from hardware vendors who are trying to sell pcs and give people a reason, from a consumer side it's like why buy a pc with windows that looks like X when my current machine also looks like X
[09:26:09] <Cl0udNinja> e1, I'm pretty sure there would be a mass uprising if that were to happen
[09:26:31] <e1> Cl0udNinja: pretty sure people were syaing that about office and adobe
[09:26:44] <xe0n> windows is ALREADY a service lol!
[09:26:56] <xe0n> windows 10 uses the services model
[09:26:57] <xe0n> lol!
[09:26:57] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, I think he means like monthly subscription
[09:27:04] <xe0n> you can also have that, AVD
[09:27:06] <e1> yes, and i'm talking consumer
[09:27:08] <xe0n> and cloudPC is coming for the consumer side
[09:27:13] <xe0n> yes, it's already in internal testing
[09:27:16] <e1> like "buy this laptop and get 12 months free windows"
[09:27:19] <Cl0udNinja> HOW BOUT NOOOO BOB

[10:44:28] <Cl0udNinja> I'd do anything for him, so its gonna happen, but its a killer on the wallet
[10:44:49] <Cl0udNinja> and then, once hes recovered, guess who is also probably going to have knee surgery

[20:17:24] <int0x1C8> aab_, the alias/user does exist and is used though
[20:18:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> int0x1C8 technically it would work you'd just have a SAM Account name of something like HR.Co4 
[20:18:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> and then you would have to over-ride the email address policy to only have the hr@domain4
[20:18:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> account
[20:18:49] <int0x1C8> oh right
[20:19:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> you could even have a UPN of hr@domain4 if you really wanted to 
[20:19:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> not sure i'd bother with that
[20:20:01] <int0x1C8> yeah the email policy that applies to users from that company sets domain4 as primary smtp, but also domain1

[23:25:48] <grumplestiltzkin> just strategy-wise: if you do something super niche, or that a business generally just won't have someone on staff with the skillset, there's the target area for consulting. If you have some work, and it would take your guys a week to figure it out, then another week to find best practices and plan it, then another week to implement it, for a team of 3 - if you can just pay a consultant who does it all the time, even if it costs more, 
[23:25:48] <grumplestiltzkin> the time saved (time is money), and knowing it was done right, and also having someone concrete to blame if things go wrong, can make it *very* appealing
[23:27:36] <grumplestiltzkin> it gets even *more* attractive if your project invovles changing production
