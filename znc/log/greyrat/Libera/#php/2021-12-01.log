[05:23:06] <Rockwood> how to use session value in JS based front end when i save values by PHP in session
[05:24:49] <Blondie101010> by having PHP output them for JS to use
[05:27:32] <Rockwood> suppose if i am chking use auth
[05:28:03] <Rockwood> after auth values are saves session
[05:28:35] <Rockwood> ah okay got it
[05:28:38] <Rockwood> thanks
[05:29:16] <Blondie101010> note that the front end should not really know its current session state
[05:29:42] <Blondie101010> it can know it authenticated successfully at some point, but that may change without the front end knowing

[05:31:42] <Rockwood> i have access many pages
[05:31:47] <Rockwood> i have to
[05:31:54] <Blondie101010> no, that's the point
[05:32:02] <Rockwood> means
[05:32:19] <Blondie101010> JS should not try to control what you have access to
[05:32:35] <Rockwood> i have 2 routes
[05:32:47] <Blondie101010> so what
[05:33:01] <Rockwood> one in JS and another in PHP and ajax access methods by PHP routes
[05:33:14] <Blondie101010> again: so what?
[05:33:28] <Rockwood> JS route will be responsible accessing scripts
[05:33:33] *** Joins: luigibu1 (~luigibu@80.30.201.209)
[05:33:40] <Rockwood> i means frontend
[05:33:50] <Blondie101010> it only makes the calls
[05:34:00] <Blondie101010> it does not decide what you have access to
[05:34:46] <Blondie101010> therefore if you want to know if you're still logged in, you do an operation that requires auth
[05:34:46] <Rockwood> really your point still not clear to me
[05:35:19] <Rockwood> you means i have to make something like PHP auth + JS Auth
[05:35:35] <Blondie101010> the point is to stop trying to give any kind of control to JS for things it does not and should not control
[05:36:00] <Blondie101010> there's no such thing as front-end JS auth
[05:36:16] <Blondie101010> that'd be like giving a key to the user and telling them not to use it
[05:36:58] <Rockwood> you means fetch will be does this?
[05:37:15] <Blondie101010> do what?
[05:37:20] <Rockwood> nah
[05:37:26] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[05:37:27] <Blondie101010> if you do a HTTP request that requires auth, what happens?
[05:37:35] <Blondie101010> you get prompted/notified
[05:37:41] <Blondie101010> so then you auth
[05:37:47] <Blondie101010> that's how it works

[05:38:19] <Rockwood> [07:37:43] <Blondie101010> you get prompted/notified hmm
[05:39:41] <Blondie101010> many secure sites will let their JS front-end know how long the session should last, and redirect or warn when it expires, but even then there are cases the front end would not know about, like if you changed your password on another computer
[05:40:05] <Blondie101010> the front-end can not do more than check
[05:40:28] <Rockwood> chks every time?
[05:41:12] <Blondie101010> for what?
[05:41:37] <Blondie101010> why do you need your JS script to keep checking if your auth is still valid?
[05:41:41] <Blondie101010> that's crazy
[05:42:08] <Rockwood> actually my frontend having lots of scripts
[05:42:19] <Blondie101010> ok I'm done
[05:42:26] <Rockwood> every script means a webpage
[05:42:34] <Blondie101010> adding irrelevant garbage doesn't help
[05:43:57] <Blondie101010> you're giving me the impression that your front-end is protecting something, and I sure hope it's not the case or you'll get fired
[05:44:16] <Blondie101010> because it wouldn't
[05:44:48] <Rockwood> actually me to wants backend should responsible to backend stuff and frontend should be responsible frontend only
[05:45:02] <Blondie101010> it's not a choice
[05:45:08] <Blondie101010> the only choice is to pretend
[05:45:19] <Blondie101010> the front end CAN NOT control security!

I have a network utility called "dig.php", code: https://dpaste.org/sgVH , which relies on db.php: https://dpaste.org/tjhN ... I'd like to avoid repeating the prepared statements, for which I've created functions, and I'm really not sure if it's the right way to do. So if anyone could take a look at the pastes and point
[18:38:50] <skyroveRR> out what's wrong, I'd be deeply appreciative. Also, dig.php contains invocation of the functions too. Namely "pdoinit" and "submitlookup".
[18:40:35] <skyroveRR> The prepared statements are in dig.php, which I'd like to move to db.php, where other utilities can grab them as functions also. Like ping.php and other network utils, for which I'm creating some front ends.

[19:32:15] <skyroveRR> __adrian: ok sorry. https://dpaste.org/tjhN#L102,103,104 <- I have a prepared statement in those lines. We both earlier had an extremely brief discussion about pdovisit not being in scope, for which you suggested that I should try arguments inside functions. Something like submitlookup($pdovisit), where $pdovisit is already defined somewhere. But I'm not able to put your idea to work because I've not understood
[19:32:17] <skyroveRR> it as well as I should. Also, those prepared statements, I'm gonna need to invoke those repeatedly. The thing is, I can't simply put them inside a function, because they would be in local scope and won't be "global". So I've created a new paste. You can disregard my older pastes, here's the new one based on the discussion we had earlier: https://dpaste.org/Zmqi <- is the function between lines 76 and 91 ok as

[20:19:31] <Naktibalda> are you aware that prepared statements don't persist between requests
[20:21:25] <skyroveRR> Just learnt that the hard way I think. I placed most of the prepared statements inside functions and was surprised the submit button count wasn't increasing.
[20:22:27] <Naktibalda> by the way, you could replace IF (SELECT) UPDATE else INSERT with a single statement
[20:22:38] <Naktibalda> INSERT INTO visitors (date, visitorip, visitorcount) VALUES (?, ?, 0) ON CONFLICT(date, visitorip) DO UPDATE SET visitorcount=visitorcount+1
[20:23:10] <skyroveRR> Nice idea.
[20:24:59] <Naktibalda> prepared statements improve performance if you repeat the same statement in a loop
[20:25:11] <__adrian> skyroveRR: so, you're getting into a design where it really would be useful to make a class  :)
[20:25:27] <skyroveRR> I've never explored classes.
[20:25:37] <__adrian> i figured
[20:25:46] <skyroveRR> I guess it's the right time to check them out.
[20:25:53] <__adrian> but it would provide a way to maange this state that you want to carry around
[20:26:05] <__adrian> moment.
[20:26:19] <__adrian> (you can start here: https://php.net/oop )
[20:32:02] <judah> One fun (controversial) note for procedural vs. oop skyroveRR, and everyone has their own opinion on the matter. Procedural programming means "do X with Y data" where OOP means "represent Y data in X way"
[20:32:57] <skyroveRR> judah: that will take a while to parse.
[20:34:14] <judah> When I was first starting out I got stuck in the mindset that a class had to _do_ something, but thats not necessarily the case. Class methods can do things, but thats just fancy procedural code. The class itself is just a representation of its data

[20:39:05] <skyroveRR> judah: I'm a slow learner :) I still remember an idea __adrian suggested while we were still on freenode. The idea was, the code I was writing, and at that point, I was brand new to PHP, it had only been a few days just, and he asked me to write code in just one page instead of multiple files. PHP code at the top, and only HTML at the bottom. Of course, PHP shorthand can be added at the bottom because you need
[20:39:07] <skyroveRR> that output. Funny thing is, I was able to accomplish that only a couple of days back last november, when I decided to provide this network services like ping/traceroute/dig stuff. Like for example almost complete logic at the top, and only HTML code at the bottom. At that point in time I thought it was undoable. :/ .
[20:39:51] <__adrian> once you do the  top|bottom  page, feel free to split it into two pages  ;)
[20:41:03] <skyroveRR> Well all the HTML errors-related stuff is in html.php, but as per your suggestion, I'm not mixing and making a spaghetti out of PHP/HTML code :D

[23:54:50] <hans> have a strange issue with 8.0.13, it seems that when i give `php -l` >=16 arguments, it only cares about the first 15 arguments? o.0
[23:55:10] <relipse> what terminal are you using hans
[23:55:58] <hans> xfce4-terminal, $SHELL is /bin/bash , gnu bash 5.0.17 , but it shouldn't matter, because i'm not using bash to pass the arguments
[23:56:20] <physikoi> hello #php. https://github.com/consolidation/cgr had once been my goto solution for installing global composer libraries; unfortunately, it's not compatible with v8. Also unfortunately, it *seems* composer still does not handle dependency clashing for global libraries installation. Or, am I missing something? Help plz
[23:56:23] <hans> i'm noticing the error with the command find -iname "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 php -l
[23:56:33] <hans> find returns ~1700 php files
[23:56:39] <hans> but php -l just checks the first 15 of them
[23:56:50] <hans> xargs however, caps it to 50 arguments per invocation by default, iirc
[23:57:40] <hans> s/error/issue
[23:59:24] <hans> can anyone try to reproduce? just run that exact command in a folder which recursively have more than 16 php files in it
[23:59:35] <hans> if you get more than 15 lines, it did not reproduce
