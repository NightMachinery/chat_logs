[04:09:17] *** Joins: arcticlimer (~vini@167-249-93-241.static.rnvtelecom.com.br)
[04:09:23] <mjlbach[m]> To be honest I got distracted with some other problems but those fires are now out :) 
[04:10:33] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> No worries. I've had much less time after vimconf to knock out pending work, so there was no rush on this :)
[04:10:44] <mjlbach[m]> Did you want to pass a stream directly to start_client?
[04:11:50] <mjlbach[m]> (also you might be interested in https://neovim.discourse.group/t/discussion-on-the-future-of-lspconfig-and-neovims-lsp-ecosystem/1824/5)
[04:13:03] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> I need to be able to swap out certain functions to call distant's API instead of libuv. That's the main thing. Since it looks like neovim reads and writes to a language server using pipes, supporting a way to pass in a method to create and return Lua objects that have some pipe-like interface is all I need.
[04:13:32] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Listed those in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15847
[04:15:15] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, I know what you need but I'm wondering about the interface
[04:15:21] <mjlbach[m]> > the scalable idea here would be to allow passing a function that can be called, defaulting to uv.spawn if none is provided.
[04:15:54] <mjlbach[m]> One option is this, the other would be I let you pass in an input, output, and status "stream"
[04:16:16] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> I think either is fine.
[04:16:31] <mjlbach[m]> Kinda like here https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16835/files#diff-c6a4160a416b22cd1fd833b8f852c4fbaf1f25adf75053e82a1025aa2c607ac9R816-R820
[04:17:02] <mjlbach[m]> I'm just wondering if you have a usecase for replacing uv.spawn wholesale rather than passing in the handles
[04:17:11] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> If I were to pass streams directly, how do I get the information that would have originally been fed into uv.spawn?
[04:17:39] <mjlbach[m]> What do you mean? I'm assuming you would be the one calling start_client
[04:18:07] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Ah, if that's the case, then passing streams is fine.
[04:18:40] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Was just thinking in terms of lspconfig, which handles calling start_client for you, knowing what parameters to include and when to invoke it.
[04:18:48] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah lspconfig will not do that in the future
[04:19:06] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Oh, is that being moved elsewhere? Or is it up to users?
[04:19:12] <mjlbach[m]> Planning on moving that into a new project-centric interface in neovim core
[04:19:28] <mjlbach[m]> You could have "local" and "remote" projects that call start_client with different arguments
[04:23:29] *** Quits: arcticlimer (~vini@167-249-93-241.static.rnvtelecom.com.br) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:28:50] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Sure, that seems reasonable. How are projects managed? I'm assuming there would be a way to externally indicate which project a buffer belongs to? In distant's case, it looks up a buffer-local variable providing the remote path, although the buffer's name itself of distant://path/to/file would also indicate that it isn't normal.

[07:03:37] <rhcher[m]> I turned on the document highlighting feature, you can see that the position of the cursor and the highlighted position is different.
[07:04:57] <rhcher[m]> If I press the K key, the hovor of `test` is displayed.

[07:06:11] <rhcher[m]> If I save this buffer, everything works well.
[07:06:37] <mjlbach[m]> Just send me the cpp file
[07:06:44] <mjlbach[m]> or a minimal file that you have the issue with
[07:06:50] <mjlbach[m]> I don't need your config
[07:07:13] <mjlbach[m]> and I assume you are on master?

[07:35:38] <constxd> i wanna write a LSP server
[07:36:02] <constxd> anyone good resources / examples
[07:36:05] *** Joins: justIrresolute (~justache@user/justache)
[07:40:16] <constxd> wait no
[07:40:32] <constxd> i really just want syntax highlighting
[07:40:41] <constxd> so i guess LSP isn't the right thing
[07:40:58] <constxd> but ideally i don't want to write a tree-sitter grammar or a vim syntax file
[07:41:30] <mjlbach[m]> writing a language server is more involved than writing a treesitter grammar :)
[07:41:48] <constxd> i don't know if that's true
[07:42:19] <constxd> the example javascript grammar is pretty daunting
[07:42:34] <mjlbach[m]> you still need to parse code if you write a language server :) 
[07:42:42] <constxd> yes that's the thing
[07:42:47] <constxd> i already have a parser
[07:42:55] <constxd> which is why i don't want to have to write a tree-sitter grammar
[07:42:58] *** Joins: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat)
[07:43:03] <constxd> i want to use the parser i already have
[07:43:43] <mjlbach[m]> in that case, it's not too bad. probably easiest in JS since language-server-node is the reference implementation
[07:44:48] <constxd> but from what i can tell, that doesn't actually get you syntax highlighting does it
[07:45:03] <constxd> just go-to-definition and code completion and stuff
[07:45:24] <mjlbach[m]> it gets you semantic tokens 
[07:45:28] <mjlbach[m]> which is part of the protocol
[07:45:43] <mjlbach[m]> neovim currently doesn't support it but there is an open PR
[07:46:04] <constxd> so currently if i want syntax highlighting
[07:46:13] <constxd> the options are tree-sitter or vimscript

[18:22:45] <Intelo> also, now people use awk instead of sed/regex things. I am so confused on which / what to do
[18:23:01] <JulianJulianBerm> all unix definitely does not use the same flavor of regex :)

[18:29:44] <Bowuigi[m]> `.` matches a character, `^` matches the beggining of the line if it is the first character, `$` is like `^` but matching the end of the line instead, most characters match themselves, you can group more than one thing with `[abc]d` which matches `aa`, `ab` and `ac`
[18:30:38] <Bowuigi[m]> There are modifiers, for example, `?` which makes the previous match optional, `*` that matches zero or more, `+` that matches one or more

[18:34:19] <JulianJulianBerm> it is not worth learning them ahead of time
