[12:30:27] <jtgd> The-Compiler: I've read the link you gave and experimented more and I can't find anything that works and don't see why, according to that link.
[12:31:45] <jtgd> seems like this should work: 'https://*redditmail.com/*'
[12:32:57] <toofar> you can't do *word in there
[12:33:04] <toofar> > '*' in the host can be followed only by a '.' or '/'
[12:33:48] <jtgd> ok
[12:34:11] <jtgd> sad they couldn't have used regex.
[12:34:34] <jtgd> thanks for the tip.
[12:35:08] <The-Compiler> jtgd: nah, regex is a pain for URLs in various ways
[12:36:17] <The-Compiler> jtgd: it's much slower (the restrictions in patterns is because it makes the checking of those patterns against network requests much simpler, only simple comparisons basically); and it's also much more awkward for users (dots happen to be rather common in URLs)
[12:36:19] <jtgd> so I would have to state both 'http://' and 'https://' instead of 'https?://' :( 
[12:37:16] <jtgd> ah well, works well enough.

[14:30:37] <The-Compiler> arza: so if you want 5.12 but compatibility to newer glibc, I suppose you will need to build from source manually, with that patch backported somehow
[14:31:03] <The-Compiler> arza: or disable the seccomp BPF sandbox
[14:31:59] <The-Compiler> arza: note that I plan to drop Qt 5.12 (probably < 5.15) support for qutebrowser v3.0.0, Qt 5.12 has been EOL since December
[14:32:24] <arza> and a working 5.15 venv might be useful anyway for testing
[14:33:23] <The-Compiler> same story there unfortunately - if you need that patch you will need to build from source, I just use Archlinux' Qt (can use --pyqt-type link) and disable the sandbox if I really need an older 5.15 for testing

[21:44:29] <sim590> Every time I start Qutebrowser, it crashes like this.
[21:44:52] <sim590> It started doing this after updating.
[21:46:18] <topcat001> that's because you don't have the system configures with the MS sysmbol server
[21:46:44] <topcat001> However that message is not the main reason; rather a consequence
[21:46:51] <sim590> Ah OK. Hmmm. Then, I don't know how to get the error of the crash.
[21:47:22] <sim590> I tried to to get the error following the recommended procedure on the qutebrowser website.
[21:47:32] <topcat001> Please post the actual error code and message from Event Viewer, Administrative Events under Custom on the lft pane.

[21:53:00] <sim590> But the exception code seems to be 0xc0000005
[21:53:19] <sim590> It fails in Qt5WebEngineCore.dll
[21:53:27] <sim590> version 5.15.2.0
[21:54:44] <The-Compiler> sim590: does it crash immediately? Can you try starting it via the command line with --temp-basedir?
[21:54:52] <topcat001> That's a memory access violation (or in Linux speak a segemtation fault)
[21:55:25] <sim590> The-Compiler: yeah it crashes immediately. Let me try if it works with --temp-basedir.
[21:55:42] <topcat001> sim590: what is the "Faulting module"? ntdll?
[21:56:00] <topcat001> the error report will list that
[21:56:17] <topcat001> ah you said already
[21:56:45] <topcat001> so a segmentation fault withing QT5WebEngineCore.dll
[21:57:03] <sim590> It doesn't crash with --temp-dir. I'm not sure if it's related to the tabs that were reopening or my config.
[21:57:21] <topcat001> yes as The-Compiler said please try a temp basedir; could be the config parsing code that's crashing (in QT).
[21:57:30] <topcat001> aha
[21:58:06] <topcat001> well the QT version was recently updated and it tries to convert the config (again in QT)
[21:58:18] <sim590> That's weird. I restarted qutebrwoser without --temp-basedir and now it doesn't crash anymore, but I didn't change anything
[21:58:19] <topcat001> so maybe that crashes for you due to some reason
[21:59:14] <topcat001> it might still write something to the original dir (you can use Performance Monitor in Windows to track the disk writes and files for a process BTW).
[21:59:25] <sim590> Yeah, I do have this popup about the autoconfig loading not specified which I stubornly never resolved on Windows.
[22:00:35] <topcat001> In any case if you can recreate your profile from scratch (the QT bits, not necessarily QB bits) by perhaps just deleting the QTWebEngine directories, that might be worth doing.
[22:01:12] <topcat001> in any case most likely not a problem with QB itself
