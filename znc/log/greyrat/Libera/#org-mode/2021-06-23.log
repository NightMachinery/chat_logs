[11:13:55] <wehlutyk[m]> Hello all!
[11:17:15] <wehlutyk[m]> I use orgmode and the agenda everyday, combined with org-journal (https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal). I'm looking for a way to have org-journal store completed items using their full outline path, and not only the leaf of the tree. Org-journal people told me this can probably be done by tweaking org-capture (see here for the bug I filed: https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal/issues/349 ). Does someone here know how I can do this?

[11:31:13] <wehlutyk[m]> Hmm, that would be %f of %F then? I'm looking for the outline of an org item, so including all the parent items. My guess is there is a function I can call and include in %(exp) in the template, but I don't know which function will give me the full outline of an item

[16:57:56] <empwilli_> I want to set some variables for an org file for export and keep these variables local to the file. I've read about #+BIND/#+OPTIONS; however, the value is too long so I'd rather set the options in some inline code block and evaluate that before export. Is this possible?

[17:12:48] <Demosthenex> tyson2: why would you capture to the current buffer?
[17:16:35] <tyson2> Demosthenex: I am implementing a goal management strategy which uses hierarchical tags.  There is a regex tag template G@, but I want to define the goals in each individual org file, so that completion will work without switching to global tag completion.
[17:17:23] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[17:17:24] <tyson2> so when creationg a new goal, I want it to be created as a headline within the current buffer.

[17:20:09] <Demosthenex> tyson2: maybe yassnippet, skel/abbrev, or another templating engine?
[17:20:35] <Demosthenex> while technically capture includes a templating engine, capture was meant to allow you to rapidly take a note and file it away in a known location without interrupting your workflow
[17:20:48] <tyson2> Makes sense.  I have looked at those but haven't yet made use of them.  I will investigate.
[17:24:29] <empwilli_> Demosthenex: you mean sth. like this? https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html ? The thing is: It's a multiline string (~20 lines)
