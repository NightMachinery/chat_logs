[00:08:38] <Henry151> so, looking at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17261551/how-can-i-use-sqlalchemy-to-do-mysql-explain and trying to do the technique at the bottom of the first answer
[00:09:26] <Henry151> the one like DBSession().execute('EXPLAIN ' + query, {'param_1': 'value1', 'param_2': 'value2'}) ... but i'm finding it doesn't seem to work the way shown there, and i want to understand why
[00:09:43] *** erica is now known as birb
[00:10:38] <Henry151> if query = str(DBSession().query(Model).filter(***)) , and i look at query and see it has things in it like %(variable_name) , my understanding was that those are the "bound parameters" talked about

Putting the dictionary inside the DBSession().execute() like shown in the stack overflow page doesn't seem to work for me.

[02:15:46] <aum> hi guys - got a performance dilemma - SQLite way too slow. Considering implementing schema and storage instead into a directory tree, with careful conventions to optimise the required create/search/read/delete operations. Is this likely to achieve significant speedups, or could it be wasted effort. (OS: Debian Stable, Python: 3.9, filesystem: ext4)
[02:15:58] <rud0lf> it was transported to communication pipe "input end" or that is has been successfully sent and received by get() ?
[02:16:08] <rud0lf> is has = it has
[02:16:18] <grym> aum: "sqlite is slow" usually means "my indexes are wrong!"
[02:16:47] <rud0lf> i'm trying to convert a program that uses multiprocessing to a simple version with threads
[02:16:50] <aum> grym: that, and the Tortoise ORM I'm using over the top of it is a stodgy bottleneck
[02:16:51] <grym> (or "my schema is poorly thought out for what i need it to do")
[02:16:59] <rud0lf> and i need to understand never used before "JoinableQueue"
[02:17:07] <grym> aum: you could investigate more performant ORMs
[02:17:45] <aum> grym, that, or migrate to raw aiosqlite SQL queries, and stop relying on ORM for convenience
[02:18:47] <aum> schema is simple - no related joins, just 3 tiers with each of the bottom 2 tiers having foreign key to the tier above
[02:18:58] <aum> I think TortoiseORM might be my big bottleneck

[02:23:03] <rud0lf> just Queue, no .join_thread() needed?
[02:23:26] <rud0lf> as i think multiprocessing queue thread is needed for multiple processes
[02:23:36] <rud0lf> which does not take part for threads that share memory
[02:23:52] <rud0lf> one more thing i'm dumb about
[02:24:17] <rud0lf> if two instances of threading.Thread are running, do they share for example method variables?
[02:24:39] <rud0lf> if i use "flag = True" in one thread will other thread read it or will it spawn own copy?
[02:25:08] <rud0lf> since local variable storage exists, i believe method (and function) variables are shared :/
[02:25:20] <rud0lf> why would the storage be there otherwise?
[02:25:39] <Yhg1s> rud0lf: I don't understand what you mean by 'local variable storage'.
[02:26:06] <rud0lf> thread variables
[02:26:07] <Yhg1s> rud0lf: methods are not different from functions. local variables are local to the call. They can, by definition, never be shared. However, while the *variables* aren't shared, the *objects they refer to* can be.
[02:26:14] <rud0lf> mydata = threading.local()

[02:27:13] <bjs> rud0lf: threading.local() != "local" variables
[02:27:19] <Yhg1s> rud0lf: you're not avoiding threads, so, yeah, you're missing that part. Avoid threads.
[02:27:22] <rud0lf> so i'm not 100% sane, please bear with me :)
[02:30:27] <bjs> rud0lf: but yes, if you make two threading.Thread's they share the same objects,  and share global variables. Unlike a process

[02:49:53] <squarecircle> bjs: that why I'd kill the subprocess, so that no objects remain
[02:50:05] <bjs> the problem is at this point the "old" library will still be around, and some places might continue making "old" objects and some might make "new" objects,  and the "new" objects will not work with the "old" ones and all manner of bad things would happen

[10:04:57] <mattf> Does anyone how does it work on the irc protocol to send multiple lines on a single message instantly? I am using something like: f"PRIVMSG {channel} :{message} \r\n"
[10:06:28] <mattf> if I combine multiple of those in the same packed (as s single encoded string) the server will display them slowly with a considerable delay between them. I am trying to figure out what is sent when you write "multiple lines" on your irc client and they arrive instantly and display instantly. Or does such thing doesn't exist and is just an impression I have since I sen't the messages myself then the irc client can display it instantly?
[10:07:37] <kline> >slowly with a considerable delay
[10:07:58] <kline> mattf, its far more likely that something on your end is throttling the outgoing to avoid getting killed for flooding
[10:08:12] <mattf> kline
[10:08:17] <mattf> send me 10 lines on privaet
[10:08:25] <kline> ok
[10:08:30] <kline> let me grab something to copy
[10:08:34] <mattf> thanks
[10:09:08] <Wulf> mattf: the irc server may throttle you as well. Only a few lines will get sent fast.

[10:10:12] <Wulf> kline: sounds good :)
[10:10:20] <kline> or else someone could just connect a lot of clients and then max it out to try and oom kill the ircd

[10:15:27] <Wulf> kline: I just tried on libera using "telnet". I wasn't killed for flooding, my other client received messages delayed.
[10:15:39] <mattf> maybe with some setting he could at least let 20 messages
[10:16:05] <Wulf> kline: I believe the server got a limit on reading and a limited buffer for a client's receive buffer. Only when this buffer overflows the client is disconnected.

[11:45:26] <jinsun> yes everything is instance of object, so functions get that even if it might not be useful for function objects
[11:45:51] <rendar> but it is useful
[11:46:12] <rendar> i wonder to understand why is that, i always imagined functions as instances of object() with __call__ implemented, and that's all
[11:50:03] <jinsun> ah ok, I didn't see properly, it is required onl for descriptors, no idea why functions have __get__ then
[11:50:46] <BrenBarn> I think it is useful for function objects, as that's what lets methods work
[11:51:10] <rendar> BrenBarn, can you explain it further?
[11:51:41] <BrenBarn> let's say you have a class Foo
[11:51:45] <BrenBarn> then you create an instance `f`
[11:51:55] <rendar> yes
[11:51:55] <habnabit_> rendar, __get__ is what binds 'self' to a method
[11:52:01] <BrenBarn> and suppose the class has a method `go`

[14:32:20] <lericson> great example imo, i really don't think that should be an exception
[14:32:32] <wib_jonas> lericson: mostly because when you make the interface, you might not know which errors are expected in the calling code. this applies eg. to the system call interfaces in python. sometimes you expect certain errors, like EEXIST for os.mkdir or ENOENT for os.remove. but not every code expects the same errors. it's easier to make the interfaces raise
[14:32:32] <wib_jonas> an exception for all errors, and catch them, rather than trying to figure out which errors each call shouldn't raise an exception for.

[14:33:17] <kosh> lericson, the advantage is that it provides a way to know that you have an error since a return code of some kind would need to be a value that could never be stored in a dict which is a problem
[14:33:59] <wib_jonas> lericson: now if you're writing a function that you only use yourself, not expose in a library, then sure, I won't use exception handling. I'll return a value if I want to handle it, and die a fatal error if I don't want to handle a result.
[14:34:11] <kosh> best practice is try:   value = somedict[key]  except KeyError:  dosomething      if the .get approach is not sufficient

[14:35:59] <lericson> i've written python for a long time, and exception-based signalling just looks odd to me

[14:37:32] <kosh> lericson, the issue is that sometimes there is no good value to use to indicate a key is not present and the exception provides a clean way to handle it
[14:37:38] <Yhg1s> lericson: dict.__getitem__ raising an exception isn't a signal. It's because there is no valid return value, and returning something else when it isn't explicitly requested (like dict.get) would be a source of bugs. It's an error.

[14:38:12] <lericson> there are many other ways to solve that problem, Yhg1s
[14:38:22] <wib_jonas> dict has an is operator to check if something exists, which I call instead of trying to handle the exception from __getitem__
[14:38:25] <Yhg1s> lericson: correct. Python chose this way. It does so consisently. It's a useful pattern.
[14:38:32] <lericson> but yes dict.__getitem__ is perhaps the more logical one
[14:38:33] <wib_jonas> the StopIteration is weird even to me, I admit\
[14:38:38] <kosh> lericson, I have dealt with cases where a dictionary only contained non None values originally so someone wrote code that just assumed None was not a valid key, until someone put a None in there later for a goood reason and a bunch of code broke
[14:38:45] <Yhg1s> Fortunately you don't have to worry about StopIteration.
[14:39:55] <wib_jonas> I also have code here that calls int or float to parse a number from a string, with an except call to handle the case when it's not a number.

[14:41:06] <Yhg1s> lericson: I'm not sure what I did to "sound" like that. I'm trying to answer your questions.
[14:41:27] <lericson> just as an example, go uses separate error returns
[14:41:33] <lericson> so, value, err = dict[foo]
[14:41:51] <lericson> Yhg1s: i see, it's less a question and more a discussion in my mind
[14:42:02] <kosh> lericson, it is also the problem with older c things for instance that would use special values to indicate an error, it is really nice to have the value return separated by an indication of an okay status
[14:42:20] <lericson> ah but C's inability to do anything useful is i think also a separate issue :p
[14:42:28] <Yhg1s> lericson: Go has that particular design choice, yes. It's because Google has had many problems with _C++_ exceptions, and so Rob Pike designed Go explicitly without exceptions. It's been a mistake from the start, really.
[14:42:34] <Yhg1s> It makes it much too easy to silently ignore errors.

I build my pipeline by calling a = generator_or_list(smth), b= generator_or_list(a); etc. - so if I want to debug, I can change the global variable and easily inspect the contents
[14:43:12] <Yhg1s> kosh: mostly, non-exception code (like C code) not getting to do the cleanup it meant to do.
[14:43:23] <lericson> gloomy: that is bound to lead to headaches
[14:43:27] <lesshaste>  I am implementing fast levenshtein distance code in C. If I use ctypes it seems there is an overhead but I am not sure how large. Do any of cython, cffi or ctypes seem plausible for tiny overheads?
[14:43:55] <deniska> gloomy: when debugging it's just easier to call list() directly on a thing you're interested in
[14:43:55] <lericson> lesshaste: i would opt for cython because levenshtein is a pretty simple algorithm
[14:44:04] <Yhg1s> lesshaste: cffi or cython will have the least overhead, because they can do much more at compiletime instead of runtime.

[14:44:57] <Yhg1s> gloomy: sounds like your generator_or_list function is a generator itself, which wouldn't happen with the code you showed.
[14:45:00] <lericson> yes, lesshaste, cffi does not require compilation
[14:45:10] <lesshaste> kosh, what causes the overhead with ctypes?
[14:45:15] <kosh> ctypes advantage is no compilation but high call overhead
[14:45:17] <lesshaste> lericson, thanks!
[14:45:26] <Yhg1s> lesshaste: cython is a separate language, really, almost but not quite unlike Python.
[14:45:28] <lericson> lesshaste: cython serves a different goal, where you'd write the algorithm in python-like syntax
[14:45:34] <Yhg1s> cffi doesn't _require_ compilation, but the sensible way to use it does involve compilation.
[14:45:51] <lesshaste> Yhg1s, it includes C it seems as a subset
[14:45:54] <kosh> but if you have a function to call that takes seconds to minutes to run then ctypes can be really nice
[14:46:13] <lesshaste> kosh, got you. Mine takes maybe 100 nanoseconds
[14:46:20] <Yhg1s> lesshaste: it doesn't really include C, no. It has some specific syntax that looks like C.

[15:16:07] <Yhg1s> ^-^hi: just that. adding builtin names. It's not a good idea, by and large.
[15:16:09] <habnabit_> ^-^hi, not without confusing your users
[15:16:37] <^-^hi> no, i mean for confusing my users and this kind of stuff
[15:17:31] <lericson> you could start adding emoji names to common built-ins
[15:17:58] <lericson> 🖨("hello world")
[15:18:00] <lericson> beautiful
[15:18:00] <^-^hi> could anything be done with that, that could not be done with simple redefinition? like if simply declare a function len, it would replace builtin len

[15:20:30] <lericson> ^-^hi: also, if you're into writing strange code, unicode has some pretty exciting properties when comparing strings
[15:20:51] <braxas> hi, is there some way to simplify unpacking of args for overloads? like say I have this:  https://bpa.st/4L5A - the only way I can think of implementing that function is basically to match args and kwargs conditions for each case, and then use lambdas to unpack and use them
[15:20:57] <braxas> is there something that makes this easier?
[15:21:10] <habnabit_> braxas, simpler: don't use overloads
[15:21:23] <braxas> yeah
[15:21:39] <braxas> let me do that
[15:22:24] <habnabit_> braxas, there's `singledispatch` for things like operator overloading, but i strongly suggest avoiding overloading whenever possible. python doesn't make it easy
[15:22:43] <braxas> will check out singledispatch
[15:23:03] <habnabit_> braxas, @overload is specifically for dealing with functions that have thorny signatures, _not_ generalized method overloading
[15:23:20] *** Joins: molt (~molt@178-223-40-94.dynamic.isp.telekom.rs)
[15:23:58] <habnabit_> braxas, because python's typing system is not very good and functions have long had signatures which would require dependent typing to resolve (without overgeneralizing)
[15:24:06] <^-^hi> lericson: like similar looking but numerically different letters you mean?
[15:24:52] *** Joins: cdown_ (~cdown@163.114.131.1)

[19:04:12] <rendar> Yhg1s, if i have `def f(): pass` in my module, that's a free function not defined in a class body, still it has __get__

[19:04:26] <Yhg1s> rendar: yes.
[19:04:29] <rendar> why?
[19:04:43] <Yhg1s> rendar: because it's how methods work.
[19:05:15] <rendar> and how's that? why that f has __get__? how that's called? and when?
[19:05:36] <Yhg1s> rendar: I'm not sure what to say other than what I already have. __get__ is called when it's fetched from a class object.

[19:05:55] <Yhg1s> rendar: 'def' creates a function. So does lambda. The type doesn't change depending on where it is defined.
[19:06:21] <HolyTaint> I need to run an async function in another process while already being in an async function, how could I do that?
[19:06:48] <rendar> Yhg1s, are you saying that if i have `def f(): pass` its __get__ is useful only when i pass that function inside a class body?
[19:07:36] <Yhg1s> rendar: no, I'm saying the *type* has the __get__ method in order for methods to work. The type doesn't care how you use the function, but that's how functions work.
[19:08:10] <rendar> Yhg1s, oh, the type, you mean the "function" type?
[19:08:32] <Yhg1s> yes. __*__ methods are defined on the type. The class.
[19:09:25] <rendar> so, i should think of `class function: ... def __get__(...` somewhere in the code, even if it doesn't exist like that because of C optimizations?
[19:09:44] <Yhg1s> rendar: yes, the function type has a __get__ method.

[19:10:01] <rendar> i see
[19:10:39] <rendar> Yhg1s, another thing, why did you say that usually descriptors are callable if they usually aren't since you don't implement __call__ inside a descriptor?
[19:11:08] <Cheaterman> If I can write GUI apps using async idioms, I guess I should? Sorry, intentionally vague question, haha... I'm about to write a new little SDK for an API I made (amusingly Flask, not FastAPI, but I'll get there too) and I figured I'd write it in async, but the problem I'm having is that despite my original question, I'll probably have some synchronous GUI apps
[19:11:18] <Yhg1s> rendar: because *all functions are descriptors*, and functions *are* callable.
[19:11:35] <rendar> Yhg1s, ok, i see now
[19:11:44] <Yhg1s> rendar: so just from that you can see there are a lot of descriptors that are callable. Very likely the vast majority of descriptors in your program, and possibly even the only ones.
[19:11:50] <Cheaterman> Ignoring (again, intentionally) trio's guest mode, should I simply run an event loop on its own thread for those cases?

[19:12:58] <Cheaterman> rendar: it does, but I have apps coded on top of it
[19:13:01] <Yhg1s> Cheaterman: they are, by nature, event driven frameworks.
[19:13:07] <Cheaterman> those apps are usually not written in async fashion so far
[19:13:42] <rendar> Cheaterman, i think your framework should support classic python loop and asyncio loop
[19:13:49] <Cheaterman> Yhg1s: I mean async as in using an async event loop and coroutines, which Kivy doesn't by default (although it can run inside an event loop, it doesn't use async idioms otherwise)

[19:15:04] <rendar> i see
[19:15:10] <rendar> so what is the problem?
[19:15:23] <Cheaterman> although I suppose conceptually it should be as easy as replacing a single function code, in practice those apps might be very complex and have plenty caveats
[19:15:28] <rendar> the old apps coded on top of this which uses sync methods won't use async event loop
[19:16:06] <Cheaterman> rendar: Mostly a question - should I write my SDK thingy using async idioms, and if so, should I just create an event loop in a separate thread to run it from otherwise blocking apps?
[19:17:05] <Cheaterman> Or in short, will my fancy new async SDK be compatible with my old blocking apps with minimum hassle
[19:17:08] <rendar> Cheaterman, if i were you, i'd have kivy (the classic old library) and asynckivy (the new one supporting asyncio), and if someone who coded a very big app wants async and coroutines, will do the porting, otherwise it will use old fashioned kivy

[19:18:49] <Cheaterman> I'm asking about the SDK I'm writing, if I'm trying to use it from old apps that aren't otherwise using an async event loop, should I make a threaded event loop or port the app? AIUI you're saying I should port the app
[19:18:50] <rendar> Cheaterman, ok, far enough, but i don't know if that's possible having it with minimum hassle
[19:19:24] <Cheaterman> rendar: I've been running event loops in threads successfully, I'm just not sure if it's a good approach at all, or if it's frowned upon for some reason
[19:19:27] <rendar> i'd port the app, threaded event loop is not a good idea
[19:19:36] <Cheaterman> and/or if there's a better way to use my async SDK from sync land
[19:19:49] <Cheaterman> and/or if I should simply not write my SDK in an async fashion in the first place, possibly
[19:19:59] <Cheaterman> rendar: I see, thanks
[19:20:03] <rendar> you use async stuff to not have to deal with threads, basically, that the *purpose*
[19:20:09] <Cheaterman> Totally agreed

[19:24:53] <Cheaterman> So the way I see it, I should 1°) try to simply run my current Kivy apps inside trio and see if they work as-is, 2°) potentially rewrite the threaded parts (where applicable) to use coroutines, and 3°) make my magic SDK pure async?
[19:25:07] <Cheaterman> rendar: Isn't that literally the opposite of async?
[19:25:14] <Cheaterman> async is all about coroutines and non-blocking calls?

[19:25:39] <Cheaterman> 1/2/3 were steps :-) not separate options
[19:26:04] <Cheaterman> rendar: but that's my point, these functions *are* blocking
[19:26:26] <rendar> Cheaterman, multithreading = you have a restaurant and every threads does something, who cooks, who wait orders and so on, with async stuff you have a restaurant with only *one* employee who cooks while waiting orders, takes orders while spaghetti are cooking.. and so on
