[00:15:55] <ioxzev1z> oic, ##altcoins for currency
[00:16:21] <ioxzev1z> Lol ##altcoins is empty
[00:16:26] <ioxzev1z> though it was a real channel
[00:16:29] <ioxzev1z> *thought
[00:17:16] <ioxzev1z> AsenMx, how did you lose all your money from two days of trading?
[00:17:37] <ioxzev1z> Did you buy at normal price and the entire currency dropped to 0 in two days?
[00:17:41] <AsenMx> ioxzev1z, traded Beta panic sold multiple times :D 
[00:18:24] <ms7821> cryptocurrency is actually off-topic
[00:18:29] <riv> never sell at a loss
[00:19:15] <ioxzev1z> iirc someone bought a pizza for 100k bitcoin
[00:19:31] <ms7821> 10k
[00:20:09] <AsenMx> riv, and what to do when it drops 1000%? and i bought at ATH? 
[00:20:26] <ms7821> AsenMx, seriously take the trading crap elsewhere
[00:20:43] <AsenMx> okay :P 
[00:20:48] <ms7821> thanks
[00:21:40] <AsenMx> no problems, the chat was quite dead so decided to have something to talk about ... sorry that i bothers you
[00:22:20] <ioxzev1z> ms7821, but muh interest
[00:22:26] <ms7821> it's just that if people see trading chat they start taking over and then get upset when people want them to stop

[05:56:18] <Hash> How is cryptananlysis still a thing?
[05:56:37] <Hash> Obviously the current standard encryption algorithms and ciphers are unbreakable until you get to quantum computing.
[05:56:46] <Hash> Which is still a good long time away
[05:56:59] <Hash> How is cryptananlysis still possible?
[05:58:57] <ericonr> The algorithms we currently use may be safe, but I'm pretty sure a bunch of bad ones were weeded out with cryptanalysis
[05:59:04] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[05:59:49] <ericonr> Also, I'm not sure what kind of cryptanalysis attack you mean here
[06:01:26] <Hash> I didn't know there were different kinds
[06:01:56] <Hash> Oh ok, that's a good point about weeding out.
[06:02:04] <rk4> why are our current algorithms obviously unbreakable until you get to quantum computing?
[06:02:13] <int-e> "obviously unrbeakable" is a joke
[06:02:14] <Hash> But now, post RSA and AES, is it still possible? 
[06:02:37] <Hash> How is it a joke? There does not exist enough computing power on the planet to do that in any feasible time. 
[06:02:45] <rk4> int-e: ah fair...it's hard to seperate satire from clueless! :(
[06:02:54] <int-e> the reality is "we tried really, really hard to break it but so far to no avail; we can only break reduced versions of the cipher with n/2 rounds instead of n"
[06:03:14] <Hash> hmm
[06:03:15] <int-e> And the way that position is supported is by continuing to try.
[06:03:22] <Hash> Sure
[06:03:28] <int-e> AKA doing cryptanalysis.
[06:03:38] <Hash> But it is also accurate to say that they will remain unbreakable for quite some time.
[06:03:44] <rk4> and the attacks have been getting better every year, as they will continue to
[06:03:46] <int-e> rk4: I'm not sure whether it was intended as a joke :P
[06:04:21] <Hash> if they are not obviously unbreakable, then please do so and probably win a nobel prize.
[06:04:22] <rk4> what you've just done Hash is predict the future ;)

[06:04:51] <int-e> Hash: there's a crucial difference between "obviously unbreakable" and "not obviously breakable"
[06:05:14] <rk4> how long have you been involved with cryptography Hash, out of curiousity
[06:05:53] <rk4> why do you think now is the point in time where we've solved it
[06:06:03] <rk4> why wasn't it 20 years ago that we were making unbreakable ciphers
[06:06:27] <rk4> [...i know, plenty still are unbroken :), but some are broken...]
[06:06:37] <int-e> So no, I'm not going to break, say, Chacha20 anytime soon; I'm not going to accidentally find a clever approach that experts in cryptanalysis haven't already thought of.
[06:07:13] <int-e> That doesn't mean I want the experts to stop trying and new people to study to become the next generation of experts.
[06:07:40] <int-e> (hmm, the negations got a bit messed up there)
[06:09:08] <SymbioticFemale> Hash: let me give you a better way to understand the sad state of open source crypto: the libsodium project publically thanks 3 financial backers: One of them donated $100 for server expenses, one company donated a raspberry pi, and one company sponsored an analysis.
[06:10:19] <Hash> SymbioticFemale: that does not further my understanding at all.
[06:10:23] <int-e> I shudder to imagine the state of crypto if we had stopped doing cryptanalysis 4 years ago.
[06:10:30] <Hash> What does financial support have to do with this?
[06:10:44] <Hash> Who said stopped doing it or suggesting we stop?
[06:10:59] <int-e> Hash: you asked "How is cryptananlysis still a thing?"
[06:11:02] <SymbioticFemale> "obviously unbreakable" < lol
[06:11:07] <Hash> Yes. How is it is still a thing?
[06:11:10] <Hash> What exactly is going on?
[06:11:11] <int-e> If that's not a suggestion to stop doing cryptanalysis I don't know what it is.
[06:11:25] <Hash> Then you have a very terrible reading/comprehension and I suggest improving your English skills.

[07:11:54] <Hash> Perhaps you've been conditioned by media to believe a certain phrasing means a certain thing.
[07:11:59] <Hash> That's also possible.
[07:12:28] <Hash> Last Week Tonight. So according to your psychological and cultural conditioning through mass media, I can understand why you'd think that.
[07:12:38] <rk4> so just so we're clear, is this your question: "How do people approach attacking modern ciphers?"

[07:13:27] <rk4> yes, but we operate at different wavelengths ;)
[07:14:08] <Hash> I forgot Americans and most Western people who speak English as their first langauge take it as a granted and are conditioned for a linquistic auto pilot behavior.
[07:14:31] <Hash> I'm not sure what to do about it. All I can say is, before you decide to lambast someone, gather enough intel to make sure your lambasting is called for.
[07:14:53] <rk4> instead of writing "no" or "yes", you took the higher effort way of continuing our contention over communication styles
[07:15:24] <Hash> Correct.

Either my code is bad or there are some issues with buffers not being cleared somewhere in libsodium or ???

[09:47:51] <Wulf> SymbioticFemale: and for generating onion addresses you don't need x25519 at all?
[09:49:26] <SymbioticFemale> Wulf: one is for signing (ed) and one is for encryption (x). a signing key can be converted to an encryption key, which i do successfully with a freshly generated (libsodium) ed25519 keypair. however, when i try to convert a tor generated ed25519 keypair, the conversion results are not as expected.
[09:50:54] <SymbioticFemale> basically, with a tor generated ed25519 keypair, the converted public key != the public key generated from the converted secret key. with the libsodium keypair (try yourself with -b flag), this isn't an issue.

[17:27:50] <ms7821> SymbioticFemale: I'm finally awake and gave it a quick look. The good news is that if you take the output of -b and put it into -c it fails, so it's not to do with the onion logic
[17:28:43] *** Joins: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy)
[17:30:00] <SymbioticFemale> the output of -b is a x25519 keypair, whereas the input of -c is a ed25519 keypair
[17:30:21] <SymbioticFemale> thats presumably why it failed on you
[17:30:22] <ms7821> I made it log out both
[17:30:28] <SymbioticFemale> hmm
[17:30:37] <ms7821> and I think the iss ue might be because crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES is not 32
[17:33:07] <ms7821> yep, replacing the 32s with the appropriate of crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES and crypto_sign_PUBLICKEYBYTES fixes it

[18:54:18] <SymbioticFemale> :|
[18:54:54] <river> what are you working on?
[18:57:24] <ms7821> the secret key generation is pretty straightforward for libsodium https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/6d56607/src/libsodium/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10/keypair.c#L70
[18:57:56] <ms7821> but I don't have a clue what the PK one is doing or why it should ever work

[18:59:18] <ms7821> which is weird because all it's doing is https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/6d56607/src/libsodium/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10/keypair.c#L23

[19:11:14] <ms7821> crypto_sign_ed25519_seed_keypair misleadingly derives the PK from sha512(SK), not SK directly
[19:11:53] <SymbioticFemale> what?
[19:11:56] <SymbioticFemale> it does not
[19:12:08] <SymbioticFemale> no, that's just expansion of the seed
[19:12:42] <ms7821> and crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519 generates an SK as sha512(original_SK), so calling crypto_scalarmult_base on it will give you the same result as the keypair

[19:33:38] <ms7821> SymbioticFemale: I *think*, if you want to use the onion keys for cryptobox stuff, you're safe doing this instead of what you currently have:

[19:34:34] <ms7821> i.e. using the pre-hashed value as the SK, as crypto_sign_keypair does
[19:35:08] <ms7821> beats me why crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519 does what it does though
[19:36:17] *** Joins: tusko (~yeurt@copyfree/advocate/tusko)
[19:36:46] <SymbioticFemale> amazing
[19:37:25] <SymbioticFemale> test_keys(x25519_pk_convert,ed25519_sk); totally works around the issue and solves my problem
[19:39:56] <ms7821> when I say safe, I'm not considering cross-protocol attacks (e.g. where tor happens to perform the same operations in response to chosen data)
[19:40:29] <ms7821> you might want to derive a completely new seed/SK using a keyed hash (or just a constant unique prefix)
[19:41:00] <ms7821> though I guess that won't work if you want people to sign messages to you from your onion address
[19:41:11] <SymbioticFemale> ^
[19:41:55] <SymbioticFemale> the reason i spent a whole week on this rather than just generating new keys and passing them is because i want exactly that
[19:42:23] <ms7821> btw the base32 code you're using actually seems to expect nul-terminated input so you might want to find a better library for that
[19:42:37] <ms7821> (sometimes you'll see -b returns shorter SKs)
[19:42:54] <SymbioticFemale> ah, so *that* is why they are sometimes shorter
[19:43:24] <SymbioticFemale> i had a hard enough time finding this library. base64 functions are a dime a dozen but base32 is a rarity
[19:44:09] <ms7821> working in python or something might be an idea
[19:44:42] <SymbioticFemale> the intended use for these x25519 keys is actually for "V3Auth" / tor onion service client authentication

[22:35:50] <maroon> i did the instructions by libera on making an SASL certificate using openssl RSA/sha256, and when i display the detail of the cert, i see it having a 4096 bit modulus 'n', and the 512 bytes next to "Signature Algorithm" i assume is the 'd' parameter - but when i do (dummy-message^65537 mod n -> ciphertext, then do (ciphertext^d mod n) it doesn't go back to the original dummy message

[22:36:13] <maroon> is that last string of the certificate supposed to be the 'd', or something else?

[23:01:15] <mouseghost> SymbioticFemale, whats that file
[23:03:03] <riv> viruse
[23:04:34] <SymbioticFemale> mouseghost: a successor to TorChat/Ricochet/AnonymousMessenger, where messages are sent over unidirectional connections to peer v3 onions, with v3 authentication. metadata safe ; the .onion your friend gives you only exists until the first handshake. after the first handshake, a new .onion is generated and the old one is destroyed.
[23:04:54] <mouseghost> hmmm
[23:06:50] <SymbioticFemale> in addition, there are no connections maintained. when you want to send a message, you connect and send, then the connection breaks.  it means that you can't check whether your friends are online without messaging them, which is inconvenient, but it prevents compromised / malicious  peers from correlating your online times. and, of course, all files (onion addresses, peer nicknames, chat records, 
[23:06:56] <SymbioticFemale> private keys) are encrypted

[23:22:32] <SymbioticFemale> name isn't released yet. don't want someone domain squatting me. for the time being, it has a working title of SymChat
[23:26:12] <maroon> ok i see there was another mime in the file next to the cert, and it had the private key in it, but when i used that pem's "private exponent" as the 'd', it still didnt decrypt an arbitrary message encrypted with (m^65537 mod modulus)
