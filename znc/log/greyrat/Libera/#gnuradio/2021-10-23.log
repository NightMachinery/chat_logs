[21:40:31] <nickoe> Wow maint-3.8 is just not buildable  at all :/
[21:45:45] <nickoe> By they way did gr-iio ever get merged?
[21:53:29] <tnt> nickoe: maint stands for "needs maintenance" :)
[21:55:18] <nickoe> Is ci.gnuradio.org/buildbot comming back or what is the situation?
[22:03:17] <DerekKozel[m]> CI is done using GitHub actions. What problem do you have with maint-3.8?
[22:03:36] <funkylab[m]> nickoe: it was merged, see the release notes :)
[22:03:48] <DerekKozel[m]> We do have a maintainer for the maint 3.8 and 3.9 branches too
[22:04:11] <funkylab[m]> we have maint-3.8 being default-buildable on basically all modern platforms that we can lay a hand on, maybe for except of slackware :)
[22:04:54] <JoshMorman[m]> <nickoe> "By they way did gr-iio ever..." <- Gr-iio is merged on master but hasnt gone into a release yet
[22:05:17] <nickoe> JoshMorman, is it intended to be merged for 3.9?
[22:06:04] <nickoe> Derek, about 3.8, first the qwt issue and then I got issues with some SWIG stuff not being happy
[22:06:05] <JoshMorman[m]> No for 3.10. Targeting RC before the end of the year
[22:06:20] <nickoe> @Derek, https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/4956#issuecomment-950191780
[22:06:24] <nickoe> ok

[22:07:37] <nickoe> Specifically tyhe siwg errors looks like
[22:07:38] <nickoe> https://dpaste.com/38LZKBV8S
[22:08:46] <funkylab[m]> ah, that's typically caused by swig finding older headers on the system. Swig is a bit stubborn and doesn't listen to our include paths exclusively.
[22:09:01] <nickoe> mmm older headers?
[22:10:32] <funkylab[m]> yes, the most common reason for swig complaining about symbols that it can't find is that we ask swig to wrap "gnuradio/something/header.h" from the source tree that we're currently building. But if there is, say, already a "/usr/include/gnuradio/something/header.h" on your system, then SWIG picks that one on occassion
[22:10:44] <funkylab[m]> is that possibly the case for you?
[22:10:50] <nickoe> I only have local/swig 4.0.2-2 installed
[22:11:14] <funkylab[m]> ah, so no prior GNU Radio installations?
[22:11:18] <nickoe> I have gnuradio installed in the system as well yes
[22:11:30] <nickoe> I have gnuradio from the package manager
[22:12:17] <funkylab[m]> ah, can you temporarily uninstall that, clean your build folder and retry? As said, I've seen SWIG misbehave that way, and I don't think we've found a way stopping SWIG from doing that...
[22:14:16] <nickoe> Ok, I can try that.
[22:15:01] <funkylab[m]> thanks!
[22:20:35] <nickoe> Then it builds just fine.
[22:21:00] <nickoe> Can I add some options via cmake to fix this issue?
[22:21:33] <funkylab[m]> sadly, no. It's a SWIG bug for all I know.
[22:22:14] <funkylab[m]> as said, we never figured out how to make SWIG use our in-tree includes instead of system includes
[22:24:57] <nickoe> :(

[23:20:40] <Guest2726> I am trying to write a python block. I am taking output from a 512 point FFT block.  I have to store them in a array. So I am thinking of taking 2D_Array approach. So array size will be(512,1). This is for first steam of 512 point FFT. In the 2nd iteration, I have to store 512 points of an FFT again. So total 15 times iteration, I am doing. After
[23:20:41] <Guest2726> that i am trying to sum only the first row values of each iteration(15) and average them.  
[23:20:57] <Guest2726> a = []
[23:20:58] <Guest2726> fft_len = 512  # This line is only for testing purposes, in real script this line will not be there
[23:20:58] <Guest2726> for i in range(0, fft_len): 
[23:20:59] <Guest2726>     a.append(i) 
[23:20:59] <Guest2726> a_a = np.array(a)
[23:21:00] <Guest2726> a_a = a_a.reshape(512,1)
[23:21:00] <Guest2726> print(a_a)
[23:21:46] <Guest2726> any suggestions on how take this approach? 
[23:22:06] <Guest2726> the code snippet, works for one iteration. 
[23:22:16] <Guest2726> I want to do this 15 times. 
[23:23:26] <Guest2726> So, basically it would be like writing to a column wise(rows=512, and column=1) writing to a excel file. And for every iteration we shift to next column.,
