[10:21:29] <tsujp> Otherwise I'm essentially re-implementing the controller in this thing, you know?
[10:21:40] <jmer> tsujp: sounds like your controller is too "fat"
[10:21:44] <jmer> I think biberu has a point

[10:39:54] *** Joins: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco)
[10:40:57] <tsujp> I'll have a go at that if this doesn't work
[10:42:36] <jmer> tsujp: it's not about working or not, it's about writing maintainable code that won't trigger too many "WTF" moments for you and your colleagues in the future ;)
[10:42:58] <tsujp> Trying to figure out how to call `.Add` to a `JsonPatchDocument<UpdateProperties>()`, it has some parameter typing I do not understand. For a patch document of that type Add expects `Expression<Func<TModel, IList<TProp>>> path, TProp value, int position)`
[10:43:25] <tsujp> I mean I didn't write this controller, and a previous equivalent-ish thing written by someone else uses an HttpClient to just hardcode call a controllers URL which I don't want to do
[10:45:32] <jmer> tsujp: What's wrong with that?
[10:45:59] <jmer> If the route changes you need to redeploy the code anyways
[10:46:18] <tsujp> Mentioned above controller route might change in the future, thus hardcoding with HttpClient will break. Is it not just better to call the controller method directly?
[10:46:55] <jmer> tsujp: I would probably go for consistency rather than oen method that might be slighly better. I think it's better to spend your time on making those routes live only one place instead.
[10:47:26] <tsujp> Okay I'll use the HttpClient directly then
[10:47:29] <jmer> either you change it all to use one approach :P
[10:47:41] <jmer> or you use the allready exisiting approach even though it might not be perfect.
[10:49:04] <jmer> tsujp: but generally I still think biberu's comment has merit :P
[10:49:12] <jmer> I mean, in general.
[10:49:17] <jmer> it might not be feasable to refactor now
[10:49:34] <jmer> but then create a task for the future and put it in the backlog so you don't forget
[10:54:09] <tsujp> Gotcha
[10:54:50] <tsujp> Yeah in general I agree about keeping the controllers as lean as sanely possible but if I take on the job of refactoring it now without consulting the team etc it's kind of just me making a decision without any input that affects them all
[10:55:01] <tsujp> (which I have done in the past for good intentions but need to keep myself from doing in future)
[10:55:30] <tsujp> hence my desire for the direct method call. But yeah noted on what you said, I'll just do the HttpClient and make a ticket otherwise that spawns the discussion around a possible refactor in this area
[10:55:52] <jmer> tsujp: Yes. Also props for thinking about your teammates ;)
[10:59:13] <Nasp> tsujp: what do you mean by calling the controller directly?
[11:07:03] <jmer> Has anyone moved an azure app service to a container?
[11:07:52] <jmer> More detail; I'm considdering using an Azure App Service directly, to host a REST service, but I know that in the future we will be getting Redhat Openshift.
[11:08:17] <jmer> You can host containers on an Azure App Service nowadays... So I am wondering if I should spend some time setting up the container now or if it can wait.
[11:08:45] <jmer> I don't have practical experience with Docker or the likes so it would require a bit of effort from my side getting up to speed
[11:09:24] <tsujp> App Service is their thing which gives you some generic endpoint they manage the HTTPS and what not for, for you right?
[11:09:55] <tsujp> Regarding Docker, it's quite easy by itself unless you need to do some wacky networking at which point it depends on exactly what that is and how that interacts with App Service
[11:10:05] <jmer> tsujp: depends how you set it up, as I mentioned you can host Docker containser in an Azure App Service today. But you can also just use it as a 100% managed service (you just deploy your code and don't think too much about it)
[11:10:08] <tsujp> What will the container be doing? Just a single one by itself etc?
[11:10:20] <jmer> heh there will be lots of wacky networking
[11:10:37] <jmer> there's a public frontend that will call Azure API Management  where the serivce will live...
[11:10:58] <tsujp> Oh, by wacky networking I mean between the containers in question
[11:11:01] <jmer> and we have a VPN connection to Azure
[11:11:07] <jmer> and some of thse services are hosted on premise
[11:13:00] <tsujp> I'm gonna bow out then, I don't know enough beyond it's existence regarding App Service

[13:02:55] <Voarge> I guess sort of a .ContinueWith() which is an actual yield return
[13:03:36] <Suchiman> Voarge: depending on if you're set on using IAsyncEnumerable or not, you can also just write Foo[] results = await Task.WhenAll(strs.Select(x => DoSomethingAsync(url)))
[13:03:50] <Suchiman> Voarge: await == ContinueWith
[13:06:35] <Voarge> Suchiman that's similar to what I'm doing already, but that just means that it only returns when *all* tasks have completed. Sure it eliminates the need for yield return and I return just a normal task, but if there's 10 total items in strs and 9 of them take 0.1 secs and one takes 10 seconds no item will be returned and evaluated by the caller
[13:06:35] <Voarge> until all tasks complete, which is 11 secs execution. By that time 9 of the tasks could have been processed and it could just be waiting for the last one

[14:15:57] <JakeSays> Suchiman: at the end of the cold war we downsized our military presence in europe, but we left behind the equipment in storage. there's hundreds of tanks, bradleys, missiles, etc. sitting on ice. activating them means making them war ready

[14:59:24] <bomb> MatthiasVance yeah so many propaganda from both sides. I'm still remaining neutral
[14:59:26] <blezz> nothing _requires_ npm. You can use yarn for example
[14:59:55] <JakeSays> does yarn create less of a shitpile than npm?
[15:00:00] <bomb> blezz that's unrealistic. node and npm are married couples
[15:00:17] <MatthiasVance> No open marriage?
[15:00:20] <JakeSays> bomb: i've used node w/o npm many times
[15:00:22] <blezz> I don't use npm at all. Only yarn
[15:00:36] <JakeSays> yarn probably uses npm
[15:00:51] <bomb> JakeSays best alternative (in the future) will be something written by Node's creator in Rust. API compatible with Node, but without all the NPM crap
[15:01:23] <bomb> JakeSays it's not ready, people say, but here's the link:  https://deno.land/
[15:01:23] <JakeSays> bomb: well, given that node's creator gave us node..

[20:02:57] <GunArm> anyone know of compatibility issues with .net framework 4.x and modern apache/openssl?
[20:03:52] <GunArm> we upgraded our fairly old apache (we had to use fips that held us back in the past and now that doesn't exist) and now no https requests to proxied links work
[20:04:02] <GunArm> i stripped the code down to the most basic http post
[20:04:30] <GunArm> works on old apache, fails on new apache, build the code to dotnet core, it works on new apache
[20:04:59] <GunArm> same hand full of lines of code for an httpclient request work on dotnet core and fail on .net framework
[20:05:07] <canton7> Define "fails"
[20:05:43] <lz_> error code 0
[20:06:29] <GunArm> apache gets the request, (gets fuzzy here) starts trying to redirect the request to the proxy, the proxy (like plackup or any socket listener on a port the proxy redirects to) never receives the post data, eventually apache times out the background request
[20:06:56] <GunArm> it actually is sortof exploitable, if anyone with .net framework makes an request to a proxied link, it locks up the background worker
[20:07:10] <GunArm> for the timeout period

[20:10:06] <GunArm> the best way I've been able to speculatively explain what I'm seeing is that, .net 4 (in combo with schannel?) has some implementation of a TLS handshake, which maybe apache/openssl didn't exactly like but tolerated, and then apache "fixed" it so it is incapable of talking to that .net tls communication.  and then dotnet fixed it so it would work on more "strict" apache/openssl
[20:10:42] <GunArm> but leaving a situation where .net 4.x is incapable of https on a proxied endpoint on modern apache
[20:11:46] <GunArm> this is all bizarre and sounds like nonsense but it's very clear cut that a simple https to a proxied link works on old apache, locks up new apache, the same code rebuilt on core works on new apache
[20:12:37] <GunArm> it has to be specifically a confluence of 1. non-core .net    2. https   3. proxied endpoint   4.  modern apache
[20:13:28] <GunArm> the strangest thing is that I have not found anyone else talking about it, although the confluence of those 4 things is very specific (although not exactly obscure)

[20:57:51] * bomb runs
[20:57:56] <_genuser_> DevJohnC horribly outdated!
[20:58:16] <jmer> I don't remember much about the ryzens so I odn't know how many cores those have but I just assume you do DevJohnC  :D
[20:58:26] <DevJohnC> _genuser_, well in the next 2 months or so it'll be upgraded to a 11th or 12th gen i9
[20:58:35] <DevJohnC> jmer, it's 8 core
[20:58:37] <bomb> even my first gen Ryzen 1700 ain't no bottleneck
[20:58:40] <jmer> nice
[20:58:49] <bomb> those are fast motherfuckers
[20:59:21] <_genuser_> DevJohnC nice! And my comment was just a joke about how fast these things go out of date. I have a Ryzen 3900 and I haven't even used it, because I keep using my win7 machine.
[20:59:27] <DevJohnC> the Ryzen is actually slated to be my new NAS in the future
[20:59:48] <_genuser_> DevJohnC home spun NAS?
[21:00:02] <DevJohnC> yeah
[21:00:20] <bomb> _genuser_ so you keep your Ryzen in the box? Win7 doesn't support Ryzens
[21:01:04] <_genuser_> DevJohnC awesome! I have an older AMD E1-2100 APU serving as a NAS. Gentoo/Raid1 on a mini-itx. Very minimal. With Samba on top for win access.
[21:01:38] <jmer> _genuser_: it makes no sense to have TWO standups...
[21:01:47] <DevJohnC> I'm probably going to install TrueNAS or FreeNAS or something
[21:01:47] <jmer> _genuser_: how many people are on your team?
[21:01:49] <_genuser_> bomb pretty much in a box. I have a Kubuntu setup on it, with win10 running in a VM over pci-passthrough to a second GPU. But hard to retire the win7 machine and move it out of the desk and start using the new one.
[21:02:05] <_genuser_> jmer hehe, not many. just 15 or so.
[21:02:27] <_genuser_> jmer and not all attend. The point I think is one of the guys is starting to take a "leadership" role and running his own standup.
[21:02:43] <jmer> _genuser_: sounds like pretty bad leadership imho
[21:02:52] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[21:02:58] <jmer> also 15 people is a bit too much... "two pizza teams" the saying goes :P
[21:03:09] <_genuser_> DevJohnC I tried FreeNAS. If I remember correctly it is openbsd based. In teh end, I went with Gentoo because I've run it for 15years and I'm "comfortable" with how uncomfortable it can be to fix sometimes.
[21:03:12] <jmer> that's 1min. for each in a 15 min standup
[21:03:42] <_genuser_> jmer that's 15 people including some customer stakeholders. Not necessarily working on code stuff. So they're there if someone has a question.

[22:09:57] <bomb> YOLO pattern
[22:09:59] <Cecen_> Standups are concerning. 'What are you doing today? The exact thing you said you were going to do during planning? Cool.'
[22:10:30] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[22:10:39] <jmer> Cecen_: It's a misconception it's a status reporting meeting.
[22:10:46] <jmer> Cecen_: it's coordination between the devs
[22:10:57] <Cecen_> Coordination between devs is constant unless your team is dysfunctional
[22:11:04] <jmer> Cecen_: to a degree.
[22:11:09] <MichaelLong> it is boring AF
[22:11:56] <jmer> Cecen_: just because you spend 5-10 min in the morning to find out if people are stuck or the need help navigating the organizational structure doesn't mean you can't talk during the day

[22:15:05] *** Quits: ezio (~ezio@user/ezio) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:15:06] <jmer> Nasp: it's a priority.
[22:15:34] <Cecen_> It's literally a *meeting* with the express purpose of establishing that you *have a problem* without offering any sort of solution. It is by definition useless. If you have a problem or are blocked, you reach out when it happens.
[22:15:49] <jmer> Cecen_: It's not always that simple
[22:16:08] <Cecen_> There are also crazy new inventions like, you know, Slack channels where you can broadcast your distress to a wide audience without needing a meeting
[22:17:41] <jmer> Cecen_: also the standup is not ONLY for communicating problems or blockers.
[22:18:19] <jmer> Cecen_: you could easily coordinate that maybe someone is updating a database to a new version so X will be down (the development/test environment not production)
[22:18:47] <Cecen_> Do you really think that verbally giving notice of something being down and hoping everyone remembers is better than posting that in a Slack channel?
[22:18:53] <jmer> It can easily be valuable and useful if you use it right, but ofc. if you go into the meeting with a predertimned mindset that "this sucks" it will certainly suck
[22:19:12] <jmer> Cecen_: if you can't remember something I told you in the morning later that day I question what you are even doing in IT xD
[22:19:17] <bomb> standups sounds ableist
[22:19:21] <jmer> Then you should be in a protected home or something...
[22:20:04] <jmer> Not everyone reads slack at the same time.. Some people find it wildly annoying to have message notifications  at random times during the day
[22:21:00] <bomb> voicemails to the rescue. would make both jmer and cecen happy
[22:21:08] <jmer> bomb: absolutely not xD
[22:21:26] <jmer> Spending 5-10 min. in the morning with relevatn coordination can save you lots of annoying slack messages
[22:21:41] <jmer> (or teams or whatever communication platform the company uses)
[22:22:32] <Cecen_> So instead the solution is to interrupt everyone's day to verbally vomit some information because your neuroatypical team members curl up in a ball and hyperventilate when they get too many chat notifications, got it
[22:23:30] <jmer> Cecen_: It's not an interruption when it's a planned meeting. Random, drip fed, instant messages is though
[22:24:22] <jmer> Cecen_: have you even tried using scrum successfully because right now you sound like one of those people who's only seen it done wrong and then you think that's scrum xD
[22:24:45] <bomb> I'm with Cecen here
[22:25:31] <jmer> bomb: doesn't exactly improve his "position" xD
[22:25:41] <jmer> I would actually argue it kinda makes it worse!!!
