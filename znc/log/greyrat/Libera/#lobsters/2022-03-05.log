[11:47:49] <rtpg> OK so like... google cloud storage/S3 etc charge by the gigabyte for downloads of assets, and at pretty big numbers! But loads of VPS offerings offer "unlimited bandwidth". What gives? Is there a catch here, if you don't really care about operational issues from serving files from a VPS?
[11:48:25] <rtpg> Like if I have big files but that wwon't be downloaded super heavily, could I just get away with a random server basically anywhere and not worry about spiking bills in case of traffic spikes?

[12:19:16] <rwb> rtpg: sure, i think the point of s3 is basically that you don't have to worry about setting up a storage API of your own and can just use an existing library to put files and be done with it
[12:19:27] <rwb> and also it has a bunch of ACL config etc.
[12:19:57] <rwb> basically it's a sophisticated object storage. if you don't need that then it's not worth using
[12:20:23] <rwb> we use it for daily encrypted backups of our database. costs us about $2/mo
[12:20:44] <rwb> since we don't have out transfer we only pay for about 300gb of storage
[12:21:14] *** Joins: southclaws (~AdminUser@212.82.91.46)
[12:21:30] <rwb> compared to the previous automated backup solution we used which was upwards of $1000/mo
[12:24:07] <rtpg> right so S3 sounds great for dealing with user-uploaded things or what you're describing, but things like "S3 for your own CDN" seem a bit... wasteful then? Like for your handful of files that you can upload during your deploy process?
[12:24:16] <rtpg> The calculus seems way off to me
[12:24:24] <rwb> oh your own CDN? probably
[12:24:31] <rwb> cloudfront is pretty nice to pair with s3
[12:24:59] <rwb> but that's amazon storage + amazon CDN
[12:25:32] <rtpg> "own CDN" here means "your JS files for your website"
[12:25:39] <rwb> hmm yeah it might be overkill
[12:25:59] <rwb> but then again serving from amazon servers will probably be faster than serving from your webserver
[12:26:05] <rwb> even without cloudfront

For gcs/s3 and similar, they are able to offer much higher bandwidth and, for their common use cases, it wouldn't be that useful to rate-limit them. They also distribute data geographically

[17:52:20] <pushcx> The 'stories' table has a 'merged_story_id' column where one story indicates it's merged into another. So there's an implicit unnamed concept of two kinds of story: one that's not merged or is the merge target, and one that's merged. And then every line of code needs to know these are different things. Quick list of bugs: https://gist.github.com/pushcx/63e7a3c7591e9eaa65ee77ad91e0d8bd

[23:25:25] <rwb> the best way to get an invitation is to know someone on the site irl. you could also post some presence like github or twitter. otherwise, just stick around in the chat for a while so people get to know you.
[23:25:28] <rwb> abgeo: ^
[23:37:21] <jazz> river: all devs need to be cognizant of the underlying db model... not sure why rails would be any different there. ActiveRecord just makes it easy to write forward/backward migrations for the schema

[23:48:06] <abgeo> Thanks @rwb. This is my GitHub profile: https://github.com/ABGEO
[23:48:07] <mockturtle> [ ABGEO - Overview ] - github.com
[23:51:18] <amir> I've been a user for more than eight years and still don't know how to invite someone :|
[23:52:36] <ngoldbaum> go to your settings page and scroll down
[23:52:57] <ngoldbaum> there’s a control to enter an email address and send an invite with an optional welcome message
[23:55:13] <amazigh`> abgeo: it is rare to see a github profile as good as yours
[23:56:36] <amazigh`> abgeo: a direct link to clockify would be nice in the repository goclockify

[23:56:49] <drobilla> The visitor counter straight out of 1994 really brings it home
[23:57:12] <amir> ngoldbaum: thanks
[23:57:46] <amir> abgeo: is the email address on your github profile suitable for the invitation?
[23:58:21] <abgeo> Thanks amazigh`. Unfortunately, I don't have much time for more input
[23:58:45] <abgeo> amir: you can invite me with this email: takalandzet@gmail.com
[23:58:55] <abgeo> Do not spam me :d
[23:59:21] <amazigh`> I am not logged in
[23:59:33] <amazigh`> I can't
