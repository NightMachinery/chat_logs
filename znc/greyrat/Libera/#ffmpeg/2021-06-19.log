[03:07:14] <StayHungry> BtbN: it is more complicated
[03:07:33] <StayHungry> i use two inputs (1.png and 2.png) to make gif animation with xfade filter
[03:07:47] <StayHungry> 1.png is gray, 2,png is color
[03:08:30] <furq> -lavfi "[0]format=rgb24[x];[x][1]xfade=..."

[03:09:18] <furq> if you're doing this more than once
[03:10:37] <StayHungry>  -pix_fmt rgb24 does not work here... let's try with filter...
[03:12:54] <StayHungry> it works, but resulting gif is huge
[03:13:33] <StayHungry> and if i convert gray png to rgb24 before using ffmpeg, resulting gif is small

[03:47:12] <znf> StayHungry, you realize the `duration` parameter is the crossfade duration, right?
[03:47:28] <StayHungry> yes
[03:47:41] <StayHungry> -t is the problematic to grasp here
[03:48:12] <StayHungry> first line in my eyes means hold 1.png for 9 seconds, then hold 2.png for 1 second
[03:48:48] <StayHungry> and while 1.png is on the screen (9s), fade it (for the same 9s) to 2.png
[03:49:00] <StayHungry> but it seems devs have another logic
[03:49:25] <StayHungry> because it works the described way when second -t is 10, not 1

[05:58:01] <MaurizioB> Hi. I'm trying to encode video coming from DroidCam (an Android app that streams the smartphone camera). While I'm able to capture the input, it seems like the stream has a variable framerate (around 30fps) even if the "nominal" fps is 25. The problem is that the output is played at 25fps (at least with mpv and vlc), so I'd like to understand how (or if) I can create a stream that respects the original timestamps.
[05:59:29] <MaurizioB> Note that if I directly play the stream from mpv, the timing is respected
[06:00:44] <MaurizioB> (or, at least, it seems like it does)

[06:13:30] <DeHackEd> lacking more details, it may depend on the file format. framerates may be fixed to certain times..
[06:20:29] <MaurizioB> DeHackEd: thanks, I'd like to add more details, but I'm not sure on what should be needed (or how to provide it).
[06:20:43] <MaurizioB> running ffprobe on the network address, the result is this: Stream #0:0: Video: mjpeg, yuvj420p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown), 640x480 [SAR 1:1 DAR 4:3], 25 tbr, 1200k tbn, 25 tbc
[06:21:24] <DeHackEd> what's the encapsulating file format? flv?
[06:21:30] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[06:24:29] <MaurizioB> DeHackEd: the source is mjpeg
[06:24:57] <MaurizioB> I've tried to encode in mp4 and mkv, but the result is the same
[06:25:52] <MaurizioB> I get a stream that is played at 25fps, but the content doesn't match (the app also adds the current timestamp on the video)
[06:26:23] <MaurizioB> if I force the framerate to 30, I get a *closer* result, but that's just a guess
[06:27:44] <furq> if you're encoding then -vsync vfr
[06:30:20] <MaurizioB> furq: I thought about that, but I'm not sure. The result would be to *drop* frames if they get an identical timestamp, but I don't want that: since it's a "security" video, I don't want to lose any frame

[18:26:11] <mickey> hello everyone, i downloaded some 6000 short files (live stream recording) and i used ffmpeg -strict -5 -safe 0 -loglevel error -stats -f concat -i listoffiles.txt -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -c copy "combined.mp4" to combine them into one file, however the length of the combined file doesn't match the actual length of the original stream
[18:27:05] <mickey> and because there are 2 streams that i need to put in pip mode eventually (only one of them has the audio), i have 2 combined files of 2 streams that are completely out of sync even though when watching it on the provider's site they shows up synced
[18:27:19] <mickey> any idea what might be causing this?

[18:31:06] <mickey> oddly, merely aligning the beginning/end of the two clips would still make it go out of sync after a short period

[18:42:28] <BtbN> You can't just concat-demux entirely unrelated streams like that, unless they have perfectly synced timestamps.

[18:45:30] <BtbN> I'd try to concat the individual streams, and then combine those resulting single files, while specifying proper offsets

[18:55:40] <mickey> it's 2 streams and i've concat them separately, and only then tried to pip them
[18:56:09] <mickey> like, 6000 files into stream1.mp4 and 6000 files into stream2.mp4, and then pip stream1 inside stream2, where the audio comes from only one of them
[18:56:26] <BtbN> That should generally be fine
[18:56:28] <mickey> (it's a recorded class where one stream is the teacher and the board, with audio, and the other is the presentation)
[18:56:47] <mickey> well, it's completely off when i do it... it shows fine on the university's website with a live player
[18:57:06] <BtbN> Well, it doesn't have much of a chance to desync when both feeds are live
[18:57:26] <BtbN> But if they use different framerates, and entirely unrelated timestamps, syncing that up can be a mess
