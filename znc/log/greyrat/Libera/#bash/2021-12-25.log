[00:00:05] <llua> but now you need a terminal, that isn't a terminal, yet is a terminal.
[00:01:06] <koollman> DPA: your initial diagnostic might be wrong. Find out why it's killed, maybe. starting it with 'nohup' should be sufficient, unless you have something like systemd session management killing them
[00:01:21] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[00:02:45] <DPA> I'll see, I think I just need to "( setsid --ctty command ) | cat", to set the "controlling terminal" to not actually a terminal.
[00:02:45] <DPA> koollman: It's not killed, it's stopped. That's part of what bash & terminals & control groups do together. (There are background groups and other stuff I don't fully grasp yet)
[00:02:47] <koollman> also you might just lack an actual process manager in it, so they get killed by your main process when it is used as an init process unexpectedly

[02:18:55] <Blondie101010> if you're sure the rule *ALWAYS* works, do that regex
[02:19:04] <greycat> I just googled tsp docker and got SO MANY conflicting results.

[02:19:26] <foul_owl> Don't worry about that too much, it's just a bash problem now, specifically string manipulation

[02:21:44] <tirnanog> can you give a concrete example of a job issued that is not subsequently reported in the way that you expect?
[02:22:24] <foul_owl> It possibly has a way to persist but I had to reboot quickly to get my system back so I just dumped stdout to a file
[02:22:46] <foul_owl> Ok so regex can do the trick? So something like sed?
[02:22:53] <tirnanog> because this is all extremely vague.
[02:22:54] <Blondie101010> he wants to double-quote what's in between --something
[02:23:06] <Blondie101010> so just do a regex for it
[02:24:29] <DPA> Is there some way to make tail follow all files in a directory, but also new ones created later on?
[02:24:54] <Blondie101010> that's not a bash question, but man tail includes '-F' which is close
[02:24:57] <foul_owl> I can see how to use sed to insert the first ", just 's/--foo=/--foo=\"/g'
[02:25:01] <tirnanog> honestly, this just sounds like a normal - and expected - consequence of quote removal. I'm not sure there's even a problem here.
[02:25:08] <tirnanog> but I can't even tell that because no test case is given.
[02:25:13] <Blondie101010> foul_owl: no that's poor
[02:25:23] <foul_owl> How would I go about inserting the second quote
[02:25:32] <foul_owl> Ahh sorry :( that's why i'm asking
[02:25:44] <Blondie101010> identify the part that needs to be quoted, not the other way around
[02:26:27] <foul_owl> The part that needs to be quoted is extremely variable unfortunately
[02:26:28] <kurahaupo> I would try something like sed 's/\(--[^ ]*=[^-]*\) /"\1" /g'
[02:27:47] <foul_owl> kurahaupo: that is close but it seems to quote some flags also ie: --bar becomes "--bar"
[02:27:50] <kurahaupo> foul_owl: If you're regenerating shell commands, it doesn't matter whether the opening quote goes before or after the --foo=
[02:28:17] <foul_owl> Ah I didn't know that! Awesome!
[02:28:25] <kurahaupo> foul_owl: extra quotes are still valid
[02:28:43] <tirnanog> this all just seems absurd anyway. it's completely normal that the shell you use to issue commands to tsp would perform quote removal. they won't show in the job list.
[02:28:55] *** Joins: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8)
[02:29:39] <tirnanog> if it's a problem, you could ask the tsp author to provide more control over the formatting so that one argument can be clearly disambiguated from another.
[02:29:42] <greycat> Am I seeing this right?  They've got a script which runs jobs, and then they've got a SECOND script which parses the output of "ps" or something ps-like to generate a THIRD script which is no longer a mirror image of the FIRST script, and they're confused as to why?
[02:29:46] <tirnanog> that's where such a change ought to be applied.
[02:29:56] <foul_owl> That's not it
[02:30:06] <foul_owl> This is a script to recover from a failure mode
[02:30:15] <foul_owl> It's a one off to recover a few hours of work
[02:30:39] <greycat> If my understanding is correct, skip the whole parsing-ps thing and just use the first script again.
[02:30:57] <foul_owl> docker shouldn't have crashed in the first place, or even if it did, it should allow the container to actually stop correctly and not produce orphaned processes that actually respond to kill -9
[02:31:30] <foul_owl> I'm not parsing ps, I'm parsing the output of "tsp" dumped before reboot
[02:31:44] <tirnanog> I called it.
[02:31:49] <foul_owl> "I'm forced to reboot for a very stupid kernel edge case? ok I gotta dump a list of my jobs first"
[02:31:52] <kurahaupo> foul_owl: the purpose of quotes is to stop the shell performing transformations (such as parameter expansion, word splitting, & globbing) on the enclosed text; the quotes themselves are always removed before the command is run.

[02:33:07] <tirnanog> rather than resorting to grotesque hacks, let's consider first whether tsp actually seralises the jobs in a way that's useful.
[02:33:22] <tirnanog> there's a chance that it might.

[02:44:25] <tirnanog> greycat: I've seen it be referred to as ts, tsp and task-spooler.
[02:44:40] <tirnanog> the debian package name is task-spooler.
[02:44:58] <tirnanog> and the binary name is tsp here.
[02:45:01] <greycat> I am somehow both terrified and also not at all surprised that a thing exists which purports to tackle the traveling salesman problem using Docker, and that this was the first Google result.

[14:55:32] <Laskolnyk> or script run from other script or script run in terminal session.
[14:56:13] <Laskolnyk> it's like that I would like to output some message if I know that human will read it.

[15:05:30] <nvz> there is also -t in the builtin test conditions
[15:05:45] <Laskolnyk> mhm, I will check… checked already many things like $- $SHLVL shopt login_shell  -t 0 and stuff but it does not work really.
[15:05:58] <nvz> if [ -t 1 ] is true then you're on a terminal
[15:07:15] <welder> the shopt -q works for login shell detection, but an interactive shell does not have to be a login shell
[15:07:20] <Laskolnyk> yes, terminal, that is correct, but how to know if script is being run not directly, but from other script = like for python you are checking the "if __name__ == '__main__'" ;-)
[15:07:22] <welder> $- seems to work OK
[15:07:50] <welder> if it's interactive it contains "i", otherwise not

[15:09:36] <Laskolnyk> heh, when I run it from shell it is also "hB" ;-)
[15:09:55] <welder> huh, it contains "himBHs" in my case
[15:10:22] <welder> what do you mean you run it from shell?
[15:10:32] <welder> echo $-, or bash -c 'echo $-' ?
[15:11:16] <welder> because if you are running a script like ./foobar.sh it's going to be noninteractive
[15:11:43] <Laskolnyk> yes, when I run echo $- it gives himBHs but if I put that in script and run it ./script it gives just "hB"
[15:12:01] <welder> that's the expeted behavior
[15:12:10] <Laskolnyk> so it is no go.
[15:12:28] <welder> you want to check if the script is accepting user input? it's different that being interactive
[15:12:39] <Laskolnyk> I need to distinguish in script is run like so: ./script and if it is run from another script/
[15:12:48] <welder> i may be wrong, but interactive means that you get the prompt an can do whatever you want
[15:13:09] <welder> hmmm

[17:38:17] <DPA> Is it possible to let the shell split a variable, but not glob it? I've something like   x="a b  c d e..."; read a b rest <<<"$x"; for x in $rest; do ...

[17:43:51] <DPA> Oh, nice. I didn't know this was possible. Thanks.

[17:46:38] <DPA> Interesting. So I could do stuff like "set -f; explicit_glob()( set +f; echo $1; );", and then I'd never have to worry about accidentally globbing stuff again.
[17:47:32] <ormaaj> that has other issues. You pretty much never need set -f.
[17:47:59] <DPA> Oh, wait no, my idea would break with spaces in variables...

[17:49:26] <DPA> I more often need no globbing than I need globbing.
[17:50:01] <tirnanog> but if you were to rely on set -f as a crutch, it would imply trivially rectifiable defects in your code, typically.
[17:50:22] <tirnanog> I can't see that's all that useful in bash, in particular.
[17:50:41] <ormaaj> And you don't get globbing unless you use globs so disabling it is redundant.
