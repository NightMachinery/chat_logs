[01:51:32] <gordonfish> Hi. I'm setting something up on a debian server (bullseye) that requires php-auth via apt install, but that package no longer exists
[01:51:51] <gordonfish> Is this part of something else now, or just no longer needed?
[01:52:51] <gordonfish> Has this been replaced by https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/php-auth-sasl ?

[02:06:10] <Blondie101010> are you trying to install a really old release?
[02:06:11] <Sammitch> why not set up a _current_ version that doesn't use mcrypt?
[02:06:21] <__adrian> ^
[02:06:32] <__adrian> **DON'T USE** mcrypt
[02:06:36] <Byteflux> Probably trying to install it from Debian packages (a very unwise idea)
[02:06:57] <__adrian> yeah, if you want to rely on standard repos, debian is close to the worst choice of os.
[02:07:20] *** Joins: ramblebamble (ramblebamb@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ramblebamble)
[02:07:22] <__adrian> well,,, i mean, relying on standard repos is kinda bad in general
[02:08:04] <Byteflux> OS package repositories in general are a poor choice for non-OS software
[02:08:08] <__adrian> (and i was thinking of centos when i said that. but debian also "prefers stability" over "supported versions")
[02:08:43] <Sammitch> installing PHP apps from the OS repo is about the least recommendable thing to do, IMO
[02:08:46] <Byteflux> Yep, that's one of the reasons I use Ubuntu, which is a much better experience when it comes to keeping up with modern packages, but even that is still a bad idea most of the time.
[02:09:49] <Byteflux> For PHP itself, Ondrej Sury (I believe he's also the person who maintains the official Debian packages?) has a PPA repository with modern builds. For actual PHP software, you're better off grabbing that from the vendor.
[02:10:01] <Sammitch> am I going to start another argument about EL/LTS distros baeing based entirely on the concept of "major versions set in stone at release"?
[02:10:13] <__adrian> via composer, if they have it set up
[02:10:48] <__adrian> Sammitch: also the idea that "if it's ok now, it's ok forever"
[02:12:02] <Sammitch> __adrian: I mean you still update, and the distro maintainers pointedly backport security fixes to maintain their guarantees. however they are not responsible for shitty admin choices that can frankly be made in ANY flavor of distro
[02:12:18] <Sammitch> eg: install and forget
[02:12:45] <__adrian> backporting is basically an empty/useless promise
[02:13:32] <Sammitch> bit I've had a fair few internet shouting matches with people with think that EL/LTS distros should do major version updates to core packages, despite that being counter to the explicitly stated goals of the distro
[02:13:58] <Sammitch> if you want newest version, you shouldn't be using EL/LTS. period.
[02:14:29] <Sammitch> you can bolt on the newest PHP's and such with 3rd party repos, _to a point_.
[02:14:43] <Byteflux> I use LTS distros for the distro, not for the apps they run.
[02:14:48] <__adrian> ^
[02:14:56] <gordonfish> Blondie101010, Sammitch: I haven't used Roundcube before and I didn't notice that is was that old. I was going to use the latest release; the guide even links to its github.
[02:15:00] <Sammitch> eg: if you want proper HTTP/2 support in Centos7 you're fairly hooped unless you want to recompile half the OS
[02:15:24] <Sammitch> *or use docker ;)
[02:16:58] <Byteflux> Right, you use CentOS or Ubuntu or whatever other LTS release because of the support and security update guarantees that come with system software, that still means a lot. Using Docker or installing software from outside the repos doesn't diminish that value.
[02:17:41] <Byteflux> Most of the time I couldn't care less what kernel version I'm running on a LTS distro.
[02:18:16] <Byteflux> Or what version of libpng or gnucoreutils is installed.
[02:20:04] <Sammitch> yeah much of the value of docker to me is the capacity to allow consolidating services with minimal overhead and without creating a "kitchen sink" machine that needs 4 different versions of some language/library install inside the same OS
[02:20:50] <Sammitch> and kernel version has mattered exxactly _once_ to me, and that was Centos 6's kernel not supporting overlayfs for docker
[02:21:20] <Byteflux> Yeah and most well known software has a sane versioning policy with regards to stability and security, just need to be aware that you're using a stable (and ideally long-term support) release
[02:22:11] <Byteflux> Docker makes that really easy.
[02:25:25] <Byteflux> Speaking of, Roundcube has an official Docker image for their latest stable 1.4.x release.
[02:26:07] <Sammitch> need to upgrade? edit the deployment to version+1. rollback? version-1. no more futzing with package manager and dependency hell

[04:04:25] <__adrian> installing php on your desktop OS is fine for messing around and just trying things out, but when you're ready to actually try out a project, don't do it locally. use a dev server (e.g., via docker).
[04:04:43] <__adrian> what packages you install depend on the OS. usually find the one that says "pdo" and that's it.
[04:05:24] <__adrian> the thing to make sure of is that you're getting a supported version of php - that means 8.0, or 7.4 at the absolute minimum (and only if there's some reason you can't do 8).

[07:12:10] <__adrian> fakuve: very absolutely not
[07:12:30] <__adrian> you should not try to learn the old ext/mysql functions, nor anything that tries to teach them to you.
[07:13:03] <__adrian> it's not simply different function names. mysql_* was a fundamentally flawed way of approaching everything.

[15:13:20] <brvadiraj46> php is mainly for generating dynamic html content?

[15:16:42] *** Joins: mIk3_08 (~Thunderbi@user/mik3-08/x-2852566)
[15:16:46] <brvadiraj46> If a file contains only PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script.
[15:16:59] <brvadiraj46> i don't think i understand above statement
[15:18:08] <brvadiraj46> does that mean if there are any white space or extra blank lines after closing tag, they will be output???
[15:18:46] <AllenJB> Many text editors default to adding a newline as the last thing in a text file when saving. This can cause issues because this whitespace can cause "output" to start, which interferes with things such as setting headers / cookies / sessions.
[15:20:07] <brvadiraj46> I am sorry.. I am just starting with php... can you please explain in simple terms
[15:20:21] <brvadiraj46> what does "output" to start mean
[15:21:04] <brvadiraj46> do you refer output as the not one generated bu php engine?
[15:22:12] <brvadiraj46> should i search on output buffering in internet to understand this concept?
[15:22:17] <brvadiraj46> LMC
[15:22:55] <Blondie101010> no what you refer to is not buffered
[15:23:01] <AllenJB> When you're dealing with HTTP,. you have the main body ( page / file) content (HTML, or could be other content such as an image), but before that you have headers, which are used for things like specifying the type of content in the main body and setting cookies. Headers MUST be sent before other content.
[15:23:45] *** Joins: bodiccea (~bodiccea@user/bodiccea)
[15:23:52] <AllenJB> You can use output buffering to "work around" this, but that means no content is sent to the client until _all_ the content is ready, which can cause issues with larger content (memory usage, delayed response to client)
[15:25:36] <Blondie101010> brentaarnold:  everything that is not inside <?php .. ?> tags is output as is
[15:25:37] <Blondie101010> that's it
[15:27:12] <brvadiraj46> is output buffering in effect when within php opening and closing tags
[15:30:36] <Blondie101010> no, it is a way to manage it manually
[15:31:00] <Blondie101010> you should not try to understand every concept if you have yet to grasp "output"

[15:57:47] <brvadiraj46> I understand something now
[15:58:41] <Blondie101010> read on the HTTP protocol
[15:59:13] <Blondie101010> the point is only that the headers must come first, so if you send junk by mistake, it may prevent the headers to be used
[16:00:29] <brvadiraj46> header is set when you use any html element or some blank lines... so when you include a php only file with some blank lines after closing tag , it tries to set the header again
[16:00:35] <brvadiraj46> resulting in error
[16:00:46] <brvadiraj46> I think thats what AllenJB  is talking about
[16:00:57] <Blondie101010> there is no "again"

[16:01:59] <Blondie101010> if you see something like that it means that you do something that tries to send a header after output has started, which will be ignored, as I just described
[16:02:11] <Blondie101010> it will only be part of the output
[16:02:37] <brvadiraj46> AllenJB, you there? any comments on what I described
[16:03:15] <brvadiraj46> According to Blondie101010 , it shouldn't be a problem
[16:03:40] <Blondie101010> no, you should learn to read!!!
[16:04:14] <Blondie101010> `?>` means leave `<?php` (php parsing) mode
[16:04:31] <Blondie101010> no need for that when you have nothing to output
[16:05:50] <brvadiraj46> Yeah, its unnecessary... but I thought you said, even if its there it shouldn't be a problem
[16:06:54] <Blondie101010> `?>` is not a problem by itself, but it's not needed and you were told not to use it if you don't need it

[16:08:16] <Blondie101010> if you put a single space after it, then it will prevent additional headers from being sent, preventing sessions from working, for example
[16:08:33] <brvadiraj46> I was just reading the documentation, they said if its php only file , it would create problem if  ?> is added in that file
[16:08:51] <brvadiraj46> its a php only file... no html is present in that
[16:09:03] <Blondie101010> so then what is unclear?
[16:09:16] <Blondie101010> don't put it if you don't need it
[16:09:47] <Blondie101010> but it certainly does not say that it causes problems
[16:09:48] <brvadiraj46> I was just trying to understand how it causes problems
[16:10:35] <Blondie101010> that's why I told you to read about the HTTP protocol
[16:11:09] <brvadiraj46> oh I got it... I got confused when AllenJB talked about some headers being resent
[16:11:15] <Blondie101010> but you probably don't need to at this point...  you're just pursuing what I suggested you skip for now and learn the basics first!
[16:11:42] <brvadiraj46> ok
[16:11:44] <Blondie101010> the space coming before headers would prevent the headers from being sent and processed
[16:12:14] <Blondie101010> HTTP headers are plain lines of text
[16:12:36] <brvadiraj46> ok sir
[16:14:04] <__adrian> !+?>
[16:14:04] <php-bot> The closing php tag `?>` is not for ending scripts; rather, it's for _beginning_ literal output.   it's like `echo "anything and everything until the next <?php tag";`  probably not what you meant.

[17:18:35] <AllenJB> I don't see how WordPress is involved - segfaults shouldn't ever be caused by PHP code issues (an infinitely recursive function is the only thing I can think of that might count, but still, that's horribly broken code).

[18:37:15] <__adrian> ideally, your web developers will be pretty good on managing themselves, so long as you provide a good ticketing system, regular standups, and keep everyone talking to each other.
[18:37:47] <__adrian> do you have managerial experience in any other industries / volunteer organizations / etc?
[18:39:50] <da_wunder> currently I have three 10-15minutes daily meetings with different people that are working on different projects - one of those is my main project atm and two others are just for consulting / support - because those teams haven't work with those two projects so much

[22:32:37] <harpia> As a workaround you could use the output buffering functions to capture and discard the output from curl_exec. I really don't know why CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER isn't working. In my own curl wrapper class I don't even use it.

[23:50:16] <fakuve> Hi guys , I will be firing some questions I'm back to study . I'm using `php7.3` in `Debian 10` . So mainly I see I got `/etc/php/7.3/cli/php.ini` and `/etc/php/7.3/apache2/php.ini` I reckon the former is for the `php` live interpreter of my linux , whereas the later is for `apache2` interpreter
[23:51:43] <fakuve> the guy in the tutorial is using `phpmyadmin` (that came with `XIMMP` I guess) , he is tweaking a config file that is called `config.inc.php` . I bet that is not in my system
[23:55:04] <__adrian> (a) don't use 7.3 to learn or for new code; it is security-only. use php 8, or 7.4 at the least. (b) to find your ini file, use phpinfo(), look for "loaded configuration file"
[23:55:19] <__adrian> <?php phpinfo(); // look at this webpage in your browser
[23:55:24] <__adrian> for the cli, use  php -i
