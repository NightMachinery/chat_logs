[00:20:13] <DrZl000> Hello!
[00:22:17] <DrZl000> Since  Sep 30, 2021 LetsEncrypt Root CA is expired. I've downloaded cacert.pem from curl.se now but the library still can not verify the peer (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER = true). The error with old cacert.pem was 
[00:22:18] <DrZl000> Debug: SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
[00:22:30] <DrZl000> With new one it's
[00:22:39] <DrZl000> Debug: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
[00:22:47] <DrZl000> An ideas how to fix it?
[00:23:21] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[00:27:18] <DrZl000> ISRG Root X1 is present in the file
[00:27:50] <bagder> "unable to get local issuer certificate" usually means the server didn't provide the intermediate cert
[00:27:53] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:31:14] <bagder> if that's the case, a test like https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ will tell you 
[00:31:25] <DrZl000> It happens when I connect to almost any website with LE certificate. I've found few and I'm looking deeper. Ok, I will check them
[00:32:29] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[00:32:54] <bagder> DrZl000: if you have a cacert bundle without the x3 cert in it, there should be very few LE problems anymore

[00:50:52] <DrZl000> That's really looks strange for me...
[00:51:11] <DrZl000> Now I compared 2 websites with LE certificate at ssllabs checker.
[00:51:27] <DrZl000> One is loaded successfully via libcurl
[00:51:48] <DrZl000> Certification Paths: only one, root CA is  	ISRG Root X1   (Self-signed)
[00:52:01] <DrZl000> The one that fails has 2 paths: 
[00:52:13] <DrZl000> 1st is same to  	ISRG Root X1 
[00:52:25] <DrZl000> 2nd goes to expired DST Root CA X3 
[00:53:08] <DrZl000> The curl.se itself shows both chains @ ssllabs
[00:53:55] <DrZl000> I have no such problems in my browsers, but I need to make the app that uses libcurl working with all websites
[00:53:58] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[00:54:06] <bagder> two chains is expected if you still have the x3 around
[00:54:08] <DrZl000> I will check few more domains....
[00:54:17] <bagder> DrZl000: what TLS library and version are you using?
[00:56:13] <DrZl000> libcurl 7.41.0 for Windows (dll); libeay32.dll 1.0.0o; ssleay32.dll 1.0.0o
[00:57:24] <bagder> I believe that old openssl doesn't deal with multiple paths proper
[00:58:26] <DrZl000> There is no expired X3 in cacert.pem. The second path should not be used?
[00:58:35] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[01:01:12] <bagder> I'm not really knowledgeable enough to explain that, sorry
[01:02:25] <DrZl000> omg. one of the famous news portals in our country has "Incorrect order, Extra certs" according to ssllabs. There are also 2 chains and same problem. OK. I will try to find newer Windows builds
[01:03:25] <DrZl000> However, this bundle was taken to one old project ~ 5 years ago and since that time used in few more projects by me. It worked with any Windows versions, but some newer either OpenSSL or Libcurl had compatibilit issues...
[01:04:40] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[01:04:47] <DrZl000> Thank you for help and fot this idea.
[01:05:32] <DrZl000> I have one more question if somebody knows the answer. How to exclude the second chain that runs to expired CA ? Just re-issue LE certificate?
[01:06:35] <DrZl000> no... I see the cert issued in October with 2 chains....

[12:37:59] <bagder> "If you were to guess, which of these components is installed in most devices world-wide?" ...
[12:38:47] <quinq> An acceleration pedal?
[12:38:58] <quinq> Oh sorry, I hadn't read the choices ^^

[12:39:23] <bagder> acceleration pedals aren't *that* common on devices outside of cars ...

[12:40:42] <earnestly> They don't
[12:40:58] <earnestly> I'd say zlib
[12:42:45] <quinq> bagder, isn't libz virtually a hard dependency to curl?
[12:43:05] <bagder> no... I know lots of users that don't use it with libcurl
[12:43:11] <bagder> especially smaller installs
[12:44:25] <quinq> ok
[12:46:04] <bagder> curl on Windows 10 doesn't even have it
[12:46:18] <bagder> I mean the default bundled one
[12:46:40] <quinq> How do people do gzipped transfert?
[12:46:59] <bagder> I guess they don't
[12:47:12] <bagder> I know there's a problem with copy-as-curl from browsers that use --compressed
