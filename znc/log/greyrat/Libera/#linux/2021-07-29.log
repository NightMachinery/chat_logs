[00:19:44] <katp32> akik: the binary in question is Factorio, which uses Allegro. the issue is audio; first of all, because the binary is dynamically linked with libpulse, it won't even start at all on a system without pulseaudio unless I use apulse. the other issue is that there's a bug in Allegro (which upstream may or may not have fixed, I can't remember) that causes a major sound delay when playing with ALSA (which
[00:19:47] <katp32> Allegro does support! even though you can't even start it without either pulse or pulse-related hacks because the devs didn't link it in a sensible way!), but Allegro also supports JACK so I could just use that right? nope, because the Allegro build linked into the game doesn't have JACK support compiled in, so I'm basically stuck without installing pulseaudio
[00:20:02] <msiism> fakuve: I don't mean to spoil your fun, but maybe Git isn't the right tool for the job.

[04:03:44] <Psi-Jack> I know.
[04:03:50] <akik> you can enable systemd in it
[04:04:02] <Psi-Jack> Don't care. But I know.
[04:04:04] <n4dir> when i investigated back then if cli only the only solution i found was the one i mentioned. ssh-agent (eval as in evil'ed from profile), then ssh-add /path/key

[04:06:48] <matsaman> newpy: probably you can run those project VMs directly from the Linux host, but yeah, you have a complicated use case

[04:07:41] <matsaman> the trend for all companies is to disallow things though
[04:07:51] <newpy> matsaman, nah the projects are put out as VM's so professors/TA's don't have to deal with variable setups

[06:41:52] <ayecee> don't fall for it, Fedora is a trap!
[06:42:14] <schuelermine> idk if other manufacturers do this but I love the Lenovo support portal

[06:43:24] <schuelermine> neshpion: both
[06:43:40] <neshpion> because if it's the latter, i would bet they're marked up a lot.  i saved a few hundred on my last order by buying base model specs and buying my own RAM & storage upgrades
[06:43:56] <schuelermine> but parts for the hard disk is probably less helpful, haven’t checked it out, it’s listed in the dropdown tho
[06:44:03] <schuelermine> also idk if they are actually selling them
[06:44:07] <rascul> hard disks aren't really something that users are generally capable or have tools to service
[06:44:24] <schuelermine> but they give you all the names & numbers & manufacturers

[06:45:21] <schuelermine> I’ve looked at the hard disks but there’s an option to see the hard disk components, too
[06:45:31] <rascul> i would be interested in seeing that
[06:45:32] <schuelermine> oh wait no
[06:45:37] <schuelermine> it’s just the hdd bracket
[06:45:39] <Psi-Jack> haha
[06:46:45] <schuelermine> but for each part, you get the make and model, a button to show images of the part, and a dropdown called “substitutes” that lists compatible alternatives
[06:46:50] <neshpion> now that's something i can see needing to order specifically
[06:47:10] <schuelermine> you can’t buy them directly but it’s nice that they have the UI on their website instead of a huge PDF or nothing at all
[06:47:42] <rascul> if the options are huge pdf or nothing at all, i would take the huge pdf
[06:47:48] <neshpion> ah, well in the event you *do* need to order something specific, you get the part number there and go to ebay

[16:41:37] <djph> given that CUPS doesn't necessarily provide drivers, saying CUPS needs an update to support something new seems a bit wrong
[16:42:19] <paulcarroty> why?
[16:42:22] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, for the most part, print manufacturers can generally provide their simple ppd's, both to cups and directly.
[16:42:34] * msiism wonders how driverless printing would work.
[16:42:47] <djph> I mean, yes, they do have a rather large selection of stuff out of the box .. but HP's stuff is nearly universally provided via hplip; brother provides their own drivers; the rest of them fell off my radar
[16:42:55] <Psi-Jack> It's literally /because/ of CUPS it's become much more standard and simplified, and even more thanks to Apple for pushing so hard.
[16:43:15] <djph> and Apple having the clout *to* push so hard.
[16:43:26] <Psi-Jack> djph: Yeaaah, Brother... Does.. in a 32-bit form of bleh.

[18:51:51] <ayecee> schuelermine: probably history an inertia. in the very resource limited age when unix developed, extra code and extra system calls were costly. later, creating new files but not directories was perceived as the default, and the alternative didn't provide enough advantage to motivate change widely.

[21:30:34] <Dagmar> If you hand a PDF creation tool a JPG which has 95% e and an effective resolution of 20480x19200 which would have a massive like 1400DPI pixel resolution or something, it's _highly_ likely to resample the JPG down to a matching 300DPI and appropriate pixel sizes for the document it's outputting

[22:14:24] <jazz> ideally you would use drives in a RAID10 configuration, with automated backups to an offsite location
