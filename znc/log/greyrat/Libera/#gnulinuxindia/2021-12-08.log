[09:35:55] <pystardust> palwd_: any progress on the clipboard sharing thingy
[09:37:11] <palwd_> pystardust: lol nah, That's just smth I'd like to do at some point
[09:37:20] <palwd_> rn I'm busy with making my website
[09:37:28] <palwd_> css is suuuper boring
[09:37:51] <pystardust> ah, true. You using any generator?
[09:38:04] <palwd_> nah just plain html and css
[09:38:20] <palwd_> Thought I should at least learn the basics
[09:38:46] <pystardust> its morning man, hugo is kinda fun
[09:38:49] <pystardust> boring*
[09:39:08] <palwd_> oh yeah, trust me dude ik
[09:39:23] <palwd_> but I think I've figured most things out
[09:39:48] <palwd_> Now I'm just messing with different layouts and seeing which I like the most
[09:41:37] <pystardust> css has nice animation thingy also, I never tried it
[09:42:51] <gtlsgamr> simplecss.org is da bomb
[09:42:56] <gtlsgamr> I love how it has NO classes XD
[09:43:02] <palwd_> yee it's crazy what all you can do with just css
[09:43:45] <palwd_> no classes?!?!
[09:43:57] <palwd_> damn I wanna know how they pulled that off
[09:44:21] <gtlsgamr> because it is pure css
[09:44:30] <gtlsgamr> like direct on the html elements
[09:44:31] <gtlsgamr> no classesd
[09:44:40] <palwd_> I mean with the number of html tags now you could get away with it, but classes just makes things more convenient
[09:45:30] <gtlsgamr> Convenient and complicated
[09:45:33] <gtlsgamr> I am also working on my site
[09:45:51] <gtlsgamr> using simplecss.org as css and markdown as a base for writingposts. A script willl then convert it to html
[09:46:40] <palwd_> ooo
[09:47:39] <palwd_> well I wanted to learn a little css anyway so that's why I chose not to use any framework or ssg
[09:47:53] <palwd_> didn't realize how boring it would get tho ;-;

[15:07:33] <pystardust> F the police use crypto, stay anonymous
[15:07:50] <vipul[m]> Arya[m]: Cuz frauds and no regulations and it completely kills the only power government has. The power to control the flow of money minting. They can't risk losing their only power.

[15:09:43] <Arya[m]> its just  saying telegram bridge 
[15:11:01] <vipul[m]> Arya[m]: It's a channel. A channel is sending that. New tg feature perhaps 👀
[15:11:16] <Arya[m]> how does it display on tg
[15:11:46] <vipul[m]> Arya[m]: The channel name as the user's Name
[15:11:56] <Arya[m]> ohk
[15:13:47] <vipul[m]> <pystardust> "F the police use crypto, stay..." <- Yeah get ready to go to jail soon.
[15:46:48] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  crypto is not anonymous it's just hard to track. Unless you use a privacy coin e.g. monero
[15:47:09] <Arya[m]> ye
[15:52:08] <relejek[m]> If you have to do kyc to get crypto, it is not anonymous. RBI is strict on Indian exchanges  to do kyc. So,  your crypto wallet  provided by an exchange is just a run of the mill Fiat wallet ,  like paytm or phonepe.
[16:02:46] <pystardust> relejek[m]: you can use bitcoin walled without kyc. (I dont deposit through cash). Like earn in crypto spend in crypto
[16:02:51] <pystardust> Wallet*
[16:03:27] <pystardust> https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/
[16:04:19] <pystardust> Even tho its isolated, i can buy amazon coupons. I can pay for online services. So its still viable cash. 
[16:05:36] <pystardust> Also if any of my personal friends want to get into crypto and deposit. They can deposit to me and i will send them crypto to their anonymous wallets (no identification). I take cash so no problem of trace back there
[16:08:10] <pystardust> vipul[m]: what do you think? how can they catch me
[16:41:59] <glizzster[m]1> https://github.com/Bugswriter/pirokit can this same thing be done with something like pirate bay or any other torrent site?
[16:43:50] <JB[m]> <klimi[m]> "do you guys experience slowness..." <- True... And i thought it was for me only because of hardening firefox

[18:15:40] <Arya[m]> ig thats the fastest sh interpreter idk
[18:15:45] <gtlsgamr> XD
[18:16:01] <pystardust> shell is bloat any ways
[18:16:13] <Arya[m]> pystardust: is dash faster?
[18:16:17] <pystardust> its either c or python, nothing in the middle
[18:16:58] <Arya[m]> lol
[18:17:02] <pystardust> Arya[m]: kind off, but if you spawn extra process then its use less. 
[18:17:05] <Arya[m]> python fanboy now?
[18:17:54] <pystardust> I like shell, but shell has its place
[18:21:04] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: I see some useless stuff, like why sourcing config every make page? you can avoid basename aand dir name and use shell paramenter expansion, you need to check if dir exists just use mkdir -p, itll ignore if it does. Also the sed can be optimized. all this ill show how tomorrow. now me go study

[19:10:15] <NeoVoid[m]> "unexpected"
[19:10:17] <relejek[m]> i mean UX
[19:10:25] <NeoVoid[m]> s/surprisingly,//
[19:11:16] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: i dont want to spoil your unexpecting experience by telling too much
[19:13:40] <relejek[m]> Neo Void  One thing for sure, it is unexpectedly light sized. Why? How? Wut? 
[19:16:50] <relejek[m]> alright here i am using this unexpected keyboard
[19:17:12] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: 🍾
[19:17:25] <NeoVoid[m]> 🥁
[19:18:27] <NeoVoid[m]> did you find it? the unexpecting thing?
[19:18:29] <NeoVoid[m]> s/unexpecting/unexpected/
[19:18:46] <relejek[m]> lol where is full stop in this
[19:19:04] <relejek[m]> i can see it but cant use it whyyyyyyy
[19:19:44] <NeoVoid[m]> yes now it is coming
[19:19:51] <relejek[m]> ohhhhh. i got it
[19:20:10] <relejek[m]> here's a ?
[19:21:08] <relejek[m]> what is this feeling ? i never i'll be this happy in learning to use a dot (.)
[19:21:12] <relejek[m]> 🤣
[19:21:29] <relejek[m]> * i never knew i'll be
[19:22:26] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: $$
[19:22:42] <NeoVoid[m]> yes it is isnt it?
[19:22:53] <NeoVoid[m]> * yes it is isnt it!
[19:22:55] <relejek[m]> yeah i am keeping it for a while. fiddle with it . may be just may be it'll grow on me. thanks for introducing me with this.
[19:23:04] <NeoVoid[m]> its a spiritiual experience for me
[19:23:09] <relejek[m]> now back to a bit normal keyboard
[19:23:26] <NeoVoid[m]> to able to press a . or ?
[19:24:31] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: 👍
[19:26:10] <relejek[m]> it is something alright. yes it is unexpected for sure as any new app is. but it is so danm light. how could that break the unwritten rule of developing bloated programs for android.

[19:37:36] <JB[m]> They are doing that 
[19:37:36] <JB[m]> Fuck everyone else
[20:14:31] <pystardust> JB[m]: its seems tedious typing on phone. You can get a external keyboard to your phone and then use termux (then you have unix experience)

[21:00:42] <glizzster[m]1> does anyone here use tutanota? or which mail service u use
[21:09:34] <relejek[m]> i have used protonmail. yet what's the point of using a privacy mail if you use PGP.
[21:10:23] <relejek[m]> or one can  use a mail client with autocrypt
[21:10:29] <glizzster[m]1> which one are you currently using
[21:10:59] <relejek[m]> privacy email service: none
[21:11:14] <glizzster[m]1> oo
[21:11:47] <relejek[m]> i just use k9 mail with autocrypt/pgp
[21:12:26] <glizzster[m]1> damn
[21:12:50] <glizzster[m]1> i just signed up on tutanota hope it will give good experience 
[21:14:08] <relejek[m]> as a review to protonmail they only do e2ee with other protonmail users. so i still have to use pgp for other email service recievers.
[21:14:35] <glizzster[m]1> ooo
[21:15:17] <glizzster[m]1> tbh i dont really want much privacy all i want is that they shouldnt sell my shit to big carporations 
[21:16:01] <relejek[m]> and they only provide imap+smtp to premium members. oh well, that was end of my trial with protonmail. that's all have to say the email service 'hidden' in the mountains.
[21:16:24] <glizzster[m]1> ohh
[21:19:12] <relejek[m]> glizzster:  just use pgp and educate your colleagues on how to use it. or just setup k9 mail (android) or thunderbird (desktop) as they setup autcrypt(e2ee) by themselves over any email server.
[21:19:26] <NeoVoid[m]> <relejek[m]> "it is something alright. yes..." <- because its from f-droid so it make sense.
[21:19:46] <glizzster[m]1> relejek[m]: oh okay, thanks for the help brother
