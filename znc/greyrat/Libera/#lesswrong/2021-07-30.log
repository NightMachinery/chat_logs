[10:15:47] <quanticle> gwern: One possibility is that sometimes you deliberately do something that will fail in order to see exactly *how* it will fail, so that you can validate that your mitigation steps are actually going to address real problems rather than problems that you've imagined. Another possibility is that the either the parameters or the results of the exercise were simply mischaracterized by whoever
[10:15:49] <quanticle> leaking the findings. A lot of the pop-defense press is all about finding the most alarmist spin on a particular leaked result, and it can take a while before you get a sense for what is and isn't a trustworthy finding. In this case, I do not believe that the finding is trustworthy because 1) DefenseOne is known to exaggerate everything they print and 2) it goes against much of the other

[10:21:18] <feep[work]> > I have seen this pattern in in my attention ocr project. Transformer decoders are auto-regressive and generative in nature. First convergence is due to decoder being able to predict next token based on previous tokens. It is best available information at start of training.
[10:21:22] <feep[work]> > I was able to achieve 50% accuracy in predicting next token in ocr project. But during inference it would generate randon sentence. Meaning it isn't looking at input image, just previous tokebs.
[10:21:27] <feep[work]> > Second drop is due to encoder. Encoder takes time to learn l. Once features from encoder starts to make some sense, its not hard for decoder to make correlation and converges immediately.

[10:23:08] * quanticle waves stick makes vague angry noises about lawns
[10:23:09] <feep[work]> it's a humorous continuation of an accidental trend
[10:23:30] <feep[work]> I am suggesting that from shawwn (accidentally?) copypasting your comment, I have picked up the notion that repeated copypaste is just what one does
[10:23:39] <feep[work]> this is false and stupid, which makes it funny
[10:24:32] <feep[work]> shawwwn: anyway, that's why I found it so cool
[10:24:37] <quanticle> feep[work]: I have a suggestion for you. You should go become Mark Zuckerberg's personal assistant. His human-to-robot translator, if you will.

[10:24:41] <feep[work]> it's like half of the network isn't even doing anything until that secnd network kicks in

[10:24:59] <quanticle> If you can't teach a robot to laugh, no one can
[10:24:59] <shawwwn> I don't think feep wants to donate his blood to zuck
[10:25:07] <shawwwn> that's how billionaires stay young right?
[10:25:17] <feep[work]> honestly my advice would be to not even try it
[10:25:31] <feep[work]> if you congenitally suck at humor, there's sort of an uncanny valley of cringe
[10:25:39] <feep[work]> better just take the autism social charity points
[10:25:47] <feep[work]> limited as they are
[10:26:51] <feep[work]> https://twitter.com/TheStrangeLog/ this is great
[10:27:31] <shawwwn> my interview question was given a list of links, check whether the links are valid in python. the answer they were looking for was to use request.head with allow_redirects=True. I said I'd use a bash script. in hindsight the bash script would've worked better than my initial requests.get solution since curl -fsSLworks roughly 100% of the time. but I guess it's still not a head request
[10:27:46] <quanticle> feep: No, Mark, this is a bad idea. Please don't try to add jokes to your presentation.
[10:27:48] <quanticle> Mark: Why not? I made jokes. You laughed at them. I am ready.
[10:27:50] <quanticle> feep: No, you don't understand, there will be people with Twitter accounts there. This is beyond your level.
[10:27:52] <quanticle> Mark: I trust my probabilities more than I trust your instincts.
[10:27:54] <quanticle> <PR disaster ensues>
[10:27:56] <feep[work]> XD
[10:27:58] <feep[work]> yes
[10:28:21] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I mean, head is kind of a bad idea tho
[10:28:30] <feep[work]> like, you don't necessarily want to just randomly spam some webservers
[10:28:33] <feep[work]> what are these links
[10:28:48] <feep[work]> and also it only works when online
[10:28:59] <shawwwn> I agree. but they would've countered with sometimes you want to check a url that's a huge download link
[10:28:59] <feep[work]> so like, "why do you want this"
[10:29:09] <quanticle> The problem is that once you get rich, the autism social charity points evaporate. 
[10:29:12] <shawwwn> so request.get would be a bad idea in that context
[10:29:16] <feep[work]> well sure, but then HEAD isn't enough because you actually want lots of info
[10:29:20] <quanticle> So at that point, like... fuck it, nothing to lose right?
[10:29:22] <feep[work]> like whether range requests are supported
[10:29:29] <feep[work]> so I'd do a small GET and stop it immediately
[10:30:25] <feep[work]> though I guess if they're fishing for HEAD, fair enough
[10:30:35] <feep[work]> I'd still just accept the URL and GET it later without checking
[10:30:50] <feep[work]> react to errors then
[10:30:51] <shawwwn> yeah but trying to do that in python while people watch you code in ten minutes is... funny. I guess I could've said that though
[10:30:56] <feep[work]> that's true yeah
[10:31:05] <feep[work]> shawwwn: yeah interview advice, always think out loud
[10:31:14] <feep[work]> like pair programming with a really lazy partner
[10:31:48] <shawwwn> sorry hal, I can't do that
[10:31:57] <shawwwn> it's either type or talk, not both
[10:32:00] <feep[work]> that's okay
[10:32:07] <feep[work]> take your time to stop typing, talking is more important
[10:32:19] <feep[work]> they're hiring your brain, not your fingers
[10:33:25] <saturn2> they should make you walk, talk, and type all at once
[10:33:33] <feep[work]> very realistic
[10:33:52] <shawwwn> I mean, it's timeboxed
[10:34:09] <feep[work]> if you talk so much your code doesn't get done, I think that's genuinely better
[10:34:10] <shawwwn> plus you end up saying retarded things when talking during interviews
[10:34:14] <saturn2> nothing about it is realistic anyway
[10:34:14] <feep[work]> but sure, if it's purely a skill challenge
[10:35:50] <saturn2> maybe juggling as well, why not
[10:36:07] <feep[work]> anyway it'd be something like
[10:37:05] <feep[work]> def main(): print([requests.head(url).ok for url in sys.argv])
[10:38:22] <feep[work]> though this will blindly return True for a redirect
[10:38:33] <feep[work]> THOUGH I think requests' decision to not autofollow redirects is, um, fucking stupid
[10:38:51] * feep[work] blinks at the config
[10:38:59] <feep[work]> shawwwn: what are they talking about, allow_redirects defaults to True
[10:42:09] <shawwwn> oh wait does it? I asked that
[10:42:16] <feep[work]> docs say so..
[10:42:20] <shawwwn> he said depends how you have it set up
[10:42:22] <shawwwn> hm neat
[10:42:26] <feep[work]> docs do not say that :P
[10:42:45] <feep[work]> oh I see
[10:42:53] <feep[work]> it *used* to be configurable in older versions
[10:43:12] <shawwwn> hm, according to https://docs.python-requests.org/en/v0.8.4/api/ it's false by default
[10:43:24] <feepbot> API — Requests 0.8.4 documentation
[10:43:28] <feep[work]> yeah but current requesets is 2.2.something
[10:43:32] <shawwwn> oh lol
[10:43:41] <shawwwn> what did google give me
[10:43:42] <feep[work]> 2.7.0
[10:43:46] <feep[work]> yeah this is the problem with google, lol
[10:43:49] <feep[work]> no idea of "outdated"
[10:43:54] <feep[work]> beyond datestamp
[10:44:10] <feep[work]> wait, the *google* hit for 2.7.0, which I presumed was current, has a thing at the top saying "this is outdated, latest is 2.9.1"
[10:44:15] * feep[work] suspiciously clicks it
[10:44:15] <shawwwn> dayum
[10:44:28] <feep[work]> no redirect beyond that. okay.
[10:44:29] <shawwwn> you're right, allow_redirects defaults to true. huh.
[10:44:44] <feep[work]> google is just being a shit there.
[10:44:44] <shawwwn> I'm ... I wonder if I like that. I guess I do like that
[10:44:49] <feep[work]> I mean yeah, pit of success.
[10:45:02] * shawwwn thinks about redirect loops
[10:45:41] <shawwwn> yeah I guess he was going for a HEAD request for the efficiency concern
[10:45:51] <shawwwn> but terminating the get request after a certain amount would be the better solution
[10:45:58] <shawwwn> though I'm not actually sure how to do that in python
[10:45:58] <feep[work]> I don't actually know what happens if you GET in a listcomprehension loop like I did above
[10:46:05] <feep[work]> I think that might actually be what happens
[10:46:08] <feep[work]> p sure requests is lazy
[10:46:26] <feep[work]> though if it gets GCed, the connections may stay open for a long time
[10:46:29] <feep[work]> so probably better to HEAD and be done

[14:20:56] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: it's just a bit of special glue
[14:21:11] <feep[work]> or rather, in a macro language, the line between language feature and library construct is blurry
[14:21:23] <feep[work]> which also means that language constructs are less problematic
[14:21:37] <feep[work]> but in this case I actually need it to be a language feature cause I'll have special syntax support for "pick from"

[14:22:05] <feep[work]> this is going to also be part of my range implementation later
[14:22:15] <rsaarelm> I mean whatever your general purpose programming language is like now, you can probably assume that come the AGI singularity, once you've been uplifted with 30 extra IQ points you're going to start refactoring it into dependent types based total functional programming by default language that'll look sorta like Haskell except with all the historical syntax cruft cleaned up, so might as well get

[14:28:06] <rsaarelm> feep[work]: Do you know the thing how Rust uses ? in the syntax?
[14:28:22] <rsaarelm> Basically syntactic sugar for explicit error handling.
[14:28:40] <feep[work]> haven't looked at that yet
[14:28:50] <feep[work]> I was thinking using it for null propagation with Maybe
[14:28:52] <rsaarelm> Though I guess if you are going to have actual exception throwing you can just use that and ignore the Rust thing.
[14:29:00] <feep[work]> hoping not to until later
[14:29:12] <feep[work]> like, I do intend my primary error mechanism to be multiple return values
[14:29:17] <feep[work]> well, sumtypes rather
[14:29:36] <rsaarelm> Also, Haskell has monads for a more generic exit-early-with-an-error mechanism, but they're sort of weird and kludgy and require lots of buy-in overall.
[14:29:37] <feep[work]> I think I'll need exceptions *eventually* cause they work really well with classes
[14:29:55] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: that if (auto a <- foo) thing is kind of meant to be monad-adjacent
[14:30:11] <feep[work]> ie. you should be able to do auto a <- foo; and automatically get a :none return if foo returns nothing
[14:30:48] <feep[work]> like do does
[14:30:57] <rsaarelm> So foo can abort the function run if it returns a bad thing?
[14:31:05] <feep[work]> yeah
[14:31:12] <rsaarelm> "auto a <- foo; print('foo did good')", print won't run
[14:31:15] <feep[work]> yep
[14:31:26] <feep[work]> but you need to have your own return type declared as Maybe x or you get an error
[14:31:36] <feep[work]> it literally just inserts a return there
[14:31:51] <rsaarelm> Yeah, maybe the thing to do as PL designer would be to be aware of monads and think about how your stuff is monad-like, even if the end user programmer isn't given keys to the monad machine yet.
[14:32:00] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: what I'm thinking is, make Maybe a general extension of the error mechanism.
[14:32:07] <feep[work]> ie. alias Maybe(T) = (T | error :none)
[14:32:27] <feep[work]> and then you can define on your own, say, read() as (string | error FileNotFound)
[14:32:37] <rsaarelm> Yeah, Haskell has some weirdly generic thing where you just sort of ...throw the Maybe at the monad code and it works.
[14:32:38] <feep[work]> and if (auto contents <- read("foo.txt")) will work just as well
[14:32:47] <feep[work]> well Maybe is a monad
[14:32:50] <rsaarelm> I haven't bought into it enough to understand it completely.
[14:32:51] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[14:32:57] <rsaarelm> And List and who knows what.

[14:33:42] <feep[work]> dbohdan: meh, I'm doing what D does and strictly defining int and long
[14:33:44] <nshepperd> the Haskell thing allows you to do any kind of pattern match
[14:33:49] <feep[work]> int = i32, long = i64
[14:34:06] <nshepperd> if the pattern match fails, it uses the appropriate failure method for your current monad
[14:34:25] <feep[work]> I am not certain this is how monads work
[14:34:40] <nshepperd> it's a separate feature which leverages monads
[14:34:41] <feep[work]> and I am also trying not to update my very tenuous understanding based on what you're saying XD
[14:35:06] <nshepperd> this is specifically when you have a pattern on the left of the arrow
[14:35:35] <nshepperd> so you can do, say 5 <- thingThatShouldReturnFive
[14:35:46] <nshepperd> and that basically acts as an assert
[14:36:11] <feep[work]> hhhhhhokay
[14:36:14] <nshepperd> and will return Nothing if it fails in a Maybe context
[14:36:15] <feep[work]> I am *not* doing that, lol.
[14:36:24] <feep[work]> that's terrible.
[14:36:47] <nshepperd> or Just x <- foo
[14:36:48] <feep[work]> (in no small part cause I already have an assert macro)
[14:36:57] <nshepperd> for some foo that returns a Maybe
[14:37:19] * feep[work] blinks
[14:37:23] <feep[work]> on reflection that is actually a good idae
[14:37:23] <nshepperd> and the x will be bound on success, or it will fail in the appropriate way on failure

[14:37:40] <feep[work]> if (FileNotFound fnf <- file.open("foo.txt"))
[14:38:15] <feep[work]> yeah I like that.
[14:38:44] <feep[work]> auto ret = file.open("foo.txt"); if (FileNotFound <- ret) exit(1);
[14:38:56] <feep[work]> hm, that one needs dynamic rebinding to be really powerful tho
[14:39:05] <feep[work]> smart rebinding*
[14:39:10] <feep[work]> that's definitely for version 2
[14:39:33] <feep[work]> ie. "if a test for a member entails a scope exit, rebind the variable to exclude that member"
[14:39:52] <feep[work]> that's Advanced Shit.
[14:40:08] <feep[work]> though you can just do else if (string content <- ret) { ... }
[14:40:23] * feep[work] blinks
[14:40:40] <feep[work]> no yeah that makes sense. yeah.
[14:40:50] <feep[work]> nshepperd: thanks a bunch!
[14:41:02] <feep[work]> I'd been wondering a bunch about "pick" syntax
[14:41:18] <feep[work]> ie. I was thinking like, if (auto contents <- file.read("foo.txt").pick(string))
[14:41:26] <feep[work]> but if (string contents <- file.read()) is much better.
[14:41:38] <nshepperd> it's important that it works with any pattern match, because it basically lets you combine assert with the logic that depends on the assert's success in a way that is un-fuckupable
[14:42:02] <feep[work]> yeah, structural validation.
[14:42:26] <nshepperd> and also does the appropriate assert for the context
[14:42:27] <feep[work]> the result of the test is the evidence of the test's success.

[17:33:49] *** Quits: inky (~inky@5.77.184.4) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:36:12] <mstevens> raymond chen is generally fascinating.
[17:37:08] <mstevens> But yes the itanium stuff and all the "compilers are going to be really smart" assumptions was interesting.
[17:37:54] <[itchyjunk]> Did compilers not get really smart?
[17:38:02] <[itchyjunk]> Like AI level smartness was needed?
[17:38:56] <mstevens> My limited understanding was more that it was very itanium specific smartness required, because it did weird things nobody else did.
[17:39:09] <mstevens> But my understanding is very limited here.
[17:39:45] <mstevens> I think this was the series: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150727-00/?p=90821
[17:39:46] <Robomot> The Itanium processor, part 1: Warming up | The Old New Thing (All those registers.)
[17:40:25] <mst> mstevens: yup
[17:41:16] <mst> [itchyjunk]: the basic problem was that itanium could do ridiculous parallelism -but- you had to actually parallelise in the asm generation to make it work
[17:41:19] <vrs> get into the mill architecture instead, it's itanium but good
[17:41:38] <vrs> (but also vaporware, which is sad)
[17:41:44] <mst> the mill architecture is using similar ideas but they're developing their own compilers

[18:51:26] <gwern> dbohdan: they can force the issue, but they might just force it in a bad way. look at all the human cloning bans on the books
[18:51:41] <gwern> if you do a bad job forcing it, people will reflexively ban it. they are always opposed to new things
[18:52:16] <dbohdan> gwern: You are right :-(
[18:52:25] <gwern> you need a fait accompli and rollout before the banners can get up a head of steam
[18:52:32] <gwern> otherwise, you wind up like cloning or he jiankui
[18:53:11] <gwern> you want ivf's path, not jiankui - done in defiance of the norms, and rolled out before the censors could pass federal legislation which would halt it for decades to come 
[18:53:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> So saturn2 mentioned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discursive_dilemma the other day and I was reading about it ... it seems to me like the solution to the dilemma is just that premise-based voting is nonsensical, because it assumes that the relationship of premises to conclusion is a simplistic sum of binary votes
[18:53:25] <Robomot> Discursive dilemma - Wikipedia (Discursive dilemma or doctrinal paradox is a paradox in social choice theory. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with majority voting can result in self-contradictory judgments. …)
[18:53:26] <gwern> repealing legislation is *so* hard even when it's blatantly absurd, like the ban on onion futures
[18:53:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But of course it's no such thing
[18:54:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, to put it another way, if I say "P, but ~Q", and you say "~P, but Q", it would be total nonsense to summarize this as "aha, we are fully agreed: we both believe that 1 out of these 2 premises is true, and the other is false"
[18:54:40] <dbohdan> gwern: It's scary to realize that IVF not getting banned was a near miss
[18:55:46] <dbohdan> I've wondered if artificial wombs could in the current political climate in America be framed as a progressive issue

[18:56:54] <dbohdan> Gurkenglas: Make them about the ability of queer people to have children
[18:57:06] <gwern> dbohdan: one could try but unfortunately, it's too easily coded as a class issue
[18:57:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or e.g. in the road repair example, the two questions are obviously different, not just in phrasing but in substance: asking three different questions which each have a weight of 1, and asking for the *conjunction* of all three, is manifestly not the same thing!)
[18:57:17] <Gurkenglas> dbohdan, ...or gay people?
[18:57:20] <dbohdan> gwern: Possibly
[18:57:37] <dbohdan> Gurkenglas: I used "queer" as a catch-all term
[18:57:41] <Gurkenglas> ah
[18:58:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And thus, there is no *self-contradiction*, contrary to the WP page's claim
[18:58:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> If one aggregation function throws away information, then of course it'll disagree with another aggregation function that doesn't do that...
[18:59:42] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, are aggregation functions that don't throw away all isomorphic?
[18:59:50] <Gurkenglas> *don't throw away information
[19:00:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: All aggregation functions have to throw away some information, but not necessarily the same info
[19:00:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Otherwise it's not aggregation
[19:02:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, look at the given example: in one case you proceed if a majority of people say yes to a majority of conditions, in the other case you proceed if a majority of people say yes to *a conjunction of all of the conditions*
[19:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> These are manifestly different criteria
[19:02:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> One is going to be harder to satisfy than the other
[19:03:13] *** Joins: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide)
[19:03:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you go "gosh, we get different answers depending on how we ask the question" - well, no, you're just asking two different questions, and thus getting two different answers
[19:03:27] <Gurkenglas> Indeed majority voting does not map different ways of phrasing the same question to the same answer. I wonder if some probabilistic method does?
[19:03:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> No! Again, it's *not* "different ways of phrasing the same question"!
[19:03:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's different questions!
[19:04:01] <Gurkenglas> Before this gets silly, we should taboo the definitions we disagree over.
[19:04:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[19:04:17] <Gurkenglas> Call syntactically the same questions identical
[19:04:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a very obvious issue, I don't want to argue about it
[19:04:37] <Gurkenglas> Call questions that a dictator would answer the same way isomorphic
[19:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why you're disagreeing tbh, it's very blatant
[19:05:36] <Gurkenglas> Our disagreement is merely over terms, I think. We can use your language if you want. What would you call the equivalence relation that they call same but you don't?
[19:06:14] <Gurkenglas> Because that equivalence relation is important and the problem they point out is as well
[19:07:52] <Gurkenglas> We would be in a better spot if we had an alternative to majority voting that didn't decide to do different things for "Should we enslave the bottom 40%? Should we do it again?" and "Should we enslave the bottom 64%?"
[19:08:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no equivalence relation here
[19:08:29] <Gurkenglas> What, is it not transitive? Show me an example.
[19:08:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The WP page (and/or the viewpoint is describes) claims there's an equivalence, but it's a silly claim
[19:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem they point out is also not actually a problem unless you decide to pretend that different things are the same
[19:09:38] <Gurkenglas> You claimed it's not an equivalence relation. That's a falsifiable claim. Show your counterexample.

[19:12:58] <Gurkenglas> That it is an equivalence relation means, mathematically, that for any path of related pairs, the ends are related. If it's not an equivalence relation, there is a path of related pairs whose ends are not related. Do you have one such in mind, or else how did you come to believe that it's not an equivalence relation?

[19:14:30] <dbohdan> mst: Ah
[19:14:45] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, "if P then (if Q then A else B) else B" has the same behavior as "if P & Q then A else B"
[19:14:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: When nshepperd2 said, yes
[19:14:59] <dbohdan> gwern: What other technologies are in the "on the horizon, probably won't arrive before AGI because of fear" bucket?  Iterated embryo selection comes to mind, but it is reproductive technology, too.  Anything non-reproductive?
[19:15:20] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: so?
[19:15:45] <Gurkenglas> "for every if, decide by majority vote whether the condition is true and false. repeat until you arrive at a decision" therefore maps if-trees with the same behavior to different decisions
[19:16:00] <Gurkenglas> which is a problem.
[19:16:16] <Gurkenglas> *"whether the condition is true or false" :D
[19:17:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> What does this have to do with the so-called discursive dilemma
[19:18:02] <nshepperd2> "if P & Q then A else B" isn't what's happening here
[19:20:54] <shawwwn> gwern: but orange tabby dumb
[19:21:03] <shawwwn> nshepperd's cat is further proof
[19:21:13] <shawwwn> can't argue with facts and logic *cue xfiles theme*
[19:21:22] <gwern> dbohdan: because of *fear*? hm. BCI stuff would go a lot faster if we could treat primates (and humans) worse. a lot of drug and medical research too
[19:21:32] <nshepperd2> i want to believe
[19:21:57] <Gurkenglas> The discursive dilemma says that "if P then if Q then if C = P & Q then Guilty else Not Guilty else Not Guilty else Not Guilty" and "if P & Q then Guilty else Not Guilty" have the same behavior but are mapped by majority vote to different decisions.
[19:23:00] <Gurkenglas> "if C then Guilty else Not Guilty", i should say for the second one
[19:23:16] <Gurkenglas> or should i? hmm
[19:23:36] <nshepperd2> the point of the dilemma is that average(P & Q) > 0.5 is different from average(P)>0.5 & average(Q)>0.5
[19:24:08] <Gurkenglas> it's probably easier to rephrase it without C, and keep in the back in one's head that P&Q=C is tautological
[19:24:44] <Gurkenglas> so it's "if P then if Q then Guilty else Not Guilty else Not Guilty" vs "if P&Q then Guilty else Not Guilty"
[19:25:02] <Gurkenglas> so, "if P & Q then A else B" is exactly whats happening here
[19:26:27] <Gurkenglas> <nshepperd2> the point of the dilemma is that average(P & Q) > 0.5 is different from average(P)>0.5 & average(Q)>0.5 <- indeed! that is the same point
[19:26:30] <nshepperd2> these are as different as 'the probability of hitting the bullseye on that wall' and 'the probability of both the bullseye and the bullet being somewhere on the wall'
[19:26:50] <nshepperd2> expecting them to be the same is like, the sharpshooters fallacy or something
[19:27:19] <Gurkenglas> P isn't "the bullet is on the wall", but "the bullet is on coordinate (0,0) on the wall"

[19:58:09] <rsaarelm> I'm trying to figure out what your baseline-acceptable homecooked chili recipe is like. Surprisingly little chili-making (as in the stew, not the peppers) culture over here. "Chili con carne" is vaguely unpleasant elementary school cafeteria staple and I guess that primes everyone into thinking it's generally crap.
[19:59:21] <gwern> nshepperd2: it'd incur a lot of metabolic costs eating something which will just be largely indigestible trash, and quite possibly poisonous in some respect (we've spent the past few billion years assuming that anything we eat is of no or the same chirality, after all)
[19:59:26] <Gurkenglas> rsaarelm, bioengineer a variant of capsaicin that binds to your taste receptor and just stays there.
[20:02:49] <rsaarelm> That idea from the soylent guys about the soylent variant that grows like algae when you just put spores in a bucket of water and leave it in the sun would be a good start.

When I looked back after five seconds of distraction, he was mid-trick; and I saw him matter-of-factly take a foam 
[20:57:16] <dbohdan> ball from his hand, put it into his pocket, and then open his hand to reveal no foam balls—to general astonishment. All his other tricks, before and after, I found completely convincing.'  https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JBtGzP5shRoN6qeuv/learning-magic

[21:10:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I am reading this thread https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,4106.msg137216.html#new ... wherein some people have brought up the question of whether it is acceptable to *not* be outraged in the face of atrocities, and from there of course the question of whether it is acceptable to stand by and do nothing while bad things are happening... someone said this, for instance:
[21:10:29] <Robomot> Kids in cages, and the carefully constrained unit of caring (Kids in cages, and the carefully constrained unit of caring)
[21:10:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This [a strong emotional reaction to some bad thing] should make us want that stuff to happen less, it should inform our priorities,but it can’t tell us whether this is the least bad option.  Letting China wipe out the Uighurs and crush the democracy movement in Hong Kong is terrible and the stories are chilling and yet, probably the best available policy for us is to not do much about it.  Knowing what’s happening and
[21:10:42] <Obormot\Arcturus>  feeling those emotions about a Holocaust-scale atrocity happening now is important, but not sufficient."
[21:11:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I was thinking about that whole "all that is necessary for evil to triumph" Burke quote
[21:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this is what occurred to me:
[21:12:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> My grandmother, as I've mentioned a number of times, survived the Holocaust. She's told me a lot of stories about her experiences... and one thing that stands out to me is...
[21:13:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> When the Germans came to her town, to take her and her family and all the other Jews away... well, some of their non-Jewish neighbors and friends did indeed stand by and do nothing, it's true. But many of them didn't stand by and do nothing.
[21:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many of them, in fact, actively joined in, and helped the Germans.
[21:14:47] <gwern> this doesn't seem like a hard question. does being not-outraged maximize expected utility over all possible acts over the future of the universe?
[21:15:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact, in Eastern Europe, most of the death squads, the polizei, the people who would comb the woods to hunt down escaping Jews... were not German. They were Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian... the Germans could never have processed so many people, so quickly and efficiently, if they'd had to rely only on their own manpower
[21:15:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they didn't know the locales, the terrain, who lived where, who was Jewish, etc.
[21:15:51] <pompolic> does getting mad at the internet minimize expected utility along the same lines
[21:16:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact, things would have been *considerably* better
[21:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> If all those people had just... stood by... and done *nothing*
[21:16:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> That would have been a tremendous improvement!
[21:17:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> But instead, a whole lot of people got up and said "Yes! I am going to do my part! I'm going to help rid my town / village / community of bad people!"
[21:17:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> People (good or otherwise) doing nothing, would've been way, way better.
[21:17:51] <gwern> if only those people had been bad people, who'd take bribes from the escaping jews! 'the virtue of vice', to paraphrase caplan
[21:17:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes...
[21:18:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And a complementary thought. Ultimately, how did the whole thing end? What ended up saving my grandmother? It was, of course, the Red Army liberating the camps...
[21:19:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the Red Army did not do that because they had undertaken some sort of rescue mission, motivated by concern and outrage for the Jews
[21:19:39] <gwern> (bit of a frying pan/fire situation, although I suppose by that point by far the worse of the famines and mass executions and gulags were done with)
[21:19:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was, obviously, a matter of national self-defense, not altruism
[21:20:09] <dbohdan> "First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out— / Because I didn't want to point out who was socialist."
[21:20:18] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[21:21:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> So in the end, it was people *not* doing nothing, people getting up and taking action, that caused such atrocity, and, conversely, rational self-interest that ended it
[21:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this is the example / reference that people use to argue the opposite point! It's always Holocaust references, in discussions like this!
[21:21:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absurd
[21:22:07] <pompolic> \o/
[21:22:13] <pompolic> this seems like a cultural tic
[21:22:16] <pompolic> self interest bad
[21:22:21] <pompolic> altruism good
[21:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, as I've mentioned before, '46 was another famine year, but yes, pretty uncontroversial that "saved from a German death camp by the Red Army" was a massive improvement
[21:23:04] <PapuaHardyNet> the death squads weren't german, eh? good old free market
[21:23:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: There was a *huge* amount of collaborationism
[21:23:31] <dbohdan> It is often said that the activist mindset is value-orthogonal
[21:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many people in many parts of (non-Russian) Eastern Europe welcomed the Germans with open arms
[21:23:42] <dbohdan> And extremists have converted from one form of extremism to its extreme opposite
[21:23:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course, it's hard to blame them for *that*, per se)
[21:24:08] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. I've always considered activists a scourge, thank you for confirming my biases
[21:24:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But helping the invaders massacre your friends and neighbors is, we must admit, somewhat more blameworthy)
[21:24:30] <PapuaHardyNet> sidenote, this seem like a really interesting book: http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=37F109211E13421972C17B6967DD4AB2

[21:24:48] <pompolic> i was beating that drum too but it made people uncomfortable to hear
[21:24:50] <pompolic> is true though
[21:24:57] <pompolic> (activist mindset being value-orthogonal)
[21:25:03] <pompolic> well, i think it's true. i could be wrong
[21:25:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And, let you be tempted to excuse it on the basis of fear or what have you, the collaborationism often far exceeded what would've been necessary to merely survive)
[21:25:44] <pompolic> i think Guided By The Beauty of Our Weapons is relevant to activism
[21:25:57] <pompolic> activist mindset being a strategy that works for any goal
[21:26:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which is also unsurprising. Changes in the ruling regime are precisely the best times to make big gains in social status. Hustle to prove your worth to the new masters, and you could be moving way up in the world...)

[21:27:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: It's of course true. For a close-to-home example, there was a post on LW a while ago where some dude was like "I was brought up an evangelical Christian, then I found Less Wrong and now I want to be an evangelical atheist! What's the best way to spread the word! Should I make youtube videos or what??"
[21:27:27] <pompolic> my cyincal take is that modal people gleefully jump on extermination campaigns if they're rendered socially acceptable
[21:27:43] <pompolic> Obormot\Arcturus: :joy: emoji
[21:28:03] <gwern> my aunts were discussing birkenstocks last night. apparently they're 'back'. although they also never really left. I get the impression that culture and fashion is increasingly weird: there are localized hyper-fast spikes in time, but also things never actually die out. zombie movies or TV series can briefly spike in popularity, but they also are just constantly made. we don't really have...
[21:28:09] <gwern> ...'fashion cycles' anymore in the sense of fashions *completely* dying out. when zombie movies used to 'go out', they genuinely went out, I bet there would be years with zero movies or series
[21:28:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder what sort of mental make up is required for someone to be an "activist"
[21:28:33] <PapuaHardyNet> it obviously is not the sort that makes people rich or very traditionally successful
[21:28:59] <pompolic> i think epistemic consequentialism is a necessary (but perhaps not sufficient) condition
[21:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Power
[21:29:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Power over other people is the most intoxicating drug
[21:29:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Far more so than mere wealth
[21:29:59] <pompolic> what i don't get is why it must be exerting power over other sentient beings
[21:30:09] <pompolic> when i beat my code into doing what i want it feels great
[21:30:18] <pompolic> and the machine is not sentient so it does not care
[21:31:00] <dbohdan> The trick is to fool others and yourself (the better to fool others) that what you are doing is 100% altruistic/pious/moral
[21:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: If you don't have the mindset, you can't understand it, obviously
[21:31:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's not an anomaly. The adaptive advantages are obvious
[21:32:46] <pompolic> i don't have it now, but
[21:33:49] <gwern> pompolic: some people care more about people than machines. so while you're at home masturbating in your power over your machine, they're out lobbying to control what you can do at home. you may not be interested in activists, but they are extremely interested in you
[21:34:16] <feep> [18:58] <gwern>  I get the impression that culture and fashion is increasingly weird: there are localized hyper-fast spikes in time, but also things never actually die out.
[21:34:20] <pompolic> true enough, although i'm not evangelizing for passivism either
[21:34:21] <feep> reminds me of that quote about the internet and media
[21:35:08] <pompolic> my full take is closer to "power over other people is actually shitty. power as in capacity to affect your environment is better when you don't need other people's help"
[21:35:56] <pompolic> power such as "knowing how to execute a particular procedure, on your own, that will get X results in Y conditions"
[21:36:50] <pompolic> as for the activist mindset, i think i wore it as a hat for a while when i was thinking it's just how everyone else behaves
[21:37:17] <feep> I cannot find it :(
[21:37:32] <PapuaHardyNet> "you may not be interested in activists, but they are extremely interested in you" nice quote
[21:37:34] <feep> it was something like, in the 70s or so someone got asked how the internet is going to affect media cultures
[21:37:52] <feep> and they said, it's not going to go away anymore than a river disappears when it reaches the ocean
[21:37:57] <pompolic> there seems to be a pattern of both internalizing things harder than normal people, but also more explicitly, affording me a way to actually factor out mindsets
[21:38:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I think it is about what you feel competent in controlling. Say you have a habit of exerting power easily over a machine, you'll prefer that over trying and failing to exert power over people.
[21:39:01] <pompolic> i think that plays a part
[21:39:09] <Obormot\Gaia> PapuaHardyNet: It's a paraphrase of Trotsky
[21:39:46] <feep> if anyone knows the source I'd appreciate it.
[21:39:46] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah I did recognize it from my past reading
[21:40:00] <pompolic> given that most people suck at getting machines to do what they want, it makes sense that they would stick to familiar ground
[21:40:14] <pompolic> getting other people to do what they want that is
[21:42:40] <pompolic> i think another difference between the two is that people generally live at a higher level of abstraction: social proof, simulacra, etc.
[21:43:11] <pompolic> i think of it like the OSI stack
[21:44:11] <pompolic> just by knowing how to work lower layers allows you to change things people living at higher layers treat beyond their ken
[21:44:43] <pompolic> treat as*
[21:44:57] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, activists are working on a higher level of abstraction?
[21:45:14] <pompolic> i would say so actually
[21:45:28] <pompolic> demonstrations etc. are for demonstrating "we can mobilize this much manpower"
[21:45:38] <pompolic> messaging is for authoring other people's social reality
[21:45:40] <PapuaHardyNet> who is working on lower levels of abstraction, then?
[21:46:07] <kuudes> pompolic, well, yes
[21:46:12] <PapuaHardyNet> demonstrations are kind of meaningless. true power comes "from the barrel of a gun"
[21:46:32] <kuudes> if it is not a democratic society that allows peaceful demonstrations, then you use that to build a guarrilla army
[21:46:37] <PapuaHardyNet> a man who cannot negotiate and can only plead for mercy is begging
[21:46:56] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, well, democracy is sort of civil war on constant periods but without the bloodshed
[21:46:59] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[21:47:20] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, I still don't get who is working on the lower levels of abstraction. Is it the people who work on the tools and technology that these activists use?
[21:47:24] <kuudes> you know "lets count how many people each side would have and then divide power based on that instead of killing each other"
[21:47:37] <pompolic> communicating energy to accelerate a chunk of metal to render a biological organism inoperable is arguably a lower level of abstraction
[21:47:46] <pompolic> but i can't think of a good example really
[21:48:09] <pompolic> one i can think of is, say, the twitter people fucking around with the timeline algorithm
[21:48:36] <PapuaHardyNet> no, that sounds actually much higher in abstraction
[21:48:55] <pompolic> the choices they make are more or less a given feature of the environment to users, which they have to deal with
[21:48:55] <PapuaHardyNet> they are also trying to control the narrative rather than committing "direct action"
[21:49:18] <pompolic> i think deterrence etc. are back on a higher layer
[21:49:22] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so lower abstraction means working with the environment, non-sentient things?
[21:49:33] <pompolic> more or less
[21:49:41] <pompolic> i don't think it's as clean as the OSI stack
[21:49:56] <pompolic> we suck at separation of concerns even when we're trying
[21:50:04] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, it's a cycle. modifying a complex system is always messy
[21:50:25] <pompolic> semiotics might also be relevant as an area of study
[21:50:38] <pompolic> or road signs specifically

[21:51:02] <pompolic> it's pretty much the study of signage afaik
[21:51:27] <pompolic> if you get to put down signs other people will/must obey, i think you're at one such lower level of abstraction

[21:52:25] <pompolic> i specifically like that example because it took me an embarrassingly long time to notice that at some point i had started treating signage as a feature of the environment

[21:57:10] <pompolic> yep
[21:57:41] <pompolic> with the "layers of abstraction" thing i think i meant to say something like "people just reify maps all the time and live in them"
[21:59:20] <pompolic> i like the examples; I was informed by a subset of those things
[22:01:03] <pompolic> speedrunning is only a recent interest of mine but the appeal of it is watching people exploit the differential between the map of the properties vs the  actual properties of the game simulation
[22:02:22] <pompolic> the most obvious difference between the security mindset and vanilla unseeing seems to me that with the security mindset that after seeing past the normal abstraction presented, you instead use a different abstraction
[22:02:28] <pompolic> one a hypothetical attacker would use
[22:03:27] <pompolic> wrt weird machines you start treating data you input as the code you give the weird machine to execute, for example

[22:15:40] <pompolic> so long as you don't want to psyop people or do some sort of annoying koan shit
[22:16:25] <pompolic> or a troll
[22:16:36] <PapuaHardyNet> you know people who attempt to use koans to convince others?
[22:16:38] <pompolic> i think trolling is literally adversarial reality authoring
[22:16:39] <PapuaHardyNet> how does that even work
[22:17:04] <pompolic> well, i can't answer that
[22:17:17] <pompolic> but i do have an anecdote
[22:17:43] <pompolic> once upon a time, there was a person who developed a particular image about me
[22:17:51] <pompolic> and tried to guide my behavior based on that image
[22:18:12] <dbohdan> RiversHaveWings: Are you going to get one booster shot or two?
[22:18:17] <RiversHaveWings> dbohdan: one
[22:18:30] <RiversHaveWings> Unless they come out with an official booster that's updated for newer strains
[22:18:57] <dbohdan> RiversHaveWings: Pfizer claims to be working on it.  https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/pfizer-says-it-is-developing-a-covid-booster-shot-to-target-the-highly-transmissible-delta-variant.html
[22:18:58] <Robomot> Pfizer says it is developing a Covid booster shot to target the highly transmissible delta variant (Clinical studies could begin as early as August, subject to regulatory approvals, Pfizer says.)
[22:19:06] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah
[22:19:09] <pompolic> this person was very wrong about my internal experience, because i generally don't let people into my internal experience. there was no way for me to communicate it at the time
[22:19:28] <RiversHaveWings> Delta's here already and I didn't want to wait for approval to do something about it
[22:19:34] <pompolic> like outside LW i can't go "epistemic humility pls" 
[22:19:53] <dbohdan> I just hope to get vaxxed for the first time soon
[22:20:14] <PapuaHardyNet> and they posited some sort of anecdote or argument that was intended to change your internal experience on reflection?
[22:20:20] <pompolic> anyway so instead of trying to do it directly, i just paid attention to what they model me as, what behaviorial predictions that will make
[22:20:22] <rmmh> kid probably has delta :toot:
[22:20:31] <pompolic> and then just went out of my way to falsify those predictions
[22:20:36] <RiversHaveWings> Israel is doing third shots of the existing Pfizer vaccine for the elderly now
[22:20:47] <pompolic> for my efforts i received a "i was wrong, sorry"
[22:20:55] <pompolic> i figure this is how koans work too
[22:21:19] <dbohdan> rmmh: Oh no
[22:21:35] <pompolic> that is, they wouldn't, if the koan author did not have some idea of how, given a particular context, what people will infer
[22:21:49] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed
[22:22:00] <rmmh> RiversHaveWings: did you have to do anything special for your booster, or just walk in and ask for a shot? 
[22:22:12] <RiversHaveWings> rmmh: I went across state lines just in case
[22:22:20] <PapuaHardyNet> but calling it a koan is needlessly esoteric. Modelling other people's internal experience is something everyone learns to do as they grow up
[22:22:31] <RiversHaveWings> But I just told them I hadn't been vaccinated yet and that I didn't have insurance.
[22:22:34] <PapuaHardyNet> it is called the theory of mind
[22:22:44] <pompolic> this is something i've been thinking about recently. the existence of koans seem to imply that we occupy a relatively small cluster of possible minds. if we find aliens i would like to see what they'd do with koans
[22:23:03] <rmmh> I guess the surfeit of doses means you're not depriving anyone 
[22:23:56] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: my theory of mind definitely developed along weird directions
[22:24:40] <pompolic> makes me wonder if i'm autistic; most people don't really seem to have that level of introspection into their theory of mind
[22:25:05] <pompolic> which is why i think i couldn't communicate "your theory-of-pompolic-mind is wrong and you should switch immediately"

[23:04:54] <feep> obormot that does not at all surprise me

[23:05:19] <gwern> (the crying is a lot less manipulative if you know women cry so much and that means less "this is the most agonizing mental pain I have experienced in the past decade" and more like "this is the saddest thing I read about this week")

[23:06:16] <ggreer> yeah
[23:06:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> What... do you mean
[23:07:18] <ggreer> she has a degree in computational linguistics. before this journalism stuff, she was working at a bay area tech company
[23:07:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hasn't she had a pretty privileged life? Middle to upper middle class American, some mild to moderate mental illness, high-status and well-paying jobs, consistently supportive friends group
[23:07:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's what I've gotten from the posts of her that I recall reading
[23:07:41] <gwern> I'm not aware of anything particularly tragic about her life. she lives in like berkeley. she goes to the fancy tech conferences (I met her at borlaug conf). she has what seems like a truly exceptional media job writing about extremely interesting things sporadically, not churning out clickbait chum
[23:07:56] <gwern> she's a lesbian and got married recently, iirc?
[23:08:08] <ggreer> then she took a massive pay cut (I think 1/3rd of her previous salary) to write for vox
[23:08:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unless there's something huge and terrible that I am unaware of, I can't imagine what could be tragic about any of this
[23:08:44] <gwern> taking a salary cut to do a luxury high-cultural-capital job is a rich elite sort of thing, so even less tragic
[23:08:46] <catern> is the implication that she would prefer to be working at a bay area tech company making 3x?
[23:08:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly she would not
[23:08:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> As she was totally free to do that

[23:10:38] <feep> sometimes we trade off personal interests for prosocial interests
[23:10:46] <feep> this is called a "sacrifice"
[23:10:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does anyone understand what feep is talking about
[23:11:02] <gwern> I too make sacrifices by not spending my money on lambos. if only I could have *both*!
[23:11:14] <catern> ggreer: oh do you mean tragic as in "she did something altruistic that's very personally expensive, but was questionably effective?" yeah I guess that's tragic
[23:11:16] <feep> I mean do you spend it on prosocial things instead
[23:11:18] <kuudes> btw why can't they just house people in normal settling centers or whatnot
[23:11:23] <ggreer> catern: yeah
[23:11:30] <kuudes> is there some specific benefit of a cage?
[23:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: We don't have anything like "normal settling centers"
[23:11:41] <kuudes> you know, a hotel and staff
[23:11:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who's gonna pay for that, kuudes
[23:11:56] <feep> kuudes: also slight problem, the us has illegal immigration
[23:11:57] <kuudes> same party who pays for cages
[23:12:05] <catern> in finland when they detain refugees they all get stays in 5-star hotels
[23:12:09] <gwern> (she still lives in luxury locations like berkeley. pretty much none of her reporting requires her to so much as live in california. she should come live with me)
[23:12:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> So just conjure up giant piles of additional money out of nowhere eh
[23:12:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or what
[23:12:14] <ggreer> border patrol *caught* a million illegal immigrants crossing from mexico last year. good luck building that much infrastructure
[23:12:15] <kuudes> the cages don't appear without money either
[23:12:43] <kuudes> catern, we have actual plans on what to do if st petersburg population decides to walk over the border to apply for asylum from putin
[23:12:52] <pompolic> forgive me for the tribalism but i feel lucky that i don't treat vegans seriously as a policy
[23:12:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> It takes a *little* more money to build a hotel with hotel staff than it does to build "cages"
[23:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know, just a little
[23:13:19] <kuudes> don't you guys have cottage villages where you will put your army if it is on the move?
[23:13:23] <feep> it is weekend I am GOING to eat a PIZZA:
[23:13:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: N...no?
[23:13:42] <feep> yes. this is good.
[23:13:50] <catern> feep: good idea, I will too
[23:14:06] <kuudes> then don't put them to cages either, sounds cheaper
[23:14:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[23:14:12] <kuudes> wasting taxpayer money on cages etc
[23:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what do you propose we do with them instead
[23:14:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shoot them?
[23:14:25] <kuudes> nothing
[23:14:36] <kuudes> usa is illegibile enough already
[23:14:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, well, that's obviously a terrible idea
[23:14:47] <kuudes> you don't have a state in many matters
[23:14:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> We do too
[23:15:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have fifty of them, in fact
[23:15:03] <kuudes> it is just a collection of random violence to random waste ends
[23:15:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's more than most people
[23:15:39] <kuudes> it seems your states can't evacuate your own people from natural disasters etc
[23:15:51] <kuudes> so I guess something happens. world is absurd
[23:16:02] * kuudes grabs popcorn
[23:16:32] <[itchyjunk]> I've been craving carbs
[23:16:35] <[itchyjunk]> Damn keto diet
[23:16:45] <kuudes> I don't know. have your marines invade your border and construct housing there for immigrants
[23:17:01] <kuudes> you can make it an occypying excercise to prepare for next iraq
[23:17:10] <kuudes> use some of those trillions there
[23:17:12] <[itchyjunk]> Will the immigrants stay across the border provided just housing?
[23:17:14] <mst> kuudes: US immigration and border policy is massively fucked up and horrible in general, it's a reasonable rule of thumb that under a GOP administration it's like 5-10% more horrible but that's about all that changes
[23:17:18] <kuudes> I don't know
[23:17:23] <gwern> ('what we need, comrade, is not 1 but *50* states!' 'we have them. might get a few more at some point too' '...oh.')
[23:17:39] <kuudes> mst, yeah
[23:17:51] <[itchyjunk]> I find US immigration to be more reasonable than say the UK's.
[23:18:05] <kuudes> just pointing that the requisite of "propose better" is absurd, as the goalposts then move
[23:18:18] <kuudes> "who pays for that?" I don't know who pays for the current and how much that pays
[23:18:34] <kuudes> it seems unlikely that one approach is significantly more expensive or cheaper than another
[23:18:40] <mst> kuudes: key problem is large chunks of the economy are dependent on illegal immigration and for any politician to admit that out loud would be career suicide so "sensible migrant worker visas so being an illegal immigrant becomes less obviously a good idea" is never going to happen
[23:18:44] <kuudes> the price differences are random, in scale of us government
[23:19:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Actually, as pointed out in this forum thread, in this case it's the opposite: it was started under Obama, got better under Trump, and now worse again under Biden
[23:19:18] <kuudes> like, maybe they could save some billions by stopping to buy some golf ball detectors or buying 4 bn pieces of ammunition for the homeland security or something
[23:19:40] <kuudes> occupying iraq cost some billion dollars per day on its hayday
[23:19:46] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: actually, the measure of 'worse' they're using isn't the one I'm using
[23:20:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Oh? How do you mean?
[23:20:19] <kuudes> this is sort of like soviet person asking how would one stop gulags
[23:20:25] <kuudes> "but that would cost so much"
[23:20:27] <kuudes> what :D
[23:20:44] <pompolic> the opportunity cost of not having gulags
[23:20:45] <kuudes> "how would you pay for prc to stop slavery on uyghurs"
[23:21:15] <kuudes> pompolic, indeed
[23:21:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I agree that just shooting people would be much cheaper, both in the "illegal immigration from Mexico" case and the "occupation of Iraq" case
[23:21:21] <pompolic> it makes sense though
[23:21:34] <pompolic> policy questions are just "how do we make people do things without compensation"
[23:21:44] <kuudes> from the data on death penalty it seems killing people is quite expensive when the state does it
[23:21:50] <pompolic> only a tiny bit serious on that one
[23:21:52] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: remain in mexico was if anything crueler than the current tent city bullshit, and the higher level of cruelty discouraged people from showing up
[23:21:54] <kuudes> you have to also take care of the bodies and there is all sorts of hassle
[23:21:58] <gwern> (trillions, at a minimum. they're wrapped up in their racism and nationalism, so you'd need to pay them *so* much resources that they'd be convinced they're safer with the money than the uighur genocide)
[23:22:05] <[itchyjunk]> If you shoot all your problems away, you end up with new problem of unemployment
[23:22:07] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: the worse/better/worse that thread is operating on is numbers of people
[23:22:16] <[itchyjunk]> you're employing all the people to solve problems
[23:22:25] <kuudes> but but. wouldn't this discussion belong to #lw-politics?
[23:22:29] <[itchyjunk]> now they become the new problem because you solved your problems by shooting
[23:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yyyyes, I agree, but is that not the same metric in the end?

[23:22:55] <kuudes> saturn2, is this politics?
[23:23:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: i.e., we cut down the influx by discouraging people, and we did that via the "remain in Mexico" thing, and the result is that fewer people are *trying*, and thus fewer people are subjected to cruelty (here or there), so... mission accomplished?
[23:23:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: It's only expensive if the state does it to people with rights
[23:23:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Shooting people in war or similar is relatively cheap
[23:24:08] <[itchyjunk]> Is it though?
[23:24:12] <[itchyjunk]> What about those missiles they use
[23:24:13] <kuudes> iraq cost 1bn&day
[23:24:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not, like, *super* cheap, but much cheaper than administering the death penalty - orders of magnitude)

[23:25:11] <[itchyjunk]> If they shoot back, it starts getting expensive it seems
[23:25:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: You gotta make a moral judgment of the actual facts, and I am saying that by (what appears to be) your moral measure, the worse/better/worse dynamic is as described
[23:25:38] <kuudes> iraq war seems to have got ~500k deaths per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War
[23:25:40] <Robomot> Iraq War - Wikipedia (The Iraq War[nb 1] was a protracted armed conflict from 2003 to 2011 that began with the invasion of Iraq by the United States–led coalition which overthrew the authoritarian government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the coalition forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government.[ …)
[23:25:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Unless your moral standard here is very unusual?
[23:25:48] <kuudes> so if it took 1 year and 365 bn$
[23:25:56] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I'd also point out that if we're going that route, all the republican shouting about open borders contributed to it so it's 'worse' because of them as much as anything else
[23:25:57] <kuudes> then it is ~0.5bn$ per death
[23:26:06] <kuudes> which does not seem very cheap
[23:26:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Not sure I follow?
[23:26:11] <[itchyjunk]> That implies US got nothing out of it
[23:26:15] *** Joins: luna-is-here (~quassel@ip-95-223-58-220.hsi16.unitymediagroup.de)
[23:26:22] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: then you're not calculating this sensibly and I don't have the energy
[23:26:28] <[itchyjunk]> Idk if they did get anything out of it or not, but that assumes no return in investment
[23:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: No, I am just asking what is the referent of "it" in that sentence?
[23:26:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "republican shouting about open borders contributed to it" - to what?
[23:26:58] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: increased numbers of migrants
[23:27:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... how
[23:27:24] <mst> if you can't work that out, you're not even trying to think here
[23:27:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a totally novel perspective to me
[23:27:50] <pompolic> speaking as a non-american peasant it does sound a bit enticing
[23:27:58] <pompolic> they just...let me in to the promised land?
[23:28:02] <mst> also, remain in mexico primarily meant the migrants were brutalised somewhere off US soil, not -not- brutalised
[23:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Republicans ... what ... objecting to open borders? Contributed to there being *more* immigrants?
[23:28:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yes, we're agreed on that, we covered that part already
[23:28:53] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: republicans massively exaggerating how welcoming of migrants a dem administration would be naturally makes them more likely to show up, just like extra cruelty to the ones who do show up makes them less likely to show up
[23:29:01] <Dyo> mst: who does the brutalizing in that case?
[23:29:13] <mst> Dyo: IIRC usually mexican gangs
[23:29:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Ok, yeah, I see. Well, I think that is a totally daft claim, sorry
[23:29:42] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: but it's -entirely- perceived treatment that affects whether they set out in the first place
[23:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I think the idea that Republicans railing about open borders in American media somehow made people think we have open-er borders than they thought before (while Democrats actually advocating for open borders somehow *didn't* have the same effect??) is more than a little silly
[23:31:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the kind of tortured motivated reasoning one would only engage in if one were desperate to dunk on one's political enemies
[23:32:02] <mst> oh, no, I'm sure democrats doing so had an effect as well, pretending I must not think that is precisely the sort of bullshit that's why I tried to cut this conversation off
[23:32:06] <pompolic> i think there's an interpretation under which it makes sense, but it reflects poorly on the object of interpretation
[23:32:25] <mst> if you're going to make stupid assumptions like that about me then you're just being a dick, not trying to actually have a discussion
[23:32:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although in your case I can only assume you yourself are not directly guilty of this, but got it from your American friends who engaged in said motivated reasoning)

[23:32:52] <pompolic> who's to say this is not true for most people?
[23:32:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> To the point where the former is negligble *at best*
[23:33:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And this, on top of the fact that the Democrat effect is *itself* minimal)
[23:33:33] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: my perception is the %age of democrats actually wanting open borders is relatively low, and they're not getting their way at all, whereas the %age of replicans -claiming- that *Biden* wants actual open borders has been quite high
[23:33:43] <pompolic> such a person would not know what USA's border policies actually are, but they could potentially take the republican map of "border control not good" as base reality

[23:34:30] <catern> open borders is good
[23:34:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> You may be excused for thinking that because open borders advocacy is the subject of a truly staggering amount of motte-and-bailey-ism in the U.S.
[23:34:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (mst, I mean)
[23:35:05] <pompolic> oh yeah clarification: "border control not good" in the above is meant to say "insufficient" rather than "not morally good"
[23:35:08] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, plenty of the leftards go on about open borders all the time
[23:35:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[23:35:42] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: but high profile GOP politicians claiming Biden wants it seems much more common than high profile dems -actually- wanting it, and Biden seems to be ignoring those entirely
[23:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That's an almost meaningless comparison, tbh

[23:36:10] <mst> catern: my thing here is: open borders. welfare state. pick at most one.
[23:36:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not even sure how we would measure that
[23:36:39] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm looking at it in terms of perception of would-be migrants and the effect on their decision whether to trek or not on the margin
[23:36:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do we compare "how often do people say other people want a thing" to "how often some other people want that thing"? It's not even the same units
[23:36:47] <mst> I'm not sure how to effectively measure it either
[23:37:04] <catern> politics is the mindkiller, maybe the reasons #lesswrong is talking so much about politics is because you're aging
[23:37:12] <catern> it's similar to your conservative grandfather
[23:37:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (fwiw, I agree that Biden doesn't "want" "open borders", because Biden is well past that level of senility where talking about what he does or does not want is pointless and nonsensical)
[23:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The actions that "Biden" takes are more profitably viewed as the output of a mostly-opaque political machine driven by various internal jockeying and external pressures, rather than the goal-directed behavior of an intelligent agent
