[00:54:31] <int-e> remii: Here's an idea... why don't you make the A_1 and A_2 that you need symbolic constants and proceed to see what rho will be in terms of those?
[00:54:46] <int-e> Then see what they need to be for the limit to be 0 as desired?
[00:54:46] <seninha> This is one of those edge cases like building automata for ∅ or ε, etc.
[00:55:24] <int-e> (Or maybe you've heard of partial derivatives. Those would do the trick too.)
[00:56:10] <remii> int-e What do you mean by the first approach? Well, taking the partial derivatives and evaluate them?
[00:56:36] <int-e> seninha: Well, {}^* isn't empty but your automaton accepts nothing.
[00:57:00] *** gentooclimax is now known as climax
[00:57:21] <int-e> seninha: So something is amiss.
[00:58:10] <remii> int-e Partial derivatives gives me that the coefficients are both 0.
[00:58:24] <int-e> remii: That works.
[00:59:49] <remii> int-e So \rho(h, k) = 4hk?
[00:59:58] <int-e> ?

[03:26:40] <PlanckWalk> So there might be 10 red, 8 green, and 11 blue, and you're drawing 9 marbles from a bag containing 100 total marbles.
[03:27:03] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[03:27:34] <PlanckWalk> Then there's C(29,9) ways to get that, out of C(100,9) in total.
[03:27:37] <Me-me> Oh I see. So you're saying, in the combinations of 15 colours that are 6 or more colours, you calculate the odds of each combination.
[03:27:47] <Me-me> And add those up.

[03:29:02] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  It's tedious, but that's why a program :)

[03:29:17] <PlanckWalk> 2^15, so 32768
[03:29:33] <PlanckWalk> Well, you can ignore the empty set of no colours.
[03:29:40] <Me-me> Wait what
[03:29:43] <Me-me> Why 2^15

[03:31:04] <PlanckWalk> So it's a factor of 2 per colour.
[03:31:27] <PlanckWalk> I wouldn't do it this way for 40 colours, because 2^40 is too many.
[03:31:31] *** Joins: absentia (~absentia@user/absentia)
[03:31:42] <Me-me> This spreadsheet is telling me there are 5005 different combinations of 6 in a sample of 15.
[03:31:48] <Me-me> Why isn't that what we want?
[03:32:23] <PlanckWalk> For exactly 6, yes
[03:32:39] <Me-me> Okay...
[03:32:42] <PlanckWalk> I thought you needed 6 or more though
[03:32:48] <Me-me> I do.
[03:33:13] <PlanckWalk> Also to calculate the number of ways to get 6 colours, it's easiest to also calculate for less than 6
[03:33:24] <Me-me> Okay. I buy that.
[03:33:25] <PlanckWalk> (By inclusion-exclusion)
[03:33:51] <Me-me> So how do we calculate that.
[03:34:22] <PlanckWalk> Well, like in my red/green/blue example
[03:34:41] <Me-me> Oh, I see.
[03:34:48] <PlanckWalk> There are C(29,9) possible draws that result in only red green and blue marbles
[03:34:48] <Me-me> I think.
[03:35:08] <PlanckWalk> But, some of those are only red, or only red and blue

[03:36:41] <Me-me> No, I don't see. So there are three layers ... the number of different colour combinations that are [5 or less colours], the chance of drawing [a given combination] ... and then you sum and invert that number.
[03:36:48] <Me-me> s/that number/those numbers/
[03:37:07] <Me-me> Is that right?
[03:38:31] <PlanckWalk> I'm not sure what "sum and invert" means there
[03:39:18] <PlanckWalk> Basically I'm aiming to count possible draws that result in some outcome
[03:39:25] <Me-me> For each of [the number of different colour combinations that are 5 or fewer colours], you calculate the odds of drawing that combination, and you sum all those calculations together. Then 1-that, and you have the answer.

[03:39:39] <PlanckWalk> Ah right
[03:40:10] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that works.  Calculate the probability of 5-or-less, then subtract from 1 works.
[03:40:37] <Me-me> Is there a better way to do it?
[03:40:58] <Decker> ... but could be 13 or less and still not have any of 1...
[03:41:18] <confuzeus> PlanckWalk: why can't they attempt at least 2 out of 3 colours first? if they can do that they can surely do their actual problem, save for the slightly careful counting.
[03:41:28] <Decker> sounds a lot like bingo odds though... 15x5
[03:41:31] <PlanckWalk> There might be, but with 15 colours this is fasible
[03:41:41] <PlanckWalk> feasible* and simple to program
[03:41:55] <Me-me> Alright... how many combinations of 5 or fewer colours are there in 15 colours.
[03:42:09] <PlanckWalk> Hmm ... looks like 4943
[03:42:15] <Me-me> And how did you get that number?
[03:42:21] <PlanckWalk> Sum_{n=1 to 5} C(15,n)
[03:42:37] <Me-me> Right... makes sense. Let me punch that in to my spreadsheet.
[03:43:53] <Me-me> Yar, perfect. Okay. Now how do we calculate the odds of a given combination in the draw cards?

[03:48:01] <Me-me> What does that mean?
[03:48:32] <PlanckWalk> For each set with 1 colour having x1 marbles, there are  C(x1, n)  ways to draw that colour alone (which will be zero for x1 < n).
[03:48:56] <Me-me> Where n is the number of marbles in the bag?
[03:49:04] <PlanckWalk> n is the number drawn

[03:49:57] <PlanckWalk> For 2 colours with x1 and x2 marbles, there are  C(x1+x2, n)  ways to draw a group that contains only those two colours (but may not contain both)
[03:50:15] <PlanckWalk> To get the ways of drawing both, you need to subtract the ways of drawing only one.
[03:50:17] <int-e> Hmm. Doing this properly with PIE makes it basically instantaneous. https://paste.debian.net/1231570/ (No, I won't explain.)

[16:59:46] <wakeup> for example, I could have [[1, 1, 2], [4, 1, 1]] or [[1, 1, 3], [4, 1, 1]]

[17:28:54] <tantalum> Consider the function g(i) = 3^{2^i mod 210} mod 1333, noticing that 1333 = 31*43.  (We have the prime factors of the outer modulus.)  For i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., we can compute g(i) and form a sequence.  This sequence eventually closes a cycle back on itself, but it's not circular in general.  I'm interested in estimating the length of these cycles from the prime factors.  I believe I cannot easily do this because I seem unable to apply
[17:28:54] <tantalum> Lagrange's Theorem (for groups).  I'm trying to understand why Lagrange's Theorem doesn't work here.  Let me show you my counterexample.  Computing the sequence from the g(i) above, I get the sequence 3, [9, 81, 1229, 152, 443, 298, 826, 1113, 412, 453, 1260, 1330], where the brackets denote the cycle, so this sequence has a lonely 3 at its tail.  The length of the cycle is 12.  Computing g(i) mod 31 and g(i) mod 43, we the two new
[17:28:54] <tantalum> sequences, namely 3, [9, 19, 20, 28] (mod 31) with cycle length 4, and 3, [9, 38, 25, 23, 13, 40] mod 43 with cycle length 6.  Notice 12 = lcm(4, 6).  I have a strategy to estimate the cycle length mod 31*43 if I can find a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6.  I thought of Lagrange's Theorem and phi(31) = 30 and phi(43) = 42, but 30 is not a multiple of 4.  So this seems to be a counterexample and Lagrange's Theorem isn't working here
[17:28:54] <tantalum> probably because phi(p) isn't working as I think it should here.  Is it because these cycles do not form a group?  I think they form a subgroup of S(12) in this case, a subgroup of the group of permutations of 12 elements.  Now I'm wondering if a group of permutations does not let me use phi(p) as a multiple of the order of any element in the group.  (I think that's my problem.)  Do you see where my shaky knowledge is here?  Can you
[17:28:57] <tantalum> educate me on this?  Thank you so much.

[20:32:44] <addem> Intuitively there should be such a point inside the unit disc.
[20:33:04] <addem> And I know that f is continuous, the unit disc is compact, so its image is compact.
[20:33:27] <addem> Can then map this with the Euclidean square norm (continuous too) and so that's compact, so you get a point of maximum magnitude.
[20:34:21] <addem> You'd guess this is a point with horizontal tangent plane, so to speak.  But I'm struggling to show that part.

[22:22:14] <pikapika> "Always" may not be correct
[22:22:41] <pikapika> I only did it for planes that have the y-axis on them and are at a fixed angle above the x-y plane

[22:24:56] <pikapika> Decker, circles parallel to the polar tangent will remain circles in the stereographic projection (as well as orthographic projection).

[22:40:42] <zincy_> It seems as though if you have an equivalence relation that gives you a canonical projection
[22:41:33] <zincy_> Whereas if you don't use an equivalence relation you can still create a quotient map but it is not called the "natural" or canonical projection/quotient

[23:01:42] <pikapika> Decker, I redid calculations with a general plane this time, but also checked particular values for the previous class of planes
[23:01:47] <pikapika> The curves are actually not ellipses
[23:01:57] <pikapika> and are some interesting non-trivial shapes
[23:02:10] <pikapika> as expected
[23:02:36] <pikapika> the part of the great circle in the northern hemipshere is elongated, and the part in the southern hemisphere is shortened
[23:02:49] <brownorange> We are told if math is inconsistent you can prove the liar paradox. But the only time that happens if is both is inconsistent and the paradox is false. emphasis on AND.
[23:02:55] <Decker> but so are the sides
[23:03:02] <pikapika> there is symmetry in the E-W axis, which is reflected in the projection too
[23:03:11] <pikapika> Decker, no my choice of that family of curves was deliberate
[23:03:15] <pikapika> so that there is symmetry in E-W

[23:32:21] <Decker> well it is :) but you get a 4x4 matrix
[23:32:24] <pikapika> The interesting bit was the derivation of the second vector
[23:34:42] <pikapika> Basically, I took as given the 'Z' axis with direction cosines (a,b,c). Letting the next vector be (a1,b1,c1) and using the facts that its dot product with (a,b,c) is zero and the sum of squares is one, I got an equation with a1,b1 (or any other two of the cosines) as unknowns. Upon which we can set one of these unknowns to any value of our choosing, I chose 0 for ease of computation.
[23:35:30] <pikapika> So we solve this equation to get the other two direction cosines in terms of the known values (a,b,c)
