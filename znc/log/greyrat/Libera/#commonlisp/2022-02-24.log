[12:04:02] <hashfuncc47> i understand that 123 gets bound to a list since it is specified as a &body parameter, but why is said list trying to get evaluated?
[12:04:04] <hashfuncc47> i suppose that unless you're only using macros to generate a templated form, it cannot be garaunteed that a form passed to a compile-time-only-macro will not get evaluated? that's the only conclusion i can come to

[12:16:05] <hashfuncc47> so a macro is just a form, designed such that the arguments passed to said form will not be evaluated in it's lambda list of which it is associated with. but, after that, anything's possible baby
[12:16:54] <beach> A macro is a function that takes source code as an argument and returns source code as a value.
[12:17:51] <beach> Try (funcall (macro-function 'when) '(when x y z) nil)
[12:20:30] <hashfuncc47> for sure for sure. but i think a definition that is less assumptious would be, "A macro is a function that takes source code as an argument". since it very well might not return any source code, but instead be full of code that has side effects?
[12:21:56] <beach> It has no choice.  When the compiler (or evaluator) sees a macro form, it calls the macro function, and it uses what the macro function returns and compiles it in place of the original macro form.
[12:22:24] <beach> But, sure, that return value could be something relatively harmless in most cases like a constant.
[12:24:47] <hashfuncc47> i definitely have a more solid understanding of lisp now. slowly but steadily the pieces are coming together. i truly believe this is the language of the future. i don't see it any other way. beach, thanks for the help the past few days

[17:17:26] <Josh_2> I need to serialize and store a hash table in Postgres, any suggestions?
[17:18:51] <jackdaniel> what are the keys? what are the values?
[17:19:27] <Josh_2> Well for now I'm not very concerned with either of those, I just want to jam the result in my database
[17:20:22] <splittist> But if the keys are bignums and the values are nested objects, that's going to be very different from fixnums and 20-char strings.
[17:20:23] <jackdaniel> well, you know - your hash table may have as a value another hash table (for example), or a package, or a function
[17:20:45] <jackdaniel> and that nother package may have a few symbols in it
[17:20:50] <jackdaniel> s/nother/another/
[17:21:07] <jackdaniel> but if you don't have such concerns, then use cl-store and serialize the hash table to a binary vector
[17:21:15] <jackdaniel> and store that as a blob
[17:21:18] <Josh_2> its json parsed with jonathan
[17:21:33] <Josh_2> json from an api call
[17:22:21] <Josh_2> Okay I'll give cl-store a try

[20:21:04] <Guest74> scymtym: it's unfortunate.  There was no reason for them to do so for that extension as there was no chance of them running out of event numbers.  It's been almost 8 years! So took my brain a while to remember all the problems.
[20:22:18] <Guest74> Since most people that use clx events seem to have custom macros to define handlers it shouldn't be much work to incorporate the decoding there.
[20:24:25] <Guest74> It's much uglier if you hack into the event reader to special case for this one extension.  though if you did it would probably be nice to just read the "data" portion, and then change the event number to what clx expects it to be and then shove it back onto the event queue and clx will decode it properly and everybodies event dispatching will
[20:24:25] <Guest74> work as planned.

[20:25:19] *** Joins: dirtcastle (~dirtcastl@103.43.203.225)
[20:26:19] <Guest74> it's ugly because you have to somehow know within the event reader what extension number is given to randr, which is only possible once a connection is open and may be different for different displays.  So that may be an issue for  people like me who will open up a connection to their phone.
[20:28:00] <Guest74> the problems that prevented other more useful extensions to be implemented are much uglier.
[20:28:28] <Bike> Xach: quicklisp question - we're seeing that the architecture.builder-protocol quicklisp downloads does not seem to correspond to any commit in scymtym's repo, and the downloaded version has a bug in it. do you know what could be going on?
[20:29:14] <scymtym> Guest74: i was thinking maybe we can keep the event declaration and use a special decoder that dispatches on the sub-type in the declaration body. but i haven't tried it
[20:29:23] *** Joins: clos-encounters (user@2600:3c00::f03c:92ff:fe19:3350)
[20:30:54] <Guest74> scymtym: the problem is knowing which extension you are dealing with.  As the data portion of a reply is usually used for other things.
[20:31:48] <scymtym> Guest74: i think that part of the dispatch including the dynamic registration of extension events works? maybe i'm misunderstanding
[20:33:15] <Guest74> I might not be remembering correctly.  I'm not sure if the event reader has the display object. or if the translation to an internel event number is done before the event is read.  I'll have to check.
[20:33:25] <scymtym> i'm thinking about defining the second event as (declare-event :rr-notify …) where … would use a decoder that looks at the sub-type and decodes the rest of the event accordingly
[20:36:01] <Guest74> is that quoting me or you saying something?
[20:36:32] <scymtym> not quoting
[20:36:34] <Guest74> if you just work on the part after it's dispatched it's fine.
[20:36:52] <scymtym> yeah, that's what i want to try
[20:37:31] <scymtym> the situation is kind of bizarre. apparently the were ok with allocating two events ids but not four
[20:37:35] <scymtym> *they were
[20:37:36] <Guest74> you also just declare the second event to be a list of all the events that it encompasses.  It'll give some semblance of being proper.
[20:38:31] <Guest74> yes, they did stupid stuff.  Or at least stupid stuff from our viewpoint.  I guess they figured they just hack in a union and choose based on the data.
[20:38:58] <Guest74> s/also/can also/
[20:39:04] <scymtym> i'm not even sure i need any of RRNotify events. i just want to reload the screen geometry when is (un)plugged
[20:39:51] <Guest74> i think you need the output notify for that.
[20:40:30] <Guest74> funny, i was actually going to start working on dual monitor stuff this year.
[20:41:18] <Guest74> I've only ever used the screen-change-notify because so far I've only been concerned with changing resolution and rotating my screen.
[20:43:19] <scymtym> i fixed a bunch of the other stuff already so i can inspect the output configuration properly
