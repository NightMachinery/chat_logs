[05:13:27] <bilb_ono> If I do select count(*) from table_A LEFT JOIN table_B ON table_A.some_id = table_B.some_ID, it should never return more rows than the number of rows from table_A right? 
[05:13:53] *** Joins: grooverman (~grooverma@179.97.175.157)
[05:14:03] <bilb_ono> because its a left join, it should return all rows in table_A and only when there is a match return the table_B rows
[05:15:08] <bilb_ono> oh wait I guess that would be a minimum, not a maximum.. 
[05:17:25] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@177.248.156.216)
[05:21:21] <thumbs> bilb_ono: incorrect
[05:21:57] <thumbs> bilb_ono: the on clause might introduce duplicates, and count(*) might exceed the rows from the left most table
[05:25:13] <bilb_ono> thumbs: so if I have a table and I want to add a column to it from another table, only when some match exists to link them, otherwise it would be null, and it would return exactly the same number of rows that are in the original table, do I still want to use a join ? 
[05:25:48] <thumbs> bilb_ono: "add a column" is ambiguous here
[05:26:46] <bilb_ono> so the information is from table_b. if there is a match where we can find the table_b row that matches the table_a row, write the table_b column in the result table
[05:26:52] <bilb_ono> everything else is from the table_a table
[05:26:58] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@177.248.156.216) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[05:27:15] <bilb_ono> I know thats select table_a.*, table_b.some_col but I can't figure out the from
[05:27:56] <thumbs> bilb_ono: you mean "insert a row", likely
[05:28:23] <bilb_ono> I don't want to alter table_a or table_b 
[05:28:29] <thumbs> bilb_ono: if the rows in table_a already exist, then you want an UPDATE with a JOIN
[05:30:33] <bilb_ono> I want to output a list of rows (call it temp_table_c), one for each row in table_a. Select * from table_a. But then I also want to I guess "VLOOKUP" the value in table_b where table_a.some_id = table_b.some_id. And add that column to temp_table_c
[05:31:05] <thumbs> bilb_ono: you keep using "add that column to" and I don't think you know what that means
[05:31:40] <thumbs> bilb_ono: you either insert a row in a table, or update an existing row where you can set the value of any number of columns you like
[05:32:07] <bilb_ono> I should say "include that column in the results"
[05:32:13] <bilb_ono> not add that column
[05:32:19] <thumbs> bilb_ono: that's just part of the SELECT clause
[05:32:23] <bilb_ono> yeah
[05:32:30] <bilb_ono> so now I need to determine what type of join to use
[05:32:38] <bilb_ono> to join table_b to table_a 
[05:32:52] <thumbs> do you have matching rows in both tables to join on?
[05:32:57] <bilb_ono> yeah
[05:33:04] <thumbs> then you want a INNER JOIN
[05:33:21] <bilb_ono> but, that seems to produce more rows than exist in table_a
[05:33:32] <thumbs> bilb_ono: see my initial comment about this
[05:33:50] <thumbs> bilb_ono: if your entire set has duplicates as a result, you can use SELECT DISTINCT
[05:35:33] <bilb_ono> ok so that gives two rows as output
[05:35:49] <thumbs> are the complete two rows duplicates of each other?
[05:35:53] <bilb_ono> that means.. there are two matches basically
[05:36:48] <bilb_ono> this is the query https://bpa.st/FSMA
[05:37:11] <thumbs> bilb_ono: and what do you not like about that output?
[05:37:31] <bilb_ono> I guess I want 1 row for every row in the first table
[05:37:40] <bilb_ono> maybe thats doesn't make sense
[05:37:55] <thumbs> bilb_ono: perhaps you should illustrate your problem better
[05:38:54] <bilb_ono> is there some type of sql bin that I could create a sample problem with? 
[05:39:05] <thumbs> sure. dbfiddle.uk
[05:39:54] <thumbs> bilb_ono: also, don't use () about DISTINCT - it applies to the entire row, i.e. SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2 FROM ...
[05:40:15] <thumbs> bilb_ono: alternately, you can use SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col1) FROM tbl
[05:42:39] <bilb_ono> Im using bigquery and Im not sure if thats allowed 
[05:42:54] <bilb_ono> but ill do the same thing in postgres to learn about the joins 
[05:43:02] <thumbs> a test case does not need to be large
[05:50:58] <bilb_ono> Im not sure how to share these but https://bpa.st/6ORA
[05:51:18] <bilb_ono> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_14&fiddle=1415f6b333198104e3950181f0ecee50
[05:51:40] <bilb_ono> man it works perfectly. oh let me add more rows 
[05:51:48] <thumbs> ok, so you have a match. What do we need to do here?
[05:52:07] <thumbs> yes, add enough data to show the problem
[05:53:19] <bilb_ono> ok so here https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_14&fiddle=204c13c882aa68933b4ae4dd1102ddac
[05:53:36] <bilb_ono> it produces 1 row. I was hoping for 3 rows - 1 for every row in table_a
[05:53:54] <thumbs> if that is what you want, use LEFT JOIN
[05:53:56] <bilb_ono> apples, secret_grapes, oranges, secret_grapes, pears,secret_grapes
[05:54:27] <bilb_ono> when I do that rows 2 and three are null 
[05:54:36] <bilb_ono> but actually it does have 3 rows so thats an improvement
[05:54:58] <thumbs> bilb_ono: yes, since an outer join will produce NULL values for non-matching rows
[05:57:10] <bilb_ono> oh
[05:57:31] <thumbs> bilb_ono: NULL for the right-most table, if you use a LEFT OUTER JOIN, yes
[05:58:28] <bilb_ono> hmm so how do I get apples,secret_grapes,oranges,secret_grapes,pears,secret_grapes?
[05:59:13] <bilb_ono> I guess I would also need exactly 3 table_b rows? 
[05:59:49] <bilb_ono> or a non-primary key where its just 1,1,1 on table_a
[06:00:07] <bilb_ono> cool that works
[06:00:13] <bilb_ono> so why doesn't the bigquery one work?

[09:10:03] <humanBird> What is the main strategy for database back ups across providers?  I was reading a horror story about some guy who used digital ocean soley for their data and lost everything.  i'm pretty sure that hosting services don't play nice with one another so I will have to do all the heavy lifting to make sure a database in aws is the same as one in
[09:10:03] <humanBird> linode is the same as one in aws/azure/google cloud whatever.  What tools are there to make sure that a live production database can stay the same across all providers and provide seamless failover in case one provider decides to go belly up?
[09:14:19] <humanBird> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/different-replication-solutions.html wow.  ther'es a bunch of strategies with a bunch of trade offs
[09:19:32] <humanBird> i saw some 40 TB "backup" things at best buy the other day. wonder if i can also use that.

[09:43:52] <Xgc> humanBird: Your DBA or team of DBAs will handle those strategies, all different for different products / deployments.  There's no single solution.
[09:47:40] <humanBird> i don't really have a team of dbas heh.  i just don't want to get to the point of some disaster happening without good recovery
[09:48:29] <humanBird> even if it just means "copy to backups as we go" "swap in backups, create new backup if something happens"  as s simple strategy.
[09:49:14] <humanBird> and the backups live across geographical regions AND providers
[09:49:47] <humanBird> guess the starting point is to look at some of the db offerings managed or otherwise that these providers give you
[09:51:27] *** Quits: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.77.43) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:58:29] <Xgc> humanBird: Usually, backup and recovery includes many steps, some to handle application state for safe management.  It's really never just the backup step or the recovery step alone.  Even that step can be complicated base by case.
[09:59:39] <Xgc> humanBird: The tools will exist for most databases.  It's how they are deployed that leads to clean backups that can be restored properly.
[10:00:37] <Xgc> We may all use the same tools, but only a few of the backups made will likely be safe to use.
[10:01:00] <Xgc> or stored safely at all.
[10:02:00] <humanBird> that doesn't sound right.  what's the point of a backup if it's not to be used in the case of the "main" db failing?
[10:02:00] <Xgc> Some instances will be easier than others to maintain.  It will be case by case.
[10:02:24] <Xgc> humanBird: What does "main db" mean to you?
[10:03:04] <humanBird> database that lives in the same datacenter as the primary webserver/load balancer
[10:03:11] <humanBird> as I understand things...
[10:03:12] <Xgc> humanBird: You asked a question involving multiple providers.  How can there be one strategy in this case?
[10:04:21] <humanBird> i'm reading something about hot/warm standbys.  i think that different datacenters are basically just different "homes" where dbs live.  and the overarching strategy is to get these dbs to talk to all the other homes
[10:05:13] <humanBird> it looks like postgres has something called pgpool-II or something that abstracts a cluster
[10:05:33] <humanBird> each database instance in this cluster living in a different "home" would be my understanding of it
[10:06:49] <humanBird> hrm. the more i read, the more i feel like this pgpool-II is like "kubernetes for databases".
[10:07:54] <humanBird> well. maybe just for postgres
[10:07:58] <Xgc> humanBird: Your strategy will be based on your deployments, and likely specific to the hosting providers you are using. Any change in that setup very often requires re-evaluation of the specific strategy.  But the general concepts remain.
[10:09:51] <Xgc> humanBird: Just listen to your own comments about which tools can be used with PG.  Any change in this changes your process.  If PG becomes Oracle, lots of things change.
[10:10:41] <humanBird> oracle can buy postgres?  they aren't owned by anyone like mysql (sun)
[10:10:45] <Xgc> Whether your application can have down-time, and how much down-time, can change the process.
[10:14:18] <Xgc> humanBird: This is #sql.  Maybe you thought you were in #postgresql

[23:10:33] <ifohancroft> Hi! I'm using MariaDB 10.1 with PHP 8.1 and I'm trying to figure out if multi inserts with more than one column are possible with prepared statements? I.e. This: $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO test(id, something, something2) VALUES (?,?,?), (?,?,?), (?,?,?), (?,?,?)");
[23:11:41] <thumbs> ifohancroft: what happened when you tried?
[23:12:45] <ifohancroft> thumbs: I haven't tried yet as I am confused about the binding parameters part. When specifying the value types I don't know if I should specify based on the number of columns I'm writing to or the number of values/records or somehow both? 
[23:13:17] <ifohancroft> I.e. the example gives this: $stmt->bind_param('iiii', ...$values); but in the example the insert looks like this: $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES (?), (?), (?), (?)");
[23:14:19] <ifohancroft> So I don't know if as the first parameter for bind_param I should specify 'iii' or 'iiii' or 'iiiiiiiiiiii'
[23:14:41] *** Joins: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk)
[23:15:00] <ifohancroft> The other thing is: In the example, values has this form: $values = [1, 2, 3, 4]; in my case, do I supply a multidimensional array?
[23:16:05] <thumbs> prepared statements, in general, require you to enumerate the values
[23:18:16] <ifohancroft> So if I'm understanding correctly, $values should be a single level array that contains 12 values according to the example case I'm asking about? And the parameters part should be the same? 12 times i?
[23:22:59] <ifohancroft> Here's a hopefully clearer and shorter versions of what I'm trying to ask. When filling the values array, whether you have VALUES (?), (?), (?) or VALUES (?,?,?) examples show a single dimension array with 3 values. If I have VALUES (?,?,?), (?,?,?), (?,?,?) do I specify a single dimension array with 9 values or a 3 dimension array with 3 values per dimension?

[23:29:16] <ifohancroft> Also, same question for the data types. If I have VALUES (int, str, binary), (int, str, binary), (int, str, binary), (int, str, binary) do I just specify 'isbisbisbisb'?
