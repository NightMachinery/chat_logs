The error messages imply that the repos for my 10.9 version are not longer supported. there seem to be "oldstable" repos but I don't know how to reach them and I can't upgrade to get the recent repos.

[04:42:49] <jmcnaught> awal1: in this case apt prompts to allow the suite change, apt-get does not.
[04:42:50] <Hash> Also, if you do dhcp server minimal in debian, do you also need to do DNS, right?
[04:42:56] <Hash> To  know what ips belong to which machines?
[04:43:55] <awal1> jmcnaught, ok, thanks (my was just a general curiosity)
[04:44:08] <awal1> my question ^
[04:44:44] <jmcnaught> awal1: in general apt-get will never change so that it does not break scripts, so all improvements are happening in apt brings in new stuff like improved search, and its upgrade command is better because it installs new packages without requiring dist-upgrade (which can remove packages).
[04:47:15] <awal1> jmcnaught, yes. i agree. i think the new apt will be a robust pkg since it have features of various main apt frontends (aptitude, apt-get, apt-cache...)
[04:47:55] <awal1> and with the new apt you write less words :D

[08:46:33] <gordonfish> alMalsamo: Are you certain that you're dd'ing to /dev/sdX and not /dev/sdX1 (whole drive, not a partition) ? I ask because I've seen this mistake happen before.
[08:46:58] <alMalsamo> gordonfish: This whole time I am dd'ing to the root block device file /dev/sdb
[08:47:17] <gordonfish> If you're sure the dd was done right, what are you seeing exactly when attempying to boot from it?
[08:47:24] <gordonfish> attempting*
[08:47:36] <alMalsamo> I've tried debian-live-11.2.0-amd64-kde.iso        debian-live-6.0.1-amd64-kde-desktop.img  debian-live-7.5.0-amd64-kde-desktop.iso   debian-live-9.3.0-amd64-kde.iso

[08:47:44] <alMalsamo> and only 11.2.0 works
[08:47:55] <gordonfish> (I assume you also checked boot order and any usb options)
[08:49:09] <gordonfish> alMalsamo: You might need legacy or other such boot options for older OSes perhaps, depending on the motherboard/firmware/BIOS-(emulation on newer systems)
[08:49:18] <alMalsamo> gordonfish: There is a Boot Menu listing both of my SSDs (which are totally empty) PCI LAN and USB HDD
[08:49:31] <alMalsamo> I select USB HDD and it blinks for an instant and returns to Boot Menu
[08:49:44] <gordonfish> What happens when you attempting booting one of the non-working ones?
[08:49:45] <gordonfish> Oh
[08:50:37] <gordonfish> I would go into your firmware/BIOS setup (it'd help to know what motherboard and firmware/BIOS you have) and look at all the boot and USB related options.

[12:59:19] <roger21> hey there
[12:59:50] <jelly> you're a rock star
[13:02:17] <roger21> so how should i manage having two postgresql version on my debian ?
[13:02:52] <roger21> i am on deb 11 from deb 10 and it installed pg 13 whil i was using 11
[13:03:06] <roger21> and nothing changed so its ok
[13:03:12] <Cool_Fire> Ideally you should probably migrate
[13:03:17] <roger21> i see both server are started
[13:03:45] <Cool_Fire> But as long as they have different data paths/config they shouldn't bite
[13:03:56] <Cool_Fire> But you probably won't get security patches anymore for the older one

[13:06:59] <Cool_Fire> As long as they're both official debian packages, it should fix itself once you remove the old version. But you can manually fix it with update-alternatives whenever you want too (Or call the full path of the executable)

[13:08:41] <roger21> oh so psql can connect to both servers it seems
[13:09:24] <Cool_Fire> As long as the protocol hasn't chnaged (and I assume it has not) it shouldn't have any trouble doing that
[13:10:44] <roger21> so lets say i want to create a db user with createuser, how do i chose the server
[13:11:08] <roger21> and when i connect with postgresql user is it linked to a server ?
[13:11:22] <Cool_Fire> I think they'll have a different unix socket/port that you connect to?
[13:11:46] <roger21> does justr using the v13 of createuser will do ?
[13:12:04] <roger21> they dont have the same port for sure
[13:12:12] <roger21> the rest seems the same
[13:13:15] <Cool_Fire> I'm not familiar enough with the createuser process to know for sure how to answer that
[13:13:31] <roger21> oh i can tell the port on createuser so that should do ?
[13:14:56] <Cool_Fire> That should be a good way to know for sure which version you're talking to

[13:17:51] *** Joins: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy)
[13:18:17] <jelly> do not recommend removing the old package without doing migration first.
[13:18:59] <roger21> its a package matter its a database matter, my database is on 11
[13:19:06] <roger21> not*
[13:19:35] <jelly> but you need binaries from postgresql-11 to be able to do the migration, I think
[13:20:55] <jelly> this was before, when the command was called pg_upgrade; https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Using_pg_upgrade_on_Ubuntu/Debian
[13:21:42] <jelly> roger21, what does "pg_lsclusters" say when you run it as postgres user
[13:22:29] <roger21> 11  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log

[13:25:01] <jelly> do you have any data in the cluster for the new version?
[13:25:35] <roger21> hmm nope since i'm don't know how to use it
[13:25:47] <jelly> if not I suppose you'll want to nuke that and do pg_upgradecluster
[13:26:10] <jelly> do you have a backup of this machine?
[13:26:26] <roger21> well not really
[13:26:34] <roger21> but ok
[13:26:42] <roger21> i mean it makes sense
[13:27:20] <jelly> or at least a pg_dump?
[13:27:23] <roger21> but i was just looking for using pg 13 as a side dish of my current database
[13:27:37] <roger21> nota switch
[13:28:00] <jelly> you will NOT receive security patches for postgresql-11 now that OS is Debian 11
[13:28:19] <jelly> if that's acceptable you can keep using 11 I guess
[13:28:52] <roger21> i was looking for a way to use pg 13
[13:29:04] <roger21> not as a switch
[13:29:22] <roger21> as a "hey lets use thiw one too, why not"
[13:29:23] <jelly> pg_lsclusters told you it was on port 5433
[13:29:31] <roger21> ok
[13:29:49] <roger21> so all i have to do is tell the port in all the commands
[13:30:18] <jelly> yes, 5432 is default and need not be specified

[13:33:29] <roger21> what do you mean "finish the release upgrade" ?

[13:38:58] <jelly> roger21, you did a release upgrade from debian 10 to debian 11.  debian 11 came with a new postgresql server version.  Old version is not supported any more.  You probably want to use supported software.  Therefore, it's a good idea to move your database to the supported version of database server software.

[13:40:58] <jaggz> I wonder how in the world I have this empty folder, when dpkg -S doesn't show any packages with it (or does dpkg -S not search dirs.. hm): /usr/share/fonts/truetype/roboto/unhinted/RobotoTTF/

[13:42:54] *** Joins: ledeni (~ledeni@fedora/ledeni)
[13:43:39] <jelly> roger21, the release upgrade process does not remove old postgresql server because you need the software to do a migration manually, and also, that migration can take a lot of extra disk space.  So it's not done automatically.  You need to do it yourself, and only when it's successful and everything works on pgsql 13, then you can remove old packages.
[13:44:03] <roger21> ok
[13:44:16] <roger21> it could be said during the migration
[13:44:34] <roger21> well anyway i indeed lack of space to do so
[13:44:35] <jelly> I think it does.

[13:45:34] <jelly> if you followed the release notes, you should have most of the output saved with "script" tool
[13:45:49] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[13:45:49] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades.

[16:00:58] <ivanhoe> I'm trying to figure out if my graphics card supports KMS. Judging from this https://wiki.debian.org/KernelModesetting#AMD.2FATI_GfxCards KMS is enabled by default via /etc/modprobe.d/radeon-kms.conf. If I don't have this file is it save to assume my card does not support KMS? The card is an RS480M [Mobility Radeon Xpress 200]

The problem is that when I am connected to at least one of them - all the traffic seems to go there, even though I executed `nmcli connection modify ${vpn_name} ipv4.never-default yes` for both vpns and both ipv4 and ipv6. How to solve the problem?

[19:37:19] <PerfDave> Yes, according to `man resolv.conf`: "If there are multiple servers, the resolver library queries them in the order listed."
[19:37:46] <PerfDave> It's fairly standard for a VPN connection to push DNS server information, assuming there are domain names which can only be resolved via the VPN.
[19:37:56] <jelly> network-manager should be smart enough to set up split dns, but maybe dnsmasq needs to be installed
[19:38:06] *** Joins: gce108 (~gce@user/gce108)
[19:38:10] <FreeBDSM> well, damn. 2 VPNs bring +3 nameservers and they get placed first in the file + there's a note 'the libc resolver may not support more than 3 nameservers'
[19:38:28] <jelly> you can't solve it with just /etc/resolv.conf
[19:38:31] <PerfDave> You could run a separate resolver locally and try to forward queries to the "right" nameservers, but I'm not quite sure how you'd go about it

[19:39:00] <PerfDave> Then again, I have a practice of running one VPN per system and using VPNs where necessary
[19:39:11] <FreeBDSM> jelly, dnsmasq-base is installed
[19:39:14] <jelly> resolv.conf cannot send only some queries to one nameserver, or retry when first one says "domain does not exist"
[19:40:33] <jelly> I know this works with dnsmasq and N-M on older ubuntus (16.04) and with systemd-resolved on newer ones
[19:40:39] <FreeBDSM> jelly, I'd be content with just different order: if my local DNS would got 1st and then would go DNSes from VPNs (1 from each) - I suppose that'd be more than fine

[20:23:21] <jelly> with just /etc/resolv.conf you _can't_ do split dns at all
[20:23:30] <jelly> right
[20:23:47] *** Joins: craigevi1 (craig@user/craigevil)
[20:23:48] <FreeBDSM> but then what's the point of having more than 1 DNS specified there?
[20:24:00] <jelly> simple redundancy
[20:24:02] <FreeBDSM> just for the case when the whole DNS is unreachable - the next one gets tried?
[20:24:07] <jelly> correct

[20:26:43] <Haohmaru> mmm, the dark ages
[20:27:59] <jelly> more things you did not know about glibc resolver:
[20:28:39] <jelly> /etc/resolv.conf is read exactly once per process, first time the process needs to resolve a host name
[20:29:09] <jelly> if you have long running services, they will not reread it
[20:29:31] <FreeBDSM> does sighup cure them?
[20:29:35] <jelly> no
[20:30:03] <jelly> web browsers have special code to detect changes and reread the file
[20:30:24] <FreeBDSM> well, although I forget about such stuff (I actually had read about it before) it didn't really affect my tests, as I tested with curl, so new process was spawned each time
[20:30:39] <jelly> indeed.
[20:32:39] <jelly> imagine for a moment you change one of two nameservers in an institution, fix resolv.conf everywhere and move on with life.  Wait a year or so, change the other one.  Suddenly services break.
[20:33:35] <jelly> alternatively, change the first one.  Wait years.  Then shut it actually down.  Things break.

[20:35:16] <jelly> that's one institution.  If you have _public_ resolvers, used by customers you can't control directly, you basically can't change their IPs ever
[20:36:02] <FreeBDSM> this doesn't sound right
[20:36:10] <sussudio> my isp's old dns server seems to be gone... might have something to do with the machine it ran on, a "sun 4000"?
[20:36:46] <jelly> sussudio, I bet there were hundreds of customers that noticed when it was finally gone
[20:37:59] <sussudio> well, the resolv.conf changes automatically on ip renew, so the ip would no longer be in there, but i used to use it to see if my connection was up by pinging the ip

[20:40:15] <jelly> at $work, a small ISP, we had the public resolver IPs unchaged since... 1999 maybe
[20:40:20] <sussudio> oh, they sold off the ip block... that'll do it.
[20:40:23] <jelly> since dialup times
[20:41:21] *** Joins: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy)
[20:41:49] <jelly> worse, router firmware is crap, so you need to have _both_ IPs up all the time because if the first one fails, routers gets confused and windows machines timeout queries faster than routers... no dns.  "internet does not work!!!"
[20:42:07] <Haohmaru> jelly so you work at an ISP, eh?
[20:42:17] <jelly> yes
[20:42:22] <Haohmaru> your job is to make sure nothing disturbs the flow of cat pics
[20:42:23] <Haohmaru> ;P~
[20:42:23] <sussudio> yeah around the same time. started with a weird little modem that was supposed to be for a home security system, but they started using them for users. it only did 8KB both ways, i think.

[22:22:09] <randall> jelly: It's a server I'm setting up, there's no data on it that I can't spare.

[22:30:19] *** Joins: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor)
[22:30:21] <jelly> do you mean more than 1MiB alignment
[22:30:21] <randall> I guess I should file a bug report? Since the boundary ought to be 4096B.
[22:30:41] <jelly> because your initial setup sda3 _was_ 1MiB aligned
[22:31:01] <jelly> just not 2MiB or 4MiB, it had an offset of 1025 * 1MiB

[23:28:56] <Randolf> I was looking in the "Power" section earlier, but couldn't find autosuspend in there.  It seems the trick to getting that option in there is to add the non-free firmware.  I suppose this means it's tied to the hardware in a proprietary way.
