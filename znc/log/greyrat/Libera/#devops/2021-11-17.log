[02:07:39] <trafficjam> rawtaz: lol just like you
[02:07:57] <rawtaz> yup :)
[02:12:00] <Dus10> yo... mkay, so I thought Azure Pipelines would just set the variables from a variable group to be environment variables...
[02:12:08] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Haha!
[02:12:24] <Dus10> looks like none of my TF_VAR_ prefixed ones are getting passed into to Terraform
[02:14:29] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: :D
[02:14:50] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Hang in there!
[02:15:18] <kwilczynski> Speaking of hanging. Does anyone know of some place looking for people? I could use stable paycheck :)
[02:15:25] * kwilczynski has run out of savings
[02:15:26] <kwilczynski> ;D
[02:15:52] <Dus10> you can troll Upwork while you look for more permanent accomodations
[02:15:59] <Dus10> I haven't had much succes
[02:16:27] <Dus10> a bunch of companies from NYC that want you to limit your time to 5 hours per week, and then try to get you to do 15 hours per week of work without paying for it
[02:16:39] <kwilczynski> I had bad experience.
[02:16:40] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: oh i will keep you in mind if i come across something. i probably wont but ill keep it in mind
[02:17:01] <kwilczynski> People want to pay peanuts because I am in ... and I quote "soviet Europe".
[02:17:01] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:17:20] <Dus10> ha
[02:17:30] <kwilczynski> GO WORK FOR FREE YOU BOLSHEVIK SLAVE! 
[02:17:33] <kwilczynski> And such.
[02:17:34] <kwilczynski> :>
[02:17:56] <Dus10> well, we're in the process of buying a company and they hire folks outside of the US... so maybe something in the future
[02:18:30] <kwilczynski> Dus10: I will convince you.
[02:18:35] <kwilczynski> Dus10: I work for $5 / h :P
[02:18:40] <kwilczynski> As per Upwork.
[02:18:41] <kwilczynski> ;]
[02:18:57] <Dus10> that is almost free you bolshevik slave!
[02:19:07] <kwilczynski> Harrr harr!!!
[02:19:09] <kwilczynski> ;D
[02:19:09] <rawtaz> Dus10: please see if you can loop kwilczynski into that - its not like i know him personally, but from the time we've spoken here online i have a good feeling that he really knows stuff and has skills.
[02:19:28] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: But, I don't know anything.
[02:19:32] <kwilczynski> That the gist of it.
[02:19:49] <kwilczynski> :>
[02:19:51] <Dus10> wants money... knows nothing... is owned by soviet Europe
[02:20:06] <kwilczynski> Living the life, eh?
[02:20:07] <kwilczynski> ;]
[02:20:31] <kwilczynski> We have amazing social programmes in Europe.
[02:20:35] <kwilczynski> Eastern Europe especially.
[02:20:43] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: noone knows anything it's just a matter of not being as incompetent as the others are

[02:20:59] <kwilczynski> High employment rates.
[02:21:00] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:21:11] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Ahh well.
[02:21:40] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:21:50] <kwilczynski> Speaking of work.
[02:22:11] <kwilczynski> When you are hiring someone, and require Kubernetes knowledge, what sort of depth you want?
[02:23:00] <kwilczynski> Would you require candidates to know every attribute in the, let's say, Deployment YAML.
[02:23:32] <kwilczynski> Or things like... explain in details how networking works there, or what makes kube-proxy tick?
[02:23:33] <kwilczynski> I wonder.
[02:33:35] <Dus10> I hate doing ugly things... I just had to specify them in the damned pipeline
[02:33:38] <Dus10> so nasty
[02:33:51] <Dus10> at this rate, I should just quit using extensions and just do everything as script
[02:35:15] <Dus10> woot, so all good
[02:35:34] <Dus10> now I just want to stash the TFPLAN into an artifact for review and download
[02:53:01] <kwilczynski> Woohoh.

[02:55:02] <kwilczynski> No idea

[12:41:17] <shad> Hello, i'm writing an API in Flask that I intend to run in kubernetes for production. The `kind: Deployment` will run my API container alongside its PostgreSQL and have the db write its data as mounted volume from AWS EBS. All is well i think
[12:42:34] <shad> Now, the API is written in Python using Flask, SQLAlchemy & Flask-Migrate (Alembic). I need to run the migration scripts against the postgresql at db creation and on each db migration. Where should that step fit in the whole thing ?
[12:43:52] <shad> The command i have to run is something like `FLASK_APP=app.py flask db upgrade` that will look for the generated migration directory containing the migrations scripts. I thought about having `CMD="flask db migrate && gunicorn ...` in my Dockerfile, but it doesn't feel right to me. Any other ideas ?

[13:06:41] <kwilczynski> That would be a bad use of them.
[13:06:54] <kwilczynski> So you run database inside the same container as the application?
[13:10:47] <kwilczynski> shad: You could try a sidecar and such. But it might be an overkill too. Too complex and fiddly, I suppose.
[13:14:29] <shad> kwilczynski: i run the db in the same kind: Deployment
[13:14:38] <shad> in a separate container
[13:16:01] <kwilczynski> Got it. Two containers then. :)
[13:16:13] <kwilczynski> shad: Also interesting. People tend to run data stores separately.

[22:14:58] <baakeydow> rawtaz: yes indeed because I've created a new vps instance from a backup in order to have more ram + more disk storage
[22:16:42] <rawtaz> honestly what i would do is make it such that i have one volume for the system, and the a data volume for all my data and stuff
[22:17:09] <rawtaz> the one you now have for your system seems a bit large (the OS probably only takes about 5 GB at most)
[22:19:07] <baakeydow> rawtaz: what tool do you recommend I use in order to achieve that ?
[22:27:11] <rawtaz> not sure, i guess that depends on what the system you're working in/on is in the first place
[22:28:29] <rawtaz> bbiab
[22:29:06] <baakeydow> alright thx for having taken the time to answer me
[22:30:21] <rawtaz> uh but like yeah, i gues you can use LVM for this, assuming you can add the existing volume to a pool. look that up :LD
