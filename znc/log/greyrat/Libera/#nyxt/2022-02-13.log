[19:38:35] <Guest9877> oh hi. :)
[19:39:07] <Guest9877> does nyxt log to a file?
[19:43:20] <ardon> What is a good way to get the user configuration from Nyxt's init file? I've defined a user class and I'd like to save the user provided settings through define-configuration to a global variable, but since my system gets loaded before the init file I can't capture it. I've also tried adding an after-init-hook which sets that variable to no effect.
[19:47:13] <waleee[m]> Guest9877:  no afaik. So you will have to redirect the output of nyxt -v , ie nyxt -v > nyxt.log
[19:48:53] <Guest9877> i see, thanks! i didn't know about the -v flag.
[19:50:41] <waleee[m]> It enables debug output. I assumed you didn't want just logs of the urls loaded and such
[19:51:05] <ardon> Nevermind, the after-init-hook worked!
[19:53:15] <Guest9877> mmm, i wanted to see some traces for when i was experiencing bugs.
[20:11:35] <Guest9877> When I run the command `set-url`, there are two sections: "New URL or search query" and "Global history". As I'm typing the url I want to visit, I can see it in the "Global history" section but it quickly gets out of view as the ddg suggestions pop in.
[20:12:43] <Guest9877> is there a way to tab to the "Global history" ?

[21:26:20] <waleee> Guest9877: there also a setting that disables the ddg suggestions,
[21:26:23] <waleee> (define-configuration buffer
[21:26:26] <waleee>    ((search-always-auto-complete-p nil)))
[21:26:47] <Guest9877> waleee[m]: Oh that's cool. I'm using the default CUA mode, but I just tried the vi-mode, and it worked.
[21:27:42] <waleee> Guest9877: ah, it was just ctrl+j in the other modes :)
[21:28:55] <waleee> (apologies for the switch in nickname answering, I use matrix as phone irc-bouncer)
[21:41:16] <Guest9877> waleee: not a problem.:) Â I couldn't get ctrl-J/ctrl-K to work on the other modes, except when in a multiple mode of "vi-insert emacs".
[21:45:30] <waleee> oops. ctrl+pagedown/pageup
[21:46:36] <waleee> Guest9877: if you execute describe-bindings you get a buffer with a list of the current active keybindings
[21:47:20] <waleee> J/ctrl+j/ctrl+pagedown is bound to select-source-next in that list
[21:48:42] <Guest9877> waleee: Is there a way to execute commands when a prompt-buffer is active?
[21:50:57] <waleee> there was a question here or the discourse,  possibly an issue on github about it
[21:51:17] <waleee> but I don't remember the answer
[21:51:24] * waleee checks
[21:52:27] <Guest9877> I managed to get a "Command to run in current prompt buffer", by pressing "f1 b" while the prompt buffer was up.
[21:52:40] <waleee> ah, nice :)
[21:52:46] <Guest9877> But I don't see the describe-bindings in the list :'(
[21:53:24] <waleee> oh, it might be restricted to prompt-buffer stuff
[21:54:30] <Guest9877> ya, I think so. I can see a lot of prompt-buffer commands. But I can see the command "select-{next,previous}-source" and the bindings! greawt!
