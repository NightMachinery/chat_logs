[00:00:48] <rcf> Because not everyone uses GPT, PARTUUID can't be universal. Because not all filesystems have a meaningful UUID, UUID can't be universal. And that's not getting into what happens if you happen to image a drive and end up with two identical devices that seem valid. 
[00:00:53] <A17__> Fr0stBit: the first, intelligent half of what rcf said. It's not a "preferred" one because they're quintessentially the same thing in terms of use. The PARTUUID is just useful because you don't have to update your FSTAB if you format the partition, but in most cases, if that one partition is the root partition, then it really doesn't matter, because the FSTAB is gone

This has created /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI. I've created an Arch.conf as per the guide here https://github.com/spxak1/weywot/blob/main/manj.md - but when I select the Arch entry in systemd-boot it just reloads 
[06:00:35] <gimmel> the systemd-boot menu without error. My PopOS install still works.

[07:30:09] <kevr> as far as i know, by default, you boot to a pop os efi stub that doesn't have multiple boot options, it just boots into popos.
[07:30:23] <kevr> You have to change that to something that deals iwth multiple boot options.

[07:39:22] <gimmel> kevr: It's not a System76 laptop. It's a generic laptop with Pop_OS installed. Pop_OS doesn't use rEFInd by default, it uses systemd-boot. The systemd-boot I have installed is now the arch version. It boots to an OS selection screen where I can choose the Arch entry I created (which doesn't work) and Pop_OS. Pop_OS works - so I think my issue is more related to how I've setup Arch. Hence asking here.

[07:58:23] <kevr> Note the `efi`, `linux` and `initrd`
[08:00:58] <kevr> gimmel: "Note that entries in esp can only use files (e.g. kernels, initramfs, images, etc.) in esp. Similarly, entries in boot can only use files in boot."
[08:02:33] <kevr> i don't think you're supposed to be supplying the stub in `linux`, like you are.
[08:03:30] <kevr> gimmel: Since your EFI partition is a massive 4.7G, you could just mount this to /boot in arch, reinstall the kernel, then set it up properly so `linux` points to the kernel and `initrd` points to the initrd image.

[08:04:54] <kevr> Since your entries exist within your ESP, the kernel and initrd must be accessible in your ESP. The major problem right now is you don't have them in ESP, they're all in nvme0n1p4.
[08:05:27] <gimmel> So somewhere I've gone wrong in the Arch install that has put the files in n1p4 instead of /boot ?
[08:05:28] <kevr> (Because Arch Linux installs them to /boot

[08:05:53] <kevr> gimmel: Not exactly. You probably followed it correctly, it's just that with systemd-boot, this is a requirement, and that i don't believe is mentioned directly in the installation guide.
[08:06:13] <kevr> Normally, most people just mount their esp to /efi or /boot/efi
[08:06:18] <kevr> I'm thinking you probably did the same.
[08:06:28] <kevr> For systemd-boot via esp, this won't work though.
[08:06:36] <gimmel> Ok - from here, what would you suggest is best practice?
[08:06:47] <A17__> gimmel: Are you familiar with UEFI and how it works?
[08:06:53] <A17__> Compared to legacy?
[08:07:00] <kevr> you still have your nvme0n1p4 mounted to /mnt, yes?
[08:07:41] <gimmel> A17__: *familiar* might be a strong word. I understand it to only a basic degree. I'll admit that.
[08:07:47] <gimmel> kevr: no, but I can re-mount it there.
[08:08:07] <kevr> Instead, let's do this: Boot up live arch iso. Let me know when you're in at the root shell.
[08:08:31] <A17__> gimmel: fair enough, I was the same way until I read this article. if you at least understand how old booting works, I think you'll find this quite clarifying: https://www.happyassassin.net/posts/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/

[08:18:54] <kevr> Alright, now, before you go ahead with anything else, edit /mnt/etc/fstab

[08:31:13] <kevr> gimmel: Just to clear one thing up for you: the reason that it doesn't use the /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI there at all is basically, you installed systemd-boot to your efi partition as is, so from systemd-boot's perspective, its loaded up when /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is executed by your motherboard's UEFI config.

[15:09:13] <MrElendig> Fr0stBit: anyone sane does
[15:09:24] <Foxboron> Always. EFISTUB is the most complicated way to manage any bootable EFI system

[18:15:55] <predicament> and my VPS has no steam
[18:15:55] <Namarrgon> yeah
[18:15:58] <predicament> so it's not just steam
[18:16:15] <predicament> no way possible
[18:16:15] <MacGyver> predicament: Might be something else on the VPS.

[18:17:19] <johnhamelink> Hi, I'm having some bluetooth woes setting up bluetooth - specifically I'm seeing "Bluetooth: hci0: unexpected event for opcode 0x2005" whenever I try to scan. How best should I troubleshoot this? Thanks in advance!

[18:19:41] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: I'm running Kernel 5.14.12, It's a desktop and the bluetooth card is "0b05:1868 ASUSTek Computer, Inc." according to lsusb -v
[18:20:12] <NetSysFire> did this start happening recently or did you just start using bluetooth?
[18:20:18] <predicament> wtf
[18:20:30] <predicament> cant find pactree on vps but can on my local box?
[18:20:44] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: just started using bluetooth on an existing install that's otherwise working well
[18:20:50] <predicament> i cant find it anywhere
[18:20:53] <MacGyver> predicament: It's part of pacman-contrib
[18:20:59] <MacGyver> Not something necessarily installed.
[18:20:59] <predicament> .. hang on
[18:21:26] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: (FYI I'm happy to blow away all the bluez-related cobwebs and start again if that's easier)
[18:21:48] <predicament> yeah it just shows openssl
[18:21:53] <NetSysFire> johnhamelink: no i was specifically interested if it might be a regression or something
[18:21:59] <NetSysFire> how do you scan? bluetoothctl?
[18:22:00] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: gotcha!
[18:22:09] <MacGyver> predicament: Then you can probably remove it safely from that machine.
[18:22:14] <NetSysFire> some laptops also do weird stuff but we do have laptop pages in the wiki
[18:22:15] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: yep, I've also tried using hcitool scan
[18:22:33] <predicament> wait
[18:22:38] <predicament> there's two packages
[18:22:43] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: I believe this board is a wifi/bluetooth combo type thing
[18:22:54] <predicament> one is just openssl and one is openssl-1.0
[18:23:09] <MacGyver> Yes, and openssl-1.0 can be safely removed if nothing depends on it.
[18:23:13] <predicament> no that isnt right it must just be looking at hte command when i tab

[18:24:22] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: yep, also disabling and running it directly using bluetoothd -n -d
[18:24:28] <predicament> so i can't remove it
[18:24:47] <MacGyver> predicament: Pastebin the output.
[18:25:07] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: to be clear, the link above shows the same error coming back from Bluez, but in my case I'm not even able to see any results when I scan
[18:25:14] <predicament> nevermind

[18:26:09] <NetSysFire> but this feels like a long shot, but bluetooth is so hard to debug
[18:26:23] <NetSysFire> theres also a bluez channel on here but i dont know how active it is

[18:27:05] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: that's not a bad shout either. If I continue to struggle I will try there also
[18:27:14] <MacGyver> predicament: Probably as a dependency for something at some point, then that got updated to depend on openssl proper.
[18:27:25] <predicament> right
[18:27:30] <predicament> well i'm glad i ran it
[18:27:41] <NetSysFire> johnhamelink: also try searching for the error message with quotes ("") around it next time, this will yield more accurate but less results. same applies to the pci/usb id. might help you find more stuff
[18:27:42] <predicament> i came across it while looking for some development tools
[18:28:14] <remanifest> Hey all, sorry if anyone addressed my question earlier. I had to do a hard reset. Since updating to plasma 5.23, Dr. Konqi keeps popping up to show that baloo_file_extractor closed unexpectedly. Yesterday, after creating and switching to a new user profile, this didn't happen. However, it's happening again today. Secondly, when my computer locks, it has to be force reset. Any ideas on what I can do? Maybe deleting something in .config?
[18:28:27] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: thank you, that's good advice - can I ask what you searched for to find the launchpad.net page?
[18:28:37] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: because that one slipped by me
[18:28:41] <NetSysFire> "Bluetooth: hci0: unexpected event for opcode 0x2005"
[18:28:45] <NetSysFire> literally this one with quotes
[18:28:48] <AMDIsOurLord> Get rid of search indexer Baloo or reconfigure it?
[18:29:16] <johnhamelink> NetSysFire: ah, fair enough!
[18:29:35] <remanifest> AMDIsOurLord: How can I reconfigure it?
[18:30:41] <NetSysFire> remanifest: might be ~/.cache. and why does your computer lock up?

[21:01:07] <kailo> I thought that was built into the kernel, hmm
[21:01:47] <kailo> let's take a step back.. do I need to do any other partitions on sda to successfully find /boot with uefi?  or is a single partition of type ext2 sufficient?

[21:08:10] <MacGyver> You're conflating concepts and have it the wrong way around.

[23:51:58] <catbehemoth> git fails with "sed: can't read requirements.txt: No such file or directory"
[23:53:02] <susi> one lil question.. I have a file with qemu-system-x86_64 .... line, if I execute it with `sed 2\!d file` it gives "qemu-system-x86_64: -hda /dev/sda: Could not open '/dev/sda': Permission denied", but if I do sh -c `sed 2\!d file`, no that error and it starts a machine.. why's this?
[23:54:13] <susi> yet if I run `sh` and type the same qemu.. command there, the same 'permission denied' error (as it should)
