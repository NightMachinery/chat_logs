[00:30:49] <Jacques> https://i.imgur.com/hsxIvSO.png like this
[00:30:50] <Jacques> Generally, I am finding it difficult to write the function.. So I think I need a 1/x^2 term to make the vertical asymptote.
[00:31:03] <Jacques> then maybe something with e^x

[00:39:16] <mornfall> then you can deal with each convenient interval separately and combine them using ↑ without compromising smoothness (assuming you want the result to be smooth, not just continuous)
[00:39:43] <W> Jacques, you didn't specify any other parameters, so something like (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)/x/e^x would meet what you wrote

[00:44:44] <Jacques> ohhh I get it
[00:45:29] <Jacques> my version was -ln(x)(x-3) / e^x
[00:45:46] <Jacques> er, with one hump
[00:46:24] <Jacques> but it works in a similar way: ln(x) to give the asymptote, (x-3) to give the hump, and division by e^x to yield the zero at infinity
[00:48:39] <W> there are many ways to go about this kind of task, if you want more control over the extrema you could go for something like hermite interpolation, and adjust some a such that /e^(x+a) squashes the polynomial far enough out

[00:49:41] <W> well e^x dominates most polynomials, right? you just want it to dominate for x larger than where your critical points are
[00:49:59] <W> i.e. larger than some a
[00:50:06] <W> *dominates all polynomials
[00:50:10] <Jacques> ah ah
[00:52:50] <W> I guess minus a rather than plus a, if I word it like that "larger than some a"
[00:53:45] <W> probably the best approach is backwards from what we've discussed; find your asymptote dominating parts (log and exp, say), then find what the value would be at the critical points you want, and plug those values into the hermite interpolation too, so you get exactly the values you want

[03:59:07] <PlanckWalk> ∨ is used more in logic.

[04:05:52] <PlanckWalk> Just due to the particular example I used though
[04:06:55] <PlanckWalk> It's not really close to "and" in  {f(x) | x in D}
[04:07:49] <energizer> sure it is
[04:08:00] <PlanckWalk> "The set of all f(x) and x in D"?
[04:08:18] <PlanckWalk> f(x) isn't even a predicate
[04:08:49] <energizer> yeah it is
[04:09:10] <PlanckWalk> The thing to the left of the | isn't really supposed to be a predicate, it just has the form of one in some particular circumstances.
[04:09:42] <PlanckWalk> In {x in R | x^2 > 2}, it isn't really a predicate.  It's merely specifying the set to which a predicate is applied.
[04:10:10] <PlanckWalk> "The elements of R that satisfy the predicate to the right"
[04:10:50] <energizer> that is short for {y such that forall x, x in D and y = f(x)}

[04:12:56] <PlanckWalk> I mean, yes you can, but it's not what the expression *means*

[04:14:35] <energizer> is there some formal differece between "exists x such that x < 2" and "exists x and x < 2"
[04:14:52] <PlanckWalk> Well, the big one is that the latter is not valid grammar
[04:15:20] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, that's not quite true
[04:15:38] <PlanckWalk> "exists x and x < 2" is grammatically valid.
[04:15:45] <PlanckWalk> It just means something completely different.
[04:15:59] <isekaijin> Even in ordinary English, “and” and “such that” don't mean the same thing, and they aren't even the same kind of part of speech.
[04:16:15] <energizer> s/even/only/
[04:16:30] <PlanckWalk> Grammatically, it's  (exists x) and (x < 2), where the first clause is just asserting that something exists in the domain of discourse, and the second clause talks about properties of some free variable x.
[04:16:37] <isekaijin> “And” is a conjunction, but “such that” is not.
[04:16:50] *** Quits: osoba (~me@77.105.51.105) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:17:01] <isekaijin> “Such that” is more akin to a relative pronoun like “where”.

[04:17:31] *** Quits: blueberrycrop (~blueberry@209.222.169.22) (Quit: Client closed)
[04:17:37] <PlanckWalk> So I could say:  if x = 3 then "exists x and x < 2" is false.
[04:18:03] <PlanckWalk> But:  if x = 3 then "exists x such that x < 2" is true.
[04:18:29] <PlanckWalk> Because in the latter case, the "inner" x is a completely independent bound variable.
[04:18:35] <isekaijin> But, in any case, | certainly doesn't mean “and” in math.
[04:18:37] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[04:19:04] <PlanckWalk> The same sort of distinction exists in {x in R | x^2 < 2}.  The x is bound there.
[04:19:13] <PlanckWalk> ("R" isn't)
[04:20:22] <PlanckWalk> Something like  {x in R and x^2 < 2}  is technically nonsense, but someone might generously interpret it to mean {x in R | x^2 < 2}
[04:21:44] <PlanckWalk> It they weren't so generous, they'd see "x in R and x^2 < 2" is a logical expression.  So this set is either the set {True} or {False}.
[04:21:53] <PlanckWalk> (Depending upon the values of x and R)
[04:22:07] <dude12312414> lol
[04:22:29] <greenbagels> I feel like in practice most people would interpret it the first way
[04:22:49] <greenbagels> formality aside
[04:22:54] <PlanckWalk> Yes, because most people try to make sense of what they read and make allowances for deficiencies of the writer.
[04:23:03] <energizer> there are probably many ways to interpret such expressions that make sense, i dont think there are rankings of interpretations' goodness
[04:23:47] <greenbagels> energizer: in this case you wouldn't read | as "and", you'd read it as "such that"
[04:24:20] <energizer> sure, that's an option
[04:24:28] <PlanckWalk> It's not really an option.
[04:24:41] <PlanckWalk> It's the standard meaning of the notation.
[04:24:56] <isekaijin> ^
[04:25:33] <energizer> i'm not denying it's the standard interpretation. but i dont think it's the only possibly sensible one
[04:25:47] <isekaijin> Using “and” wouldn't make sense anyway, because you want the elements of sets to be arbitrary mathematical objects, but the arguments of “and” can only be propositions.
[04:26:03] <greenbagels> or at the very least, two objects on equal footing
[04:26:18] <isekaijin> Okay, two elements of a Boolean or Heyting algebra or something like that.
[04:26:51] <greenbagels> like maybe once in a blue moon you might see someone use "and" as short for "and, therefore..." but it doesnt really make it... a good idea
[04:27:28] <isekaijin> But, in set builder notation, we use {shape of typical element | extra conditions on the free variables in the aforementioned shape}.
[04:27:47] <dogbert2> All MIT students, regardless of intended major, must pass two semesters of calculus, plus two semesters of calculus-based physics [...]. The substance and pace of these courses are both very demanding, and they culminate in long, challenging final exams that students must pass to proceed with their education.
[04:28:01] <dogbert2> impressive...
[04:28:29] <PlanckWalk> Yes, there are many possible sensible assignments of meaning to notation.  Infinitely many, probably.  That doesn't mean that you can just pick any old thing and expect to communicate with it when others are using a different one.

[05:59:55] <Fangs> isekaijin: this num theory course is just a course in commutative algebra so far
[06:00:04] <isekaijin> vin: If you have a function of several variables f(x1,...,xn), the gradient is the vector of partial derivatives: (∂f/∂x1, ..., ∂f/∂xn).
[06:00:32] <vin>  Ahah why would you want that?
[06:00:34] <isekaijin> vin: But if you haven't taken multivariable calculus, then my approach isn't going to work. You're going to have to use Fangs' more geometric suggestion. (Which ultimately boils down to the same thing.)
[06:00:58] <isekaijin> vin: The critical points of a differentiable function are precisely those where the gradient is the zero vector.
[06:01:00] <Fangs> I think they have, they are following you so far

[06:07:02] <tusko> I made a continous waveform, took a bunch of samples from it (i.e. xs(t)). Then I multiplied the Fourier matrix by that column vector of samples on the right.
[06:07:41] <tusko> Y = F*xs(t), so I should have Y, but then Y is in the frequency domain and so I don't know what to plot Y on

[09:05:07] <isekaijin> vin: The point to regularization is to penalize solutions that are too large.
[09:06:14] <isekaijin> So, in ordinary least squares, you just want the closest thing to a solution to Ax = b.
[09:06:51] <isekaijin> But, in regularized least squares, you want to strike a balance between “being close to a solution of Ax = b” and “having a solution that isn't too large”.

[09:09:38] <vin> isekaijin: probably when you want to find solutions with tradeoffs. Example, buy a product that is not too costly or not too bad in quality
[09:09:54] <isekaijin> But how does regularization model that?
[09:09:55] <vin> I think it can give a sort of pareto effect
[09:10:16] <isekaijin> Regularization simply penalizes solutions whose norm is too large.
[09:10:27] <isekaijin> But why are solutions with large norm undesirable?
[09:10:52] *** Joins: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[09:11:26] <isekaijin> For ordinary least squares, the goal is clear. We want the data to support a hypthesis that y = mx + b, where m is a row vector and x is a column vector.
[09:11:47] <isekaijin> So we model it as y = mx + b + e, where e is an error term, and we want to minimize the sum of squares of the e's.
[09:12:44] <isekaijin> This works particularly nicely under the assumption that x and y are jointly normally distributed.
[09:13:13] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:13:41] <isekaijin> We want to find the linear combination mx + b (remember, m is a row vector and x is a column vector) which is maximally correlated wtih y.
[09:14:07] <isekaijin> But is there a similar sensible explanation for regularization?
[09:14:31] *** Quits: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[09:15:20] <vin> I am working on a problem where I use minimum normalization as regularization to identify if a boat can go close to a set of waypoints while minimizing fuel required.
[09:15:58] <isekaijin> To be honest, my impression is that, when things start getting too complicated, statisticians are a little bit willing to do things for which there might be no theoretical justification, besides “it looks simple”. They aren't as bad as ML people in this regard, though.
[09:15:59] <vin> So regularized least squares with an appropriate \lambda value will allow me to solve for that
[09:16:14] <isekaijin> Oh.
[09:16:26] *** Joins: wonko-the-sane (~wonk-the-@gateway/tor-sasl/wonko-the-sane)
[09:16:52] <isekaijin> Okay, in that case regularization is justified - you indeed want to strike a balance between “getting close to the waypoints” and “minimizing the fuel requirement”.
[09:17:03] <vin> Yup!
[09:17:32] <isekaijin> But the use cases that I saw in practice were just “I don't want my regression coefficients to be too large”.
[09:17:47] <isekaijin> And I was like “what's the problem with the regression coefficients being too large?”
[09:17:51] <vin> This can be done without regularization as well  but looks like the model is simpler with it (which translates to smaller memory and compute footprint)
[09:19:01] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: Client closed)
[09:19:06] <isekaijin> Honestly, I still think identifying the fuel usage with a constant multiple of |x|^2 is a little bit too rough a model.
[09:19:22] <isekaijin> But if it works, it works.

[10:28:38] <Fangs> isomorphisms are group hom f: G -> H that are invertible, in the sense that there is some F: H -> G such that G --f--> H --F--> G just gives you the identity.. so F(f(g)) = g, and ofc f(F(h)) = h
[10:28:46] <Fangs> you dont need to really know all this
[10:29:23] <Fangs> smlckz: so turns out, if two groups are isomorphic.. meaning f : G -> H is an isomorphism, then order of the element g and f(g) has to be the same
[10:30:38] <Fangs> smlckz: that line is the important bit^... so if you can find an element in either Z/pZ x Z/pZ or Z/(p^2)Z that has some order but no element in the other group has that order, you've showed that they are not 'isomorphic'
[10:32:20] <Fangs> the reason being, if x is in one group has order idk.. "n", but no element in the other group has order n.. then there is no way to map x to the other group that gives an isomorphism
[10:33:19] <Fangs> I'll stop there for now, think thats a lot to digest

[13:11:51] <Xardas> It's also stated that a graph that is symmetric with respect to the y-axis cannot be increasing on its entire domain.
[13:12:05] <Xardas> this truly makes no sense

[13:18:31] <alphamule> Forget your geometric intuitions
[13:18:40] <alphamule> Imagine you're reading it left to right
[13:18:56] <alphamule> Reading the numbers out in that order, and comparing.
[13:19:04] <alphamule> 9 is definitely less than 16
[13:19:14] <alphamule> 4 is less than 9
[13:19:29] <alphamule> It's coming down from infinity
[13:19:53] <alphamule> Then because it's even, it flips growth at 0
[13:20:00] <alphamule> And now it's increasing
[13:20:22] <Fangs> Xardas: graph-wise a function is only increasing when it goes from bottom left to upper right
[13:20:30] <Fangs> and decreasing when its going from top left to bottom right
[13:20:40] <alphamule> i.e. The slope is >0
[13:21:41] <alphamule> Imagine you're climbing uphill... walking backwards j/k
[13:22:06] <alphamule> The chirality/symmetry analogies...
[13:22:39] <Xardas> oh my bad
[13:23:57] <Xardas> It's decreasing on (-infinity,0] and increasing on [0,infinity)
[13:24:08] <Xardas> so it's not increasing on it's ENTIRE domain

[16:40:58] <smlckz> Fangs: and in general for any b in N

[16:42:23] <smlckz> Fangs: yes
[16:43:14] <isekaijin> Anyhow, I've always thought of carrying as a sort of “twisting”. So, polynomial addition isn't twisted (if you add two monomials of degree n, the result is again a monomial of degree n, there's no “spillover” into higher degrees), but integer addition (in any base) is.
[16:43:18] <Fangs> now, instead, you want to find a function f: Z/2Z x Z/2Z -> Z/2Z to 'twist' the addition we normally how

This means that we can do integer arithmetic (both addition and multiplication) consider only the least n significant digits and then consider the limit when n -> 0.
[17:41:13] <isekaijin> However, if we want to do this for the fractional parts, we can also reconstruct addition “one decimal place at a time”, but not multiplication.
[17:42:06] <isekaijin> Because the product of two numbers with n decimal places is a number with 2n decimal places.

[17:52:33] <river> but i don't mean to derail the discussion
[17:57:26] <smlckz> is there a concise and compact way to say that finite digits constraint?
[17:59:08] <river> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics)
[17:59:10] <river> finite support
[17:59:30] <river> are you familiar with X^2 being isomorphic to {0,1} -> X
[18:00:04] <river> in general X^n is iso to n -> X,   including infinity.
[18:00:30] <Fangs> on that page you'd need X = N the natural numbers and f: N -> Z instead of to the reals
[18:01:49] <Fangs> smlckz: river is just talking about how an 'indexed' object is a function from the naturals to a particular object
[18:02:16] <Fangs> (x1,x2,x3,...,xn), think of this as x: {1,...,n} such that x(i) = xi
[18:02:22] <river> i bring up this isomorphism because the def. of finite support is on functions, so it's useful to see how (Z/bZ)^oo is a function
[18:02:25] <smlckz> Fangs: okay
[18:02:56] <Fangs> I think theres a haskell way to say this.. x: N -> Z/bZ

[19:24:41] <isekaijin> Is there a “maximal radical extension of Q”?
[19:25:01] <Z-module> sure
[19:25:11] <Z-module> The "radical" complex numbers
[19:25:19] <isekaijin> That is, consider the subset Qrad of Qbar defined by Qrad = { x \in Qbar | Q(x) / Q is a radical extension }. Is Qrad a field?
[19:25:28] <isekaijin> Oh.

[19:26:25] <Z-module> Start with Q, now adjoin all nth roots of everything in Q (all natural n) to get F_1. Now take F_1 and do the same procedure to get F_2. etc etc., and now the union of all these F_n is it.
[19:26:52] <isekaijin> Oh, good.
[19:27:12] <isekaijin> Then implementing arithmetic in this subfield of Qbar (on a computer) seems easier than implementing arithmetic on all of Qbar.

[19:29:51] <isekaijin> Mmm, wait.
[19:30:14] <isekaijin> I was thinking we could do something like “let x^(1/n) be the n-th root of x whose argument in [0,2pi) is closest to 0”.
[19:30:27] <isekaijin> But then implementing addition and subtraction is hard.
[19:31:21] <isekaijin> What I want to do is just find the largest subfield of Qbar whose implementation on a computer (using exact arithmetic) is braindead easy.
[19:31:31] <river> well
[19:31:48] <river> i think the simplest technique is to use a pair (integer polynomial, decimal approximation)
[19:32:15] <river> the approximation only needs to be accurate enough to disambiguate, that allows you to make it arbitrarily more accurate on request
[19:32:15] <isekaijin> That only works if you're willing to compute those decimal approximations using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
[19:32:36] <isekaijin> But I wanted to avoid those long computations in the first place.
[19:32:58] <river> they aren't necessarily long computations, only if two roots of a polynomial are very very close together will you need more than e.g. 3 digits
[19:33:33] <isekaijin> Yeah, but I'm talking about exact computation for arbitrary operations in the whole field.
[19:33:47] <river> this is exact, even though it is based on approximations
[19:33:54] <isekaijin> Yes, I know.
[19:34:03] <river> anyway it seems you do not like my idea
[19:34:22] <isekaijin> The problem is that I don't want the operations to be fast “for most elements”, but rather “for all elements”.
[19:34:49] <isekaijin> If I have to use arbitrary precision arithmetic as a failback for whatever reasons, then I've lost already.

[19:39:22] <river> yes
[19:39:35] <river> because of closure
[19:40:00] <isekaijin> Okay, that's a lower bound for the size of a field extension of Q admitting braindead easy implementations.
[19:40:57] <isekaijin> But it's pretty disappointing.
[19:41:17] <isekaijin> It doesn't even have all constructible numbers, I think.
[19:42:02] <Z-module> indeed not

[22:35:20] *** Quits: unknow (~i.am@user/marlboro) (Quit: a pentium 100 "running" windows 11 trying to play Last of Us II at ps4emu... that's my brain trying understand 0->R->R->R/2R->0)
[22:35:20] <snake> its impressive, but not as entertaining as the political drama of MGS :)
[22:35:22] <mycroftiv> mornfall: using forcing techniques from cohen in combination with perceptual filtering
[22:35:24] <mornfall> mycroftiv: but the first half, i'd play :)
[22:35:57] <mycroftiv> mornfall: its structured as a partial binary hypercube of the yi jing so its totally nonlinear
[22:37:01] <mycroftiv> i accidentally started a religion called New Protocol because i got so overworked during the creation process i destroyed my family and going not-not-savior seemed like the best way to proceed
[22:37:31] <snake> its like the trend is to make a game simulation so realistic that you could go into a VR world and just live in the game. like come on lets leave a little bit of experience to the real world :P
[22:37:56] <mycroftiv> well dont you want choice of what layer you are at?
[22:38:12] <snake> you talking to me?
[22:38:23] <mycroftiv> yes :)
[22:39:10] <snake> i'd choose reality, just like in naruto, where madara uchiha wanted to cast infinite tsukoyomi (dream world jutsu) on everyone in the world by reflecting his sharingan off the moon

[22:39:53] <snake> and naruto and the entire first world shinobi army union fought to protect our bonds between each other
[22:40:02] <snake> you can have whatever you want in the dream world, but its not real
[22:40:14] <mycroftiv> what if everyone gets that same chance if they want, and then all the subcopies can higher merge - or not - iteratively, and every possibility happens in every world that has a story worth telling?
[22:40:30] <snake> parsing error
[22:40:36] <snake> gonna finish my late math assignment
[22:40:45] <mycroftiv> not when expressed in formal mathematics of infinite sets...
[22:41:12] <snake> oop i accidentally closed it
[22:41:23] <snake> well i think i get how to do that anyways so whatever
[22:41:28] <mycroftiv> but people find it easier to speak philosophy than read 20,000+ lines of agda and stuff that i do to try to explain it all
[22:41:29] <snake> thanks everyone
[22:41:47] <mycroftiv> peace yo

[23:34:13] <quartz> Damn, what a shame.
[23:35:29] <mornfall> not the place to discuss this, but seems that freenode.net has become a front for some job marketplace?
[23:35:29] <mornfall> seems dead, in any case
[23:35:42] <specing> this is freenode in all but name
[23:35:46] <specing> same staff
