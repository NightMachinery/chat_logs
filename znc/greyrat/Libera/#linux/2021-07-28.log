[03:55:30] <hi^-^> beltwaybob, by the way, our ancestors did eat a lot of vegetable, you do need fiber and vitamin k to be healthy and vegetables are how you get them. (along with all those other vitamins that are not exclusively in veggies and antioxydants and more) a lot of vegeterian food (lentil etc) has more protein than meat, and vitamin b12 is the only exclusive reason you need meat/egg/dairy.

[03:55:47] <tusko> Psi-Jack is like that dude who got no play all through college and now takes it out on others by harshing their buzz

[03:56:36] <beltwaybob> hi^-^: Vitamin K is produced in the gut in substantial amounts, as menaquinone, the production varies hugely from person to person. And some of the productive bacteria require heme iron

[04:29:03] <beltwaybob> hi^-^: no, most populations are agrarian, e.g. feudal serfs in Europe, similar serfs in China/India's caste system.  Indigenous Americans and Australians (and a few other pockets) are the people who have retained human customs in the face of agriculture and church and other nonsense.
[04:29:12] <Psi-Jack> beltwaybob: Seriously...
[04:29:21] <Psi-Jack> There's an offtopic channel for this crap.
[04:29:23] <tusko> UK really screwed India up bigly
[04:29:49] <beltwaybob> tusko: all of these places were already screwed up by agriculture. At least the British Elites ate a good amount of meat, they just fed grains to their peasants.
[04:30:05] *** Joins: upsala (~zcb@185.213.155.160)
[04:30:26] <Psi-Jack> So, anyone have a linux question this evening?
[04:30:27] <tusko> beltwaybob, are you sure agriculture is the problem so much as monoculture is the problem?
[04:30:39] <hi^-^> beltwaybob, other people going by that logic are why those nations also set population increase policies despite all the problems.
[04:30:49] <GNUtoo> Hi, I've that when trying to use gpiomon: "gpiomon: error waiting for events: No such device", do I need to add something special in my dts? I've used gpio-aggregator, and only specified the GPIOs and the pinmux. Do I need to add some IRQs or something like that?
[04:31:03] <beltwaybob> tusko: yes, I am certain, it's simply too many calories and too little nutrition, so you get half-formed people---it's literally in the skeletal record, we literally see it when you have indigenous populations put onto grain diets, they get sickly.
[04:31:15] <Dagmar> tusko: WEll, of course.  That's why everyone's so hot and bothered to get to Mars.  It's in great shape because there's absolutely no agriculture.

[04:31:16] <Psi-Jack> GNUtoo: Hmmmm, RaspberryPi eh?
[04:31:22] <beltwaybob> tusko: Agriculture almost inevitably comes with a religious caste system where the underfed peasants are told they're in some "karmic wheel of reincarnation" or that it's "god's will" that they be sickly.
[04:31:45] <beltwaybob> The other issue is that agriculture may have been precipitated by alcohol brewing, and alcohol is  apotent neurotoxin
[04:31:58] <GNUtoo> Psi-Jack: it's a beaglebone black, but it use a kernel based on upstream Linux (it's linux-libre)
[04:32:14] <Psi-Jack> Ahhh, that's pretty specific. ðŸ™‚
[04:32:59] <GNUtoo> I've looked a bit in Documentation/devicetree/bindings but I didn't find what to do yet

[04:33:41] <hi^-^> beltwaybob, meat industry is responsible for like 51% of our emission and a lot of deforestation happens because of it, and a lot of agriculture happens to feed the cattle that mostly turn it to poop and don't bring back much food from it.
[04:33:55] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, I don't have any experience with a Beaglebone myself. And haven't noticed much conversation here regarding it before.
[04:34:00] <hi^-^> industrial activity is a factor, population increase is also a factor.
[04:34:25] <beltwaybob> Right, it's those people running coal-burning smokestacks in their backyard for fun, it's not to support population increases made possible by agriculture :P
[04:34:25] <GNUtoo> Psi-Jack: it's not specific to a board, it's more specific to the devicetree used by Linux
[04:34:59] <GNUtoo> Psi-Jack: for instance that could also apply to a MIPS WiFi access point as Linux support thoses too with the devicetree
[04:35:29] <hi^-^> but if we want to do anything, we most start from ourselves, and doing what we can, "it's mostly population increase and that is not because of me" helps nobody.

[07:07:18] <Gustavo6046> Intel, you handicap yourselves, and the technology you KNOW you have and you KNOW costs about nothing to add to the manufacture of chips, in the name of profits. Instead of adding less cores to low- and mid-line processors, you just strip us of even moderately newish SIMD and other CPU extensions, leaving those just for the highest bidders; and when the performance starts to get NOTICEABLY bad,
[07:07:20] <Gustavo6046> Intel, you just overclock the hell out of your processors. Which is fine; everyone knows CPU clock speed is directly proportional to performance! Just another one of your misleading marketing tactics that everyone bought into for the better part of two, nay, three decades. Not to mention your absolute dogshite benchmarks that nobody could have possibly believed in in the first place. For all of
[07:07:23] <Gustavo6046> this, Intel, I suffer on a daily basis; maybe it's the fact I live in the third world and get but a fraction of the material assets an equivalent average American would have in youthhood, but I know, Intel, I know at least YOU didn't have to be stingy like this. But no, you play the Mr. Krabs card until the end. You had no reason to. Your initial public offering is the biggest downward spiral that
[07:07:24] <Gustavo6046> has ever happened to the computer world, maybe even worse than the video game market crash of the 80s. I hate you, Intel.

[08:47:00] <ViperXL75> But since I know now that strongswan is included, i'll just drop Openswan and go strongswan. :)
[08:47:24] <kwilczynski> ViperXL75: If you don't have any specific and/or strong requirement for IPSec, then consider using WireGuard. It's so much nicer, more performant and easier to set up. Plus already in the mainline kernel for a while.

[08:51:43] <kwilczynski> ViperXL75: Also, the performance of this tiny CPU is not amazing when you add encryption atop of it (and you already use DPI and such).
[08:52:16] <ViperXL75> yeah in this case it's fine
[08:52:20] <Dagmar> ViperXL75: You can definitely do it with a pi and strongswan or freeswan or openswan
[08:52:20] <kwilczynski> ViperXL75: WireGuard is doable there, see for example: https://gist.github.com/pamolloy/059c552b814b0dddfcdc0cec2bbe5872

[18:30:50] <Psi-Jack> Alright, back, had a meeting to attend.
[18:31:02] <Dagmar> archie: Like, explicitly forbidden by RFC even
[18:31:13] <Dagmar> This should _not_ pose a problem for anyone
[18:31:28] <Psi-Jack> archie: Here's a question. Is /someone/ trying to use a regular DNS server to have <theirname>.local as a domain name?
[18:31:32] <archie> Dagmar but in my case it can't be resolved with mDNS, it's a private address in VPN
[18:31:37] <Dagmar> If it's posing a problem, then honestly someone's using .local wrong and needs to correct that before they get burned
[18:31:48] <p3rL> chmod 750 /home/* < fixed the problem ... same thing i need to do with /var/www ?
[18:31:58] <akik> p3rL: change the HOME_MODE in /etc/login.defs to 0700 also
[18:32:02] <Dagmar> archie: mDNS is supposed to _only_ have the scope of the local broadcast domain
[18:32:08] <Psi-Jack> If someone us using theirname.local as a domain in a regular DNS Zone, THEY NEED TO STOP NOW!
[18:32:12] <Dagmar> i.e., .local addresses _should not_ resolve across a VPN
[18:32:12] <p3rL> akik ok
[18:32:33] <akik> p3rL: but i'm not sure why you use 750 if you don't want other users to access other people's home dirs
[18:32:43] <Dagmar> One of the many "hints" is the "m" in "mDNS" which stands for "multicast"
[18:32:44] <archie> Psi-Jack someone is, but in a VPN, nothing is public

[18:34:52] <Psi-Jack> archie: They need to stop.
[18:34:58] <Dagmar> `chmod 700 /home` will break your system.  `chmod 700 /home/*` will simply remove group and other rights from the individual homedirs
[18:35:17] <akik> p3rL: i think ubuntu changed this system when they started creating a separate group for each user with the same name
[18:35:22] <Dagmar> archie: Lack of broadcast scope across the VPN link, for opne
[18:35:24] <Psi-Jack> archie: .local is literally /reserved/ for mDNS, use of it as a regular DNS zone on regular DNS servers, WILL RESULT IN MAJOR ISSUES.

[19:01:13] <Dagmar> The worst-case scenario there is that maybe the newer firmware sucks in which case you just roll back the package and reboot
[19:02:47] <coconut> Dagmar, no not linux-firmware but the real firmware inside the hardware,,,
[19:03:23] <Dagmar> coconut: Well, system76 aren't some vendor on Alibaba and they've been around for awhile, but asking for 100% guarantee fails to recognize the nature of the equipment being worked with
[19:03:30] <akk> I was under the impression that fwupdmgr flashes firmware to various components (on a lenovo).
[19:03:30] <Dagmar> _No_ flashing procedure is 100% reliable

[19:03:53] <akk> (doesn't just put files in place) but maybe that impression was wrong
[19:04:02] <Dagmar> This is why manufs always get a little worked up about the verbiage telling you to not flash unless you're experiencing a problem a newer firmware solves.
[19:04:24] <Dagmar> If 10,000 people reflash their firmware, odds are that 5-6 of them are going to have problems and maybe 1-2 of the devices are going to need to be shipped back

[20:11:27] <Psi-Jack> Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Fedora (or Fedora KDE Spin), or openSUSE, are the only distros I recommend to a newbie.
[20:11:38] <Psi-Jack> And NEVER would I recommend arch to a newbie.
[20:11:42] <Dagmar> Debian targets a _stable_ platform, meaning they only patch the software they've already shipped to increase stability

[20:15:33] <uwharrie> opensuse is like 1.1 and arch is like 1.2 and 1.2 is always better than 1.1
