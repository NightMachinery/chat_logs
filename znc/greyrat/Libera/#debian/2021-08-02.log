[01:44:16] <jhutchins> Most professionals prefer to do a clean install for a new release anyway, RPM or DEB.

[01:50:40] <PMT> Sure, but RHEL wasn't the question, RPM distros were.
[01:50:51] <jhutchins> The problem with deferred upgrades is that the community knowledge of the little glitches starts to fade, and if you're two releases back trying to crawl you way forward, nobody remembers why dovecot won't start.

[01:51:33] <n4dir> in such cases i'd probably just reinstall too
[01:51:56] <PMT> Most of the times I've had that go poorly, I did something unfortunate like swapping out core system packages with my own builds.
[01:52:02] <n4dir> on the powerpc i could only upgrade from (i think) old-stable straight to sid. I was astonished it worked

[02:46:43] <PMT> Let's try short circuiting this with a request as unambiguous as possible. "Please put no_root_squash in the /etc/exports line, which I think would look like /export/media 10.11.12.0/24(fsid=1,ro,no_root_squash,subtree_check,insecure) for you, then pastebin literally every command and output between saving and closing the text editor and you concluding it didn't help"
[02:47:09] <Razva> Ok, doing that.

[02:50:41] <Razva> is that correct?
[02:51:16] *** Quits: luuuciano_ (~luuuciano@user/luuuciano) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[02:51:56] <Razva> Added result from `exportfs -v` as well: https://paste.debian.net/1206286/
[02:52:37] <PMT> Okay. That seems reasonable. What about after that?
[02:53:06] <Razva> On the target I'm doing `mount 10.11.12.4:/export/media /nfs/media/`. Is that correct?
[02:53:23] <PMT> Seems reasonable. Is it already mounted?
[02:53:31] <Razva> Ok. It's working.
[02:53:48] * Razva facepalms
[02:54:18] <Razva> I already did `no_root_squash` without success, but I guess I didn't restarted the service or I did something wrong.
[02:54:28] <Razva> Thank you for your *huge* patience!

[02:59:44] <Razva> Yup, it's working, just `fstab`ed it and it works after `mount -a`. Thank you again!

[03:09:17] <Razva> next to the SMB shares, what would be a good way to mount it without specifying the pass in plain-text?
[03:10:04] <Razva> reading this: https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Mounting_samba_shares_from_a_unix_client but still, it requires the password in plain text

[03:22:43] <NiLon> Razva best you can do is using credentials file and then make sure file is readable only by limited parties
[03:23:01] <PMT> Razva: I don't recall if I have ever had occasion to use it in practice, but I believe your two options for Samba mounting are "plaintext credentials somewhere, even if only root can read them" and "Kerberos"
[03:23:19] <Razva> yeah, I guess that doing `600` is the "fix".

[13:24:19] <dpkg> deb.debian.org is a mirror network that is backed by international content delivery networks and for most users, this is the most reliable <mirror> to use in the <sources.list>. From Debian 9 "Stretch" onwards, apt queries SRV records in DNS which then send it off to a CDN. Older apt will get an HTTP redirect from deb.debian.org to the same CDNs. See http://deb.debian.org/ for more details.

[19:50:16] <PMT> hegemoOn: before you came in, someone also came in to report that and request the nonworking mirror be removed from the rotation. You may also find using, say, deb.debian.org more effective going forward.
[19:50:21] <PMT> !deb.debian.org
[19:50:22] <dpkg> deb.debian.org is a mirror network that is backed by international content delivery networks and for most users, this is the most reliable <mirror> to use in the <sources.list>. From Debian 9 "Stretch" onwards, apt queries SRV records in DNS which then send it off to a CDN. Older apt will get an HTTP redirect from deb.debian.org to the same CDNs. See http://deb.debian.org/ for more details.
[19:54:47] <jelly> hegemoOn, we have a similar number of debian servers at work and it wasn't too hard to make ansible working.  Fixing sources.list on all of them then actually becomes a finger swing

[19:57:27] <jhutchins> hegemoOn: 200 isn't a huge base, but you might want to set up a local, internal mirror.  This allows you to lock down the production servers rather than giving them random internet access.
[19:59:22] <hegemoOn> well there is third way

[23:45:30] <PMT> I wonder why it didn't report that in the detection. Does it lump them together?
[23:45:48] <PMT> I think I find that surprising.
[23:46:21] <PMT> I'm guessing from that forum topic that the undocumented setting there only exists in newer sddm?
[23:47:32] <greycat> Yes, I checked the source code on github.  The option is NOT in the stretch version (0.14.0) but IS in the buster version (0.18.0) albeit undocumented and defaulting to false.
[23:47:52] <greycat> Apparently it defaults to true in the current github version.
[23:48:06] <PMT> Oh, I see, I would guess it doesn't resolve builddeps for the dependencies too, just sees that they're available. Do you need to rebuild everything?
[23:48:09] <greycat> Now where the fuck is debhelper >= 11 supposed to come from....

[23:48:56] <greycat> am I supposed to have lines for both stretch-backports *and* stretch-backports-sloppy?  the instructions say to use the -sloppy one "instead"
[23:49:08] <PMT> Which instructions?

[23:50:58] <greycat> and if I put both in sources.list and try to install debhelper from stretch-backports, it wants to remove cmake

[23:53:02] <PMT> greycat: I think that line is saying "the difference in using s-b-s is that you use a different sources.list line" (e.g. the obvious difference) not "do not put both lines in", but I could be wrong, I haven't used -sloppy much. 
[23:53:17] <PMT> Why does it want to remove cmake?
[23:53:27] <greycat> I'm still trying to find a combo that lets me install the god damned build dependenceis
[23:53:59] <greycat> the version of cmake in -sloppy depends on libarchive13 3.0.something rather than 3.3.0 something.  the version of cmake in -backports wants libarchive13 3.3.3

[23:55:16] <sney> whenever I need to backport something that has some non-trivial dependency mess, I do it in a local vm that I don't mind trashing with nonstandard workarounds, and then move only the resulting deb
[23:55:18] <PMT> I may be blind, but I don't see a cmake in s-b-s, just one in s-b?
[23:55:46] <greycat> ok, maybe it fell back to the stretch version of cmake
