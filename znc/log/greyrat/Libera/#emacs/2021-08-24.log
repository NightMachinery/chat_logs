[00:49:49] <hodapp> 'highlighted' can also be a little vague, e.g. if you can set a mark and deal with a range of text, does that count as highlighting?
[00:51:04] <carbonfiber> highlighted means visually highlighted. so visually changed somehow.
[00:54:37] <rpav> how recently did emacs even _get_ 'hilighting' vs mark/point
[00:55:00] <rpav> i thought the transient mark or whatever was post-xemacs stuff
[00:55:15] <carbonfiber> hmm. no idea.

[03:01:44] <edgar-rft> johnjay: I din't want to say that I think Common Lisp is in all regards better than MacLisp. But significant differences are that Common Lisp supports lexical binding, has separate readtables per package, and has a separate namespace for keyword symbols. Lexical binding and keyword arguments are only available in Emacs since RMS stepped down as the main Emacs maintainer.

[09:02:25] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am more worried that an installed package will try to auto install missing deps
[09:02:57] <alphapapa[m]> that would be a very badly behaved package if it did that.  MELPA wouldn't publish a package that did that

[09:03:26] <Spawns_Carpeting> so in general packages wont try to do that?
[09:03:29] <Spawns_Carpeting> thats good to know
[09:03:41] <alphapapa[m]> Package dependencies are defined in the package headers and are installed by the package system when a package is installed, not at runtime later.

[09:04:15] <parsnip> codingquark: i guess there were several main ideas. protein makes you feel fuller. Atwater forgot to account for energy spent metabolising, for calories on packaging. Avoiding ultraprocessed foods can be a sign of privilege.
[09:04:20] *** Joins: countvajhula (~user@c-76-102-157-149.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[09:04:22] <parsnip> i think i forgot a couple ideas
[09:04:54] <parsnip> but all the details were great, and the speaker is not a boring person, has a sense of humor at times
[09:04:56] <Spawns_Carpeting> i end up installing most of my packages through the systems package manager. it does something to provide them to emacs with the site-gentoo.el file
[09:05:08] <codingquark> I'll try squeezing it in today, it is long hence kind of tough to schedule
[09:06:23] <alphapapa[m]> Spawns_Carpeting: If you like giving Gentoo control over your Emacs config, that can be useful.  Usually that sort of thing works fine, but sometimes it can cause problems.  I once had a very hard problem to debug caused by distro-level packages being out-of-date and conflicting with newer packages.
[09:06:52] <parsnip> honestly dieting and weight loss aren't exactly my main focus yet, i'd like to see how heart rate as a target works for me, hopefully it will help me with some fat loss without too much diet effort... though i've seen people say cardio without diet just causes you to be hungry enough to keep up with calories
[09:06:56] <alphapapa[m]> Since Emacs is like an OS unto itself, I don't see any advantage in doing that.
[09:07:34] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: You can undo a whole exercise session's worth of burned calories with one small snack.  Diet is the way to lose weight and fat.
[09:07:52] <Spawns_Carpeting> are the emacs repos like melpa pretty safe in terms of people not being able to upload malware elisp?
[09:07:58] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: And increasing BMR is the other way, i.e. building muscle mass.
[09:08:05] <Spawns_Carpeting> i know elpa is pretty safe, or at least i think it is

[09:08:18] <parsnip> yeah i think Jeff Nippard references a guy who ate more calories in one hour than he could burn in an entire day of maximal effort calorie burning

[09:08:51] <codingquark> Spawns_Carpeting: I don't think the code is audited if that's what you meant by "safe"
[09:08:57] <parsnip> alphapapa[m]: i've changed my habits to mix building muscle mass into schedule pretty well
[09:08:59] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: Cardio is a very poor way to burn calories.  Serious exertion only burns a small fraction of what you burn in a day's BMR.
[09:09:19] <Spawns_Carpeting> yeah thats what i meant codingquark 
[09:09:24] <parsnip> alphapapa[m]: right, i'm more just curious if increasing heart and lung capacity help me do more activities in general
[09:09:56] <alphapapa[m]> Spawns_Carpeting: MELPA only audits code when a package is first added to the repo.  After that, packages are built automatically.  So a malicious author could sneak in code, yes.  Thankfully that hasn't happened yet.  But that is a reason to not automatically upgrade packages.
[09:10:39] <codingquark> I never focused on weight loss. With age, my body is going to get fat, it is evolutionary behavior anyway. I can try keeping it in check, but really all I want is that I be 90% alright
[09:10:44] <parsnip> alphapapa[m]: hrm, when i got my first bike in a long while, i was on long bike rides, and i seem to recall looking a little better in the stomach

[09:13:52] <Spawns_Carpeting> I have a legit medical form of ocd that causes me to feel uncomfortable about malware and related threats. It's kind of silly but it does cause some real problems when using certain software so I end up being way overly careful to the point of absurdness 
[09:13:53] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: Calories in - calories out = caloric deficit = weight loss
[09:13:59] <codingquark> Is it getting harder and harder for usians to get hands on unprocessed foods?

[09:14:29] <codingquark> I see
[09:14:35] <parsnip> i meant it's gray, not a race issue
[09:14:40] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: You can commit the ELC files, and you generally should, unless you regularly downgrade your Emacs.  They are forwards-compatible, and if you didn't have them from a checkout, you'd have to manually re-byte-compile all of your packages.
[09:14:42] <parsnip> i mean, race can play in too
[09:14:45] <codingquark> parsnip: got it
[09:15:13] <bigRoo> So finally I upgraded to Pop OS 21.04 from 18.04 LTS and built Emacs 27.2 from source and installed it. But how could 'apt list --upgradable' list emacs27.1 as a candidate for update?
[09:15:25] <parsnip> alphapapa[m]: some #emacs bugs are people moving their .elc around os versions or devices
[09:15:48] <alphapapa[m]> parsnip: No, that's from moving backwards in Emacs versions.  OS version and device don't matter.
[09:15:58] <codingquark> alphapapa[m]: eventually your body figures out that it has chances to go into starvation. And starts preparing for the next round which literally means it starts aggressively storing long-term energy molecules every time it can
[09:16:20] <parsnip> alphapapa[m]: okay, fair, but often changing os version or device leads to a different emacs version

[10:09:57] <jaafar> alphapapa[m]: great idea but it turns out the answer is "clicking on the diamond to the left of the text"
[10:10:07] <jaafar> with my mouse, like a savage
[10:10:25] <jaafar> Things that don't work: clicking on the text. Pressing return. Pressing tab. Pressing space.
[10:10:42] <alphapapa[m]> jaafar: I think putting point on the arrow and pressing RET or SPC usually does it
[10:10:50] <jaafar> hm, OK
[10:11:22] <jaafar> RET works, SPC pages down

[10:13:08] <alphapapa[m]> jaafar: I think it's a common pattern in Emacs to put point on something and press RET.  That's how text buttons work.
[10:13:41] <jaafar> Yeah! But usually the text works
[10:13:47] <jaafar> that was the first thing I tried
[10:13:51] <alphapapa[m]> jaafar: Anyway, a sort of self-documenting way to discover it might be to put point on the arrow and use "C-u C-x =", then look at the keymap property
[10:14:25] <jaafar> That's a cool trick, I will try it in the future if I can remember
[10:14:41] <jaafar> I just thought that diamond (not an arrow, for me) was some kind of decoration
[10:14:46] <alphapapa[m]> jaafar: I think tree-widget was designed for the customization system, and its items are often fields that can be typed into, so that might explain why just pressing RET on the text doesn't expand it
[10:14:48] <jaafar> until I clicked on it, anyway

[10:18:13] <jaafar> I think I complained about this in a different context already with lsp
[10:18:52] <jaafar> There's some other informational window you can pop up that also uses tree-widget
[10:19:24] <jaafar> and everything starts collapsed, so if you don't know that it's a tree-widget, or how to use one, it's pretty confusing
[10:19:41] <alphapapa[m]> sounds like that lsp package might want to improve that

[12:27:34] <alphapapa[m]> codingquark: The Elisp manual says about define-minor-mode: The command named MODE first performs the standard actions such as setting the variable named MODE and then executes the BODY forms, if any.  It then runs the mode hook variable ‘MODE-hook’ and finishes by evaluating any form in ‘:after-hook’.

[17:23:28] <Enfors> I'm running emacs in a terminal (emacs -nw) on Linux. Using elpy, I get dropdown menus for auto completion when I code in Python. However, some of the text in this menu is in the same color as the background, so I want to change it. But when I M-x describe-face to find out which face it's using, the menu disappears, so it is no longer under point. So how do I find out which face this is?

[17:51:07] <rpav> Harzilein: i don't know how that works specifically, but note you can use emacsclient to run code as well .. e.g. i have an `erc` script that's actually `emacsclient ... -e '(switch-to-buffer "#emacs")'` 
[17:51:12] *** Joins: vs^ (~vs@12.16.129.111)
[17:51:37] <rpav> you could run anything there, like whatever launches mh-e stuff and switches to that box
[17:53:34] <Harzilein> yeah, what i mean is that the documentation for mh-visit-folder says to only ever use mh-rmail as an entry point. and indeed, if i don't start mh-rmail first, mh-visit-folder does not work right. if i do start it first, it of course unneccessarily delays startup.
[17:53:59] <Harzilein> and i think it should not matter if i use emacsclient or emacs --eval
[17:54:13] <rpav> well, emacs --eval starts a new emacs

[17:54:32] <Plazma> RIP
[17:54:40] <rpav> if you want minimal delay, start one emacs, e.g. emacs --daemon, and use emacsclient to open frames with it
[17:55:00] <rpav> your mh-rmail can run once at startup and then you do whatever in the frame you open
[17:55:05] <rpav> (presumably)
[17:55:08] <Harzilein> that's what i want in this case, i really only have two shell functions set up now that feed appropriate arguments to emacs --eval for info reader (because the standalone one sucks) and for mh-e
[17:55:50] <rpav> but one emacs can run all the things ;)
[17:56:29] <Harzilein> that's really a digression
[17:56:48] <rpav> not really; you don't want mh-rmail delaying things
