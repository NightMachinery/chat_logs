[02:30:06] <ubntu> hello I have setup two cronjobs to run on my ubuntu server. Basically they just copy files from a cloud drive I have mounted to a local drive. The jobs are listed here: https://paste.debian.net/1211772/ - they run on the 15th of every month at 2am and 3am respectively. They appear to have run last this morning, however they did not run properly.
[02:30:06] <ubntu> Only one of them ran and I have multiple instances of it running now which doesn't make sense. Also, only one directory copied across from the cloud drive, the other 5 did not. And one of the scripts never ran (homeassist_backup) - they both run okay when I run them manually.

[04:03:21] <stevecam> akoana, sort of, it got me to where i wanted, grub will install and update itself to a location it thinks itself, something to do with $GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR maybe, I don't know, but I just created a directory in (hd0,gpt3)/Debian and made it load configuration from (hd0,gpt4)/grub, it is no longer a problem for me :-)
[04:03:43] <nergar> you're planning on staying on 5.4 for that long? that might not be a good idea with a rolling release like void

[06:17:54] <SineDeviance> TheQuickRedFox: fedora on a server is a terrible idea, it has a 13 month release cycle. use an LTS release of something instead
[06:18:10] <TheQuickRedFox> You must download your kernel source on an auspicious day

[08:22:39] <No1x3r0> I may have seen that before, but forgot
[08:22:41] <THE_GFR> I don't think many people know that

[08:23:15] <THE_GFR> and besides if you open Terminal and type in Palimcest in Gnome it'll launch the nerfed version of Disk Utility
[08:23:34] <No1x3r0> there's a nerffed version ?
[08:23:37] <TheQuickRedFox> Why did they do that?

[08:30:43] <THE_GFR> TheQuickRedFox: because, this version is better and self contained and doesn't need a lot of extra libraries and whatnot added into the OS to make it work
[08:30:57] <doctor_who> I'd say 2nds is KDE
[08:30:58] <SineDeviance> used to be the big three were gnome, KDE and XFCE. I bet that's changed
[08:31:00] <THE_GFR> TheQuickRedFox: I asked my dev and he said it was a huge spagetti of code
[08:31:01] <rustytaco> i like xfce pretty well. it's not overly bloated. yea i have 6gb of ram.. but i'd rather as little go to the UI as possible
[08:31:04] <doctor_who> most popular is gnome
[08:31:14] <rascul> SineDeviance i doubt it has changed, just the order of those three

[13:04:46] <Sauvin> ThomasD13, that's not actually off-topic. Many people apparently have some kind of blocker in their web browsers that prevent them from being able to read what's pasted via pastebin.
[13:04:54] <lopid> javascript and adverts, probably
[13:05:00] <rudi_s> 10:13 < jim> rudi_s, pastebin.com is known to do several things, ads, capchas, anti-adblock measures, and a very large javascript payload

So Basically (for what I've read cause sometimes information is vague just plain commands for script kiddies trying to set up Kali) , Luks works by adding a header on the "partition" that wants to encrypt? , so the procedure is 1st) Plain format the drive , 2nd) Partition it , 3th) Luks
[18:58:56] <fakuve> encrypt whichever partition you want

[18:59:46] <djph> LUKS is (IIRC) a container within a LVM group
[18:59:49] <oem> Chi tourneys cago r GO
[19:00:13] <n4dir> at least in debian you can either luks encrypt or with lvm, so probably not a lvm thing. But what do i know
[19:00:15] <fakuve> djph: ok so do you need to partition it first or afterwards the encryption?
[19:00:23] <msiism> Wait, LUKS, doesn't depend on LVM, right?
[19:00:28] <bairen> djph: not necessarily
[19:00:34] <Psi-Jack> msiism: Depend on? No.

[19:04:25] <oem> on my lvl lol hmmm?
[19:04:31] <bairen> by formatting he most likely means creating a partition table

[21:08:09] <Dagmar> Doesn't matter in the least.  If you involve disk reads or writes in a network test, you ARE NOT measuring the network speed anymore
[21:08:24] <SineDeviance> sumthing1980: you could have a brand new i3 (which is fast) or a first-gen (which is really slow by today's standards)
[21:08:41] <sumthing1980> its is old i3 and old i7, lga 1155 I think
[21:08:53] <SineDeviance> sumthing1980: just go look up the model of the chips
[21:09:03] <Dagmar> Pretty much any CPU capable of talking to a PCIe bus should be able to saturate a gigabit connection, _if the testing method is appropriate_
[21:09:13] <Dagmar> Involving disks is not part of that

[21:09:41] <sumthing1980> both saturate gbit if the other is not slow, if the other end is fast then they get 110mb/s instead of 70 mb/s

[22:44:18] <ayecee> BinarySavior: if you have a three char password, it will be pretty quick. even a super computer would choke on 12 char though.
[22:44:20] <koala_man> Helmholtz: you can probably find an xslt that generates it and then use an xml-only tool to convert

[22:47:06] <rapha> okay, so, on this old Core i5 ThinkPad Yoga, my ruby one-liner does 23MB of XML into JSON in ... 1m39s and using ... a shit ton of RAM. pretty sure Python could do it a lot faster, but also pretty sure that the most is going on in the underlying compiled XML library (guessing it to be C++).
[22:47:12] <fakuve> Meaning are the commands like Linux ?
[22:47:25] <Sauvin> fakuve, no, they're a lot more like freebsd.

[22:47:45] <asgas> it's zsh I think.
[22:47:51] <dragonmaster> Sauvin: Yeah, I was mostly just trying to be cute.   On the more serious side, it looks like we have here a situation where a task must be done and there is no easy way to do it without some discomfort.   My real recommendation for Helmholtz is to go with the most expressive language you can and get it done in order to minimize the time he's programming while holding his nose.   Then, when it's
[22:47:53] <fakuve> What is their network manager ?
[22:47:53] <dragonmaster> done, he can forget about it and move on.

[22:48:18] <fakuve> they have `ip addr` of some sort?
[22:48:25] <Sauvin> In my case, that would be perl. It depends on what you already know. :D

[23:42:02] <nattiestnate> hi, so i have RHEL 7.5 running in a virtual machine, which has 2 network interfaces: eth0, which is connected to a host-only network with a fixed ip (192.168.42.10) and gateway 192.168.42.1, and eth1 connected to NAT with DHCP
[23:42:07] <TheSilentLink> hello I have created a disk image of a 128gb sd card and when I try to restore to another 128gb sd card it says it is 178mb to large how can I fix it this?
[23:42:26] <ayecee> TheSilentLink: what says that
[23:42:34] <TheSilentLink> ayecee: gnome disk utility
[23:42:44] <ayecee> what is the message from gnome disk utility
[23:43:11] <TheSilentLink> the disk image is 178mb bigger than the target device
[23:43:15] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[23:43:20] <ayecee> get a bigger target device i guess
[23:43:22] <TheSilentLink> they are both 128gb sd cards
[23:43:30] <ayecee> approximately
[23:43:39] <ayecee> one is 178mb bigger than the other apparently
[23:43:46] <nattiestnate> (cont'd) with this configuration i can't connect to the internet. if i attempt to ping 8.8.8.8, it returns: From 192.168.42.1 icmp_seq=n Destination Port Unreachable (n being number).
[23:43:49] <TheSilentLink> so I need to throw away my new sd card and buy another one and hope it is 178mb bigger?
[23:43:49] <jmcantrell> how can i see which device is being used by a luks mapping?
[23:44:11] <TheSilentLink> can I not trim off 128mb?
[23:44:15] <TheSilentLink> 178*
[23:44:44] <nattiestnate> *however*, if i swap the networks (i.e. eth0 connected to NAT while eth1 connected to host-only network), i can access both the host-only network, and the internet at the same time. what's the reason behind this?
[23:44:51] <ayecee> i mean, what you do with the new sd card is up to you. throwing it away seems a little extreme.

[23:48:33] <ayecee> TheSilentLink: that's the part you'll have to figure out. if there's one large partition in the image, you could use something like gparted to shrink the partition, so it didn't extend into the last 178mb of the file
