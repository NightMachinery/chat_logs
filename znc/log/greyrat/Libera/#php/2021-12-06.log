[00:05:25] <acu> thanks - yes I am working on it now - need to up the memory_limit from default of 128M to ? I still do not know how to monitor if this is a bottleneck for speed
[00:05:37] <acu> I am running Nextcloud 21
[00:06:16] <AllenJB> memory_limit is never a performance bottleneck - you either hit it or you don't. PHP doesn't change behavior as it nears the limit or anything like that.
[00:08:51] <acu> It seem that post_max_size is a parameter which determines my largas upload_max_filesize ---- therefor the memory limit shouls be bigger than post_max_zise
[00:09:52] <AllenJB> As far as I know memory_limit has no impact on post_max_size / upload_max_filesize - File uploads are not (directly) counted against memory_limit.
[00:10:12] <AllenJB> Put simply: memory_limit is just the memory that your script code consumes
[00:10:38] <AllenJB> Files / file uploads only count towards that if you bring the content into the script using something like file_get_contents()
[00:10:48] <acu> So if I have two users trying to upload in the same time each a 500M file - than the total memory limit should be at least 1012M (bigger than both max file size)
[00:11:08] <acu> OK - sorry I was typing when you wrote the message - I am reading it now
[00:11:40] <acu> Is there a way to now whether I should increase the memory limit ?
[00:11:56] <acu> someting like top for php ?
[00:12:19] <AllenJB> memory_limit, post_max_size and upload_max_filesize are per-script / per-request values. If 2 users run a script that consumes 20MB, your memory limit only needs to be (slightly higher than) 20MB
[00:12:38] <acu> OK thanks that is cool
[00:12:57] <acu> do I need to have special RAM considerations when I run Redis and ACPU
[00:14:44] *** Quits: jeffrey (~jeffrey@80-115-60-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:14:51] <AllenJB> php-fpm has a status page which includes info on how much memory a worker used.
[00:14:51] <AllenJB> There's also memory_get_usage() and memory_get_peak_usage(). PHP will emit a fatal error when the memory limit is hit, so if you're monitoring errors (either by watching logs or using a tool such as Sentry) you'll see when the limit is hit.
[00:15:34] <AllenJB> You can also profile PHP scripts using a debugger such as xdebug. And there's APM tools / services such as NewRelic APM.
[00:16:04] <acu> AllenJB, you give me gold info - I really appreciate
[00:16:52] <acu> I even do not know if there are multiple requests - if PHP will use different CPUs ?
[00:17:13] <AllenJB> I have no experience with APCu, so can't comment on that. With redis PHP is just acting as a client, so as with files, content only counts towards PHP's memory_limit when you  bring it into your script.
[00:17:47] <AllenJB> (Also using both redis and APCu seems slightly weird to me, since they're both cache servers AFAIK)
[00:18:36] <acu> yes - I have to learn the reason for that - https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#memory-caching-backend-configuration
[00:19:57] <AllenJB> Different PHP processes / (FPM) workers will use different CPUs that same as any other processes. "By default" PHP is single-threaded, so a single request / script will not use multiple CPUs.

[02:02:50] <TML> esselfe: I know you figured it out in this particular case, but for future reference, when it comes specifically to mysql, "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" are not the same thing. I can't recall the specifics off-hand, but it sees them as different.
[02:03:13] <TML> It might be that the name uses domain sockets and the IP uses a TCP port? Something like that.
[02:04:28] <esselfe> I see
[02:06:07] <Blondie101010> well the hostname is part of the identication in mysql, so that could be relevant
[02:07:23] <esselfe> it works with both "localhost" and "127.0.0.1"

[03:30:27] <da_wunder> hmm, if I remember correctly that `mysql` command uses `localhost` as a default, you can change that with `--host somehost` option
[03:31:11] <TML> > Whenever you specify "localhost" or "localhost:port" as server, the MySQL client library will override this and try to connect to a local socket (named pipe on Windows). If you want to use TCP/IP, use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost".

[03:32:30] <entropy_> yes
[03:32:53] <TML> https://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-execution-time
[03:33:48] <da_wunder> and for that port I remember that you need to use `--port` option with that `mysql` command
[03:36:14] <TML> da_wunder: all I was trying to say is that the mysql client library itself has some special processing logic when it sees the name "localhost", and that can bite people using languages like PHP where they're expecting PHP to provide a consistent behaviour across databases
[03:38:45] <da_wunder> I would not compare some cli tools like mysql to anything what php provides for mysql...
[03:38:51] <da_wunder> that makes no sense at all
[03:39:08] <da_wunder> just read the manual and see what you need to use and that is all
[03:39:14] <__adrian> php doesn't provide mysqlnd
[03:39:17] <__adrian> mysql does
[03:40:08] <__adrian> i.e., it isn't pdo or php that does special things when you type "localhost". it's the driver.
[03:47:55] <da_wunder> not sure how that is related - the problem was just "00:31 < esselfe> omg I think I just found out why, I inverted hostname and username! 00:31 < esselfe> I was thinking user@host, but it's mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass, $dbname)! It works!"
[03:48:40] <TML> da_wunder: I was pretty explicit that my information was _NOT_ related to their problem, but might be a good thing for them to keep in mind for the future.

[06:01:56] <Sanden> Everyone tried to help me fix my sendmail PERL to work as a PHP, and no matter what we tried - nothing worked. It was because Go Daddy's technicians didn't hve the server configured properly. After a week of calling, telling them things weren't working - suddenly ALL forms, the PERL and the PHP both began working. They continue to deny it was their
[06:01:57] <Sanden> issue. I guess it was magic?
[06:03:13] <__adrian> i chuckled a bit the first ten times i heard the "haha crap hosting" story. now i just gently remind everyone to not use crap hosting.
[06:04:17] <Sanden> Sadly, it's a poor cat rescue. They didn't pick the host, their initial developer did. Dreamhost will host it for free - are they okay?
[06:05:40] <Sanden> I hope that's not spamming, just a question.
[06:06:10] <trollboy> Dreamhost is right up there with godaddy
[06:06:22] <trollboy> some have great luck.. others.. like you experienced on godaddy
[06:06:28] <trollboy> You're comparing walmart vs kmart
[06:06:55] <__adrian> "what's the best" type questions are generally off-topic. i've never used dreamhost but they seem to be well-established. and if they're offering to host for free, at least you're not wasting money on that front.
[06:07:20] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[06:07:46] <__adrian> hey, walmart holds nothing against kmart  :p  at least back before martha stewart got her hands on it
[06:08:11] <Rockwood> what is kmart?
[06:08:32] <__adrian> Sanden: a quick google shows they charge for "some" forms of support. you might want to look into what kind of support you can expect with their charity hosting.
[06:08:39] <trollboy> it was a, now mostly defunct, cheap BS store like walmart.
[06:08:48] <__adrian> beyond that, i couldn't make a recommendation either way
[06:08:51] <Sanden> Any other hosts do the 501c3 charity free host? This rescue literally pulls cats and kittens who are injured from cages at shelters and rushes them to vets and asks for donations. They have a little shop where cat ladies donate their bric-a-brac and they sell it to other cat ladies, so there's this big cycle of cat clutter recycling
[06:09:29] <__adrian> don't know. that'd have to be something you research
[06:09:52] <Sanden> I have, Dreamhost is the only one I've found. :/
[06:10:17] <trollboy> so it sounds like it *is* the best; by your own research.
[06:10:19] <Rockwood> Sanden, https://www.freehostia.com/ you can try this too
[06:10:29] <trollboy> the question becomes then; is the best good enough?
[06:10:38] <Sanden> Rockwood: looking
[06:11:20] <Rockwood> its free for one year
[06:11:34] <__adrian> as trollboy implied, many cheap/free hosts turn out to be about the same in terms of crappiness. so i'd advise taking your time with the research, else you'll just find yourself bouncing around from crap to crap and not knowing whether you're better off in the end.

[10:22:04] <TML> I believe that problem usually occurs because they're not actually the same version of phpunit
[10:25:44] <lembron> sure? well no, they arent, close but one (bin) is a wrapper-proxy (both php, no bash or so tho)
[10:26:45] <lembron> "not the same version" sounds about right tho - the binscript checks for "PHP_VERSION_ID < 80000" - and my phpunit version is faaaaaaar away from that the newest "it" knows is 7.0 :P

[21:38:18] <judah> jmpp, I ran into a similar issue a while back in my application. Something to do with the authentication mechanism changing in mysql 8. This might help: https://aregsar.com/blog/2020/connecting-laravel-to-digitalocean-managed-mysql-database/
[21:38:29] <judah> I dont know if its the same issue, but it might be worth investigating
[21:39:15] <Blondie101010> it's all the same problem as far as I know
[21:40:06] <jmpp> yeah, it's the same issue, but that fix, which implies reverting the MySQL authentication type to the legacy mysql_native_password is what was recommended for PHP < 7.4.3, because prior to that the new caching_sha2_password authenticatio mechanism was either poorly supported or not at all
[21:40:17] <jmpp> and I'm running PHP 7.4.26, and that's what has me confused
[21:40:52] <jmpp> I could just employ the same fix, and change my MySQL user to mysql_native_password authentication, but, at least for the time being, I'd rather understand what's going on with my PHP installation
[21:41:54] <Blondie101010> that would be a question for #mysql as they're the ones who support your RDBMS and provide the PHP library
[21:42:14] <jmpp> but isn't PHP 7.4 using mysqlnd by default?
[21:42:15] <Blondie101010> ie: mysqlnd
[21:42:27] <Blondie101010> you can check your config but it should
[21:42:31] <jmpp> and isn't mysqlnd created by PHP itself?
[21:42:34] <Blondie101010> phpinfo() from the correct SAPI
[21:42:58] <__adrian> no, mysqlnd is provided by mysql
[21:43:03] <jmpp> I'd get the same information via php -i on the command line, right?
[21:43:06] <__adrian> "nd" = "native driver"
[21:43:09] <__adrian> no
[21:43:34] <__adrian> php-cli and php on your webserver usually don't use the same ini. they're not even necessarily the same php.
[21:43:42] <jmpp> __adrian: right, native driver, and I was conviced it'd been created by the PHP team
[21:43:50] *** Joins: xep (~xep@76-210-4-7.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[21:43:53] <jmpp> they are in this case

[21:44:42] <Blondie101010> so yeah
[21:44:44] <jmpp> I guess I'm missing the necessary password plugin
[21:44:56] <__adrian> if they are, and they do, then sure. but assuming that checking one is checking the other is not a good habit, as it's usually not true.
[21:45:21] <jmpp> I just created this insallation, I know they're the same, no worries there
[21:45:24] <Blondie101010> would anyone know of a way to get CLI PHP scripts logs to include the script name without touching the code?
[21:45:27] <jmpp> in fact, no web server here, just CLI php
[21:46:34] <jmpp> is enabling one of those auhtentication plugins a build-time setting?
[21:49:39] <da_wunder> so can you connect to that mysql server on pure shell with eg. `mysql -u someuser -p ...` command?
[21:50:01] <da_wunder> and if not, then your problem is not related to php
[21:50:28] <jmpp> yes, I can

[21:52:36] <da_wunder> and you're making that php cli call in the same server?
[21:54:17] <jmpp> of course
[21:54:39] <da_wunder> we don't know that, that is why we need to ask those questions
[21:55:00] <jmpp> the issue is most probably that the caching_sha2_password plugin to the mysqlnd driver is not enabled, so I'm trying to figure out why that is and, of course, how to enable it
[21:58:07] <da_wunder> so maybe this helps you - https://php.watch/articles/PHP-7.4-MySQL-8-server-gone-away-fix
[22:00:07] <jmpp> no, that changes the MySQL user back to caching_sha2_password after having reverted it to mysql_native_password, and my issue is that my PHP installation seems to be missing support for the caching_sha2_password auth mechanism
[22:06:44] <jmpp> __adrian: https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.mysqlnd.php " MySQL Native Driver is part of the official PHP sources as of PHP 5.3.0.
[22:06:47] <jmpp> "
[22:07:02] <jmpp> does PHP import it from a MySQL upstream?
[22:07:03] <__adrian> yes? i know
[22:07:08] <__adrian> mysql provides it
[22:07:13] <jmpp> OK
[22:07:43] <jmpp> read that a long time ago and assumed it was created by the PHP team from scratch
[22:07:44] <__adrian> i'd guess that somehow you have an older version of mysqlnd
[22:07:56] <__adrian> but i don't know how that would happen or how you'd update it

[22:10:52] <__adrian> aside: is there a reason you're trying to run all this on osx? generally, it's a good idea to have a dev env that is similar to your intended production env.
[22:11:11] <__adrian> e.g., via docker

[22:13:57] <__adrian> i ran a dev env on my mbp for a few years for work. was infuriating.
[22:14:03] <jmpp> why? this issue? this is just a minor annoyance with a new laptop I recently got, have been doing this kind of development for around 15 years
[22:15:26] <Rockwood> what is mbp?
[22:15:36] <jmpp> MacBook Pro
[22:15:39] <__adrian> macbook pro
[22:15:40] <da_wunder> personally I recommend to use docker for development setup, so that you can get exactly same environment for development as you use on production
[22:15:45] <__adrian> ^
[22:15:50] <jmpp> __adrian: for me, on the contrary, it's been super convenient
[22:15:54] <Rockwood> ah okay thanks
[22:16:05] <__adrian> i learned to basically avoid trying to install anything special at all on that thing
[22:16:11] <__adrian> glad you like it
[22:16:44] <jmpp> I've curated my config files for years... install Apache, PHP, MySQL, drop in the configs, and be done with it. In this case, though, I'm trying to get away from the local web server and just use PHP's built-in server... dev locally, and push to my FAMP box
[22:17:04] <__adrian> but regardless of preferences or hurdles, as da_wunder says - docker (or similar) has objective benefits
[22:17:28] <__adrian> i strongly recommend against using php's builtin dev server as an actual dev env
[22:17:38] <jmpp> but starting from scratch after years with an old MBP is presenting me with this issue that I'm trying to fix without doing the old auth workaround
[22:17:50] <__adrian> it's fine for messing around and quick PoCs, but it's not intended to be anything like a real webserver
[22:17:51] <jmpp> __adrian: why's that?
[22:17:58] <jmpp> right, of course
[22:18:04] <jmpp> not using it in that capacity
[22:18:17] <jmpp> that's what my FAMP env is for
[22:18:19] <Rockwood> i am using Asus laptop for dev work
[22:18:26] <__adrian> i didn't think so. but it goes back to your dev env being similar to your target prod env.
[22:18:28] <jmpp> code locally, make sure things look OK, push there and test
[22:18:40] <Rockwood> i added VM with ubuntu 20
[22:18:44] <jmpp> dev & prod are identical, of course
[22:19:20] <__adrian> so you have a dev and a "local dev"?

[23:02:24] <jmpp> __adrian: need to rebuild PHP from source with --with-openssl configure argument to have MySQLnd support caching_sha2_password, https://dev.mysql.com/doc/apis-php/en/apis-php-mysqlnd.install.html
[23:02:34] <jmpp> but I'll finish looking at that later, already taking too long
[23:02:47] <jmpp> I'll just create a new user with the old auth mechanism for the time being
[23:02:57] <jmpp> at least I know what's going on, which was my goal ;)

[23:10:28] <Albright> Anyone have suggestions for a library which can find and ideally format diffs between two bits of text?
[23:12:48] <Sammitch> exec('diff'); // :D
[23:13:19] <Albright> gross
[23:14:47] <biberu> `diff`?
[23:14:52] <Sammitch> ok fine proc_open(), but everyone always complains about it even though it's objectively the best way to launch an external process
[23:16:26] <Albright> I'd prefer not to launch an external process to do this if it can be helped
[23:18:08] <TinoDidriksen> https://github.com/horde/Text_Diff still works just fine.
[23:19:17] <Albright> Hmm, no documentation except an external link which links to a page which has… no documentation
