[22:07:00] <edgar-rft> you could eat your company, except if you're in the Vegan Cook Club
[22:07:01] <murthy> I mean as a vegan
[22:07:38] <edgar-rft> are vegans allowed to eat humans?
[22:07:46] <murthy> edgar-rft: Would you like to join me for the dinner? :)
[22:07:57] <Panther> murthy, I met a nice Indian guy last night.
[22:08:08] <Panther> I invited him to come on IRC.
[22:08:28] <murthy> edgar-rft: yuck
[22:08:38] <Panther> I might see him again in a few minutes,.. I am going to meet some ppl at a bokstore-cafe.
[22:08:44] <murthy> edgar-rft: that's the worst one can eat on earth
[22:09:29] <edgar-rft> imagine you were a vegan cannibal, and then?
[22:10:08] <Panther> I might have to leave -r on, cuz it's hard enough to get new ppl on IRC w/o telling them about registering and bots and nickserv, etc... before they ever chat.
[22:10:14] <murthy> Panther: Where did you meet him?
[22:10:24] <Panther> At the Barcade last night.
[22:10:29] <murthy> edgar-rft: I will kill myself
[22:10:58] <murthy> edgar-rft: compared to every other living thing on earth I have zero respect for humans
[22:11:30] <murthy> If some asteroid or meteor hits and kills all humans it would be awesome
[22:11:42] <Panther> 3 hrs of playing arcade games, and then 2 hrs of salsa dancing.
[22:11:52] <murthy> Wait, I think we don't need that, there is coal
[22:11:55] <Panther> I exchanged phone numbers with a cute girl who runs a virtual reality lab at Yale.
[22:11:56] <Panther> :)
[22:12:07] <Panther> And a few others, including Shikhar.
[22:12:19] <Panther> He requested a song for my show this week.
[22:12:19] <murthy> Panther: awesome!
[22:13:06] <murthy> Panther: nice
[22:13:46] <Panther> I think he would like it on IRC.
[22:14:23] <murthy> idk how irc will react
[22:14:58] <Panther> Oh.. I met abother guy, Paul, who _actually_ knows what IRC, freenode, and libera are.
[22:15:10] <murthy> Some people already think there are too many Indians just because of me.
[22:15:22] <Panther> That is the first time I met a civilian who knew about IRC.
[22:15:31] <murthy> :)
[22:15:55] <murthy> It's like me meeting a Linux nerd in person :)
[22:16:16] <Panther> Which he also is.
[22:16:32] <murthy> Nice
[22:16:43] <Panther> He works out, too, and goes to Renaissance fairs.
[22:16:54] <murthy> Nice
[22:17:06] <murthy> I think you got yourself a friend
[22:17:39] <edgar-rft> murthy: imagine you were a vegan cannibal, and you kill yourself, would you eat yourself, maybe after death?
[22:18:29] <murthy> edgar-rft: It would be better to eat you first cause you are a smarty pants
[22:18:50] <Panther> In order to be a vegan cannibal, you couldn't be an animal.
[22:19:08] <murthy> Ha ha ha
[22:20:07] <murthy> Aren't those people in coma are called a vegetable?
[22:20:44] <Panther> Sometimes, I guess, but they would have a hard time eating themselves while inna coma :)
[22:21:33] <murthy> No but vegan can eat those "vegetables" and become a vegan canibal :)
[22:22:37] <Panther> That's an interesting point.. has veganism to do with eating sentient beings?
[22:23:11] <Panther> cuz if it was, then they could justify eating someone who had been declared a 'vegetable.'
[22:24:12] <murthy> idk for me the trees are more sentient than humans

[22:46:32] <artao> it was that kind of snow that just kinda sits on top of the grass
[22:46:32] <murthy> artao: so that eviction matter is settled?
[22:46:36] <artao> no idea
[22:46:42] <artao> yes?
[22:46:52] <artao> they have no grounds for eviction
[22:46:58] <murthy> Dude
[22:47:06] <artao> i've not yet composed my reply to her letter
[22:47:26] <artao> if i bring my disc golf basket indoors i am FAR less likely to actually use it
[22:47:30] <artao> so no. i won't do that
[22:47:37] <artao> it's an outdoors item and belongs outdoors
[22:47:49] <artao> just like when they wanted me to keep my bike trailer indoors
[22:47:51] <artao> fuck off
[22:47:52] <artao> no
[22:47:53] <murthy> I think it's a eviction notice, not a letter for concent
[22:48:05] <artao> it's a 5-day notice
[22:48:15] <artao> that means "fix the problem or we'll evict you"
[22:48:22] <artao> after the 5 days, there's another 30 day process
[22:48:32] <artao> no eviction arbitrator is going to side with them
[22:48:36] <artao> i will fight this
[22:48:49] <murthy> Oh that's nice
[22:48:56] <artao> HUD has, in the past, told me that they can't evict for "untidynes" or whatever. it's a meaningless and entirely subjective term
[22:49:11] <artao> that was regarding inside my apartment
[22:49:23] <artao> frankly, i take offense at my stuff being called "dumpy"
[22:49:24] <murthy> :)
[22:50:01] <murthy> So manure on the corn field is ok for them and this is issue?
[22:50:07] <artao> if some non-poverty asshats don't like the look of my things they can kiss my zit-ridden ass
[22:50:22] <artao> they can't use manure in town
[22:50:27] <artao> there ARE regulations about that
[22:50:41] <artao> there's no city ordinances regarding "dumpiness"
[22:50:50] <murthy> Ya
