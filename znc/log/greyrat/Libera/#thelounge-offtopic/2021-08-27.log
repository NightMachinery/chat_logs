[00:00:02] <MaxLeiter> so at least I got my laptop back but I also made someone quite a bit of $ 
[00:00:33] <Activ8> first day - format would have fixed all your problems
[00:00:34] <Activ8> lol
[00:00:45] <MaxLeiter> buuut this means I can work on lounge outside of codespaces 
[00:00:48] <MaxLeiter> I couldnt use the laptop to do anything
[00:00:53] <MaxLeiter> it would basically freeze when I tried to type to login 
[00:01:05] <MaxLeiter> and I wanted to be sure to keep my data
[00:01:24] <Activ8> might have been able to pull the drive out n stick it in a caddy
[00:01:54] <Activ8> i do that sometimes, unless encryption is on then no chance
[00:02:27] <Activ8> the question is where did them miners come from
[00:17:03] <MaxLeiter> yeah, I'm pretty good about not downloading (untrustworthy) things 
[00:17:20] <MaxLeiter> and mac has soldered SSD so no removing. The repair place had to dual-boot a guest OS on or something 
[00:17:35] <Activ8> yeh
[00:17:39] <Activ8> well it's fixed now right
[00:17:44] <MaxLeiter> heres hoping
[00:18:49] <Activ8> I had similar systems I fixed but on windows, duel booted ran some tools n removed the miners

[15:07:00] <Activ8> :(
[15:18:21] <archpc> I‚Äôm like :|
[15:18:39] <Activ8> how long has it been now
[15:19:34] <archpc> About a week since the positive result 
[15:20:26] <Activ8> I see, how is the breathing?
[15:21:00] <archpc> I just have this weird wheeze niw
[15:21:05] <archpc> Now
[15:21:54] <Activ8> I vote for a name change to wheezie
[15:22:14] * archpc whacks Activ8 with a tuna 
[15:22:22] * Activ8 slaps archpc around a bit with a large trout
[15:22:29] <Activ8> üòÉ
[15:23:04] * archpc unzips 
[15:25:31] * Activ8 runs away
[15:27:00] <archpc> :(
[15:27:07] <archpc> Why do they always run
[15:27:37] <Activ8> because you are not supposed to do that
[15:27:53] <archpc> But.. my priest did :|
[15:28:27] <Activ8> he got murdered for it
[15:28:49] <archpc> Hahaha 
[15:29:41] <archpc> I‚Äôve been using my downtime to design a change for some infrastructure at work, moving from an admittedly.. janky Linux setup to a few FreeBSD and OpenBSD servers 
[15:30:01] <archpc> I just can‚Äôt particularly justify it, other then ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored‚Äù
[15:30:16] <Activ8> there isn't anything wrong with that, that's a good time to sort it out to be fair
[15:30:24] <Activ8> while it's quiet and you get time out
[15:31:04] <archpc> Yeah, but it‚Äôs a Jenga tower of shit
[15:32:27] <Activ8> yep like most things
[15:32:29] <archpc> And to be quite honest I don‚Äôt touch Linux too much 
[15:32:41] <Activ8> I love linux as a server
[15:33:26] * archpc covers his ancient FreeBSD home server‚Äôs ears
[15:34:30] <Activ8> I use a micro box which is a quad core with 16gb ram, silent and that has ubuntu server core on it
[15:36:22] <archpc> Mines a dell optiplex I got in high school, 8GB of ram, some old Quattro card, i7 2600

[15:40:06] <Activ8> that's what I run the lounge on and my docker containers e.t.c
[15:41:13] <archpc> o.o
[15:42:18] <archpc> My lounge install is on a hacky linode
[15:42:49] <archpc> OpenBSD as the base, Alpine Linux running under vmd, with docker

[15:43:41] <Activ8> I used to have TLC on Google VPS but moved internal
[15:43:46] <Activ8> my lines stable enough now
[15:45:21] <archpc> My home internet is mediocre 
[15:46:19] <archpc> The GNU ls program
[15:46:21] <Activ8> haha
[15:46:26] <archpc> Is like 4000 lines
[15:47:03] <Activ8> not sure what that is
[15:47:29] <archpc> ls
[15:47:55] <archpc> the OpenBSD ls is 600 lines
[15:48:19] <Activ8> ah
[15:48:21] <archpc> I just realized it and it make me do a double take
