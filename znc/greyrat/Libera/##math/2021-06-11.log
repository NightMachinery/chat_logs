[08:06:39] <johnkeats6> loopspace, were you into machine learning stuff?
[08:07:06] <PlanckWalk> "The reals can be well-ordered" just means that there is a structure, with domain real numbers, that is a well-order.

[08:11:55] <int-e> And I mean, it can be ordered in several different ways at the same time.
[08:12:14] <int-e> Because in the end it's just several relations on that set.
[08:12:46] <rex> yeah if S is a set and R,T are orders on it then (S,R) and (S,T) are "ordered sets"
[08:12:58] <PlanckWalk> It's especially irrelevant in discussions about ZFC, in which the statement is translated to literally just an existential statement about a set.

[08:19:57] <PlanckWalk> Well, you can complete the metric space of rationals without recourse to ordering.

[08:21:14] <PlanckWalk> Yes :-(

[08:23:12] <PlanckWalk> Capso: The context for this question goes back at least half a day
[08:23:18] <int-e> Capso: I mean that the reals do have an order when you treat them as an ordered field. That's fine, it's a big part of the structure we care about.
[08:23:45] <Capso> oh, yeah i don't have the historical context of this question
[08:24:03] <int-e> Capso: Em's notion, as far as I understand is, is that when we well-order the reals (provided we can...), that structure is somehow lost.
[08:24:23] <Capso> it's just interesting to coatruct reals from rationals with no order axioms
[08:25:34] <rex> ok i didn't know the exact wording when you talked to em, I understood it like: should we call (ℝ,+,*,0,1,≤) the reals or (ℝ,+,*,0,1) or ℝ
[08:25:47] <int-e> Capso: Sure, you can do that as well.
[08:25:48] <Capso> int-e: structure is lost in reals when we well-order them? that's the question?
[08:26:27] <PlanckWalk> No
[08:26:49] <int-e> Capso: No, that's the notion (hesitant to even call it an idea) the question is based on.

[08:29:07] <int-e> (To most mathematicians they'll still be the reals even then... but we didn't get that far. Heck, you can reconstruct the order just from the ring structure.)
[08:29:22] <PlanckWalk> The question was whether the phrase "the reals can be well-ordered" makes any sense.

[19:40:49] <x4rchimedes> I see
[19:40:55] <x4rchimedes> do you agree with my selection of D?
[19:41:20] <x4rchimedes> this is fairly basic level so there is no time consideration
[19:41:30] <Z-module> no, D is wrong
[19:42:01] <Z-module> actually they have TWO distinct answers here that trace out the same correct infinite line!  (but just starting at different places when t = 0).
[19:42:12] <x4rchimedes> ok i think it is A

[19:42:49] <x4rchimedes> right? :(
[19:42:53] <Z-module> I believe they want the second answer choice, yeah, so that you're at the origin (A) at t = 0
[19:42:59] <Z-module> but the first answer gives the same image line
[19:43:02] <^[> Z-module: I think the two answers differ by a translation.
[19:43:05] <Z-module> (as t ranges over all reals)

[19:45:19] <Z-module> they confused line with path
[19:46:03] <Z-module> (They also have the standard basis in the wrong orientation, for me, but that's fine)
[19:46:38] <int-e> and since they specified "line through F", the first answer is somewhat more plausible? ah, hard to say.

If they had  r(t) = (2 - 2t)i + (2 - 2t)k   as a choice, I could see that being the intended answer.

[21:53:48] <Z-module> gigo: to see why your original idea about (a, p - 1) != 1 isn't a criterion, take p = 7. This has 3 as a primitive root, meaning the mult. order of 3 is 6, but 3 is not coprime to 6.
[21:56:31] <Z-module> however, once you know one primitive root g  (for example g = 3 here), you can now find *all* the primitive roots by just taking all possible  g^k  for k in {1,2,...,p-1} that are coprime to p - 1.  So here this only allows k = 1 or 5, and 3^1 = 3 is already a primitive root, and then 3^5 = 243 = 5 (mod 7)  is the other primitive root.

[22:10:21] <Z-module> gigo: but you might have been thinking additively. The multiplicative group {1,2,...,p-1} using multiplication mod p is cyclic, and in the cyclic *additive group {0,1,2,...,p-2} using addition mod p-1, the elements of order p are exactly those things coprime to p-1.  The thing I said earlier about powers of a given primitive root g is the same idea entirely, translated using a group isomorphism  ({0,1,2,...,p-2}, + mod p-1) ->
[22:10:21] <Z-module> ({1,2,...,p-1}, * mod p) that sends 1 to g.
[22:10:58] <Z-module> sorry, I mean the elements of order p-1 in that addtive group
[22:11:11] <Z-module> (things that act as a single generator)

[23:04:57] <johnkeats6> oompf, i think so, because those would be L^1 and continuous functions are dense in L^1 no?
[23:05:40] <johnkeats6> well, that'd just give you an L^1 approximation i guess
[23:06:14] <Dotz0cat> Was I correct when going from line 4 to line 5? https://imgur.com/r9Nsbsf

[23:07:55] <oompf> johnkeats6: But this only gives us convergence in the L1 norm, right?
[23:08:03] <johnkeats6> yeah.
[23:08:24] <johnkeats6> oompf, a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous so you're not gonna get that

[23:09:21] <johnkeats6> you could probably get almost everywhere pointwise convergence. but that sounds less interesting than L^p

[23:57:11] <magic_ninja> I suck so much at the mechanics and arithmetic.
[23:57:38] <Z-module> for one thing,  csc^2  and  sec^2  are not reciprocals of each other
[23:58:24] <magic_ninja> I don't even think csc and sec are recipricals
[23:58:32] <magic_ninja> csc is 1/sinx and sec is 1/cosx right?
