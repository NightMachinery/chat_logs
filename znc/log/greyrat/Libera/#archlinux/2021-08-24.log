[01:28:02] <thurstylark> if you're going for that route, I'd suggest even unplugging your windows drive and installing arch as if your 2nd drive was the only one in there. get settled where arch boots alright, then connect your windows drive again

[03:39:26] <seanicus> but yay doesn't show up in the pacman output either
[03:39:45] <Namarrgon> yay is an aur-helper, so you won't find it in the official repos either
[03:40:01] <seanicus> So am I supposed to add a repository somewhere?
[03:40:13] <seanicus> like apt-sources (or whatever its called) in debian-type systems?

[03:41:15] <Namarrgon> you use yay but have never heard of the AUR?
[03:41:17] <kevr> seanicus: When nothing is returned, it means that pacman was unable to find packages in the mirrors it looks at for your query.

[03:43:07] <seanicus> kevr: right, thats what i figured, but i cant find the documentation on how to get pacman to see the non-official repositories (is a mirror the same as a repository)

[03:44:06] <kevr> seanicus: and yes, a mirror is.. well, it's one endpoint that can satisfy some repositories. Yes, a mirror = repository in how you're thinking about it.

[03:44:46] <Namarrgon> but you still have yay installed on this one?
[03:44:57] <seanicus> That's one of the assumptions.
[03:45:04] <Namarrgon> then it should be in the pacman log
[03:45:04] <seanicus> N.
[03:45:07] <seanicus> This is a fresh install.
[03:45:15] <Namarrgon> why do you have yay installed then?
[03:45:26] <kevr> seanicus: There are two ways that AUR packages can be built. A. Manually with makepkg (i recommend this method for everything) B. Automatically pacman-like with a helper. Using option B generally obscures a LOT of package management from the user, but it's popular.
[03:45:33] <seanicus> That is an assumption you have.  I don't have yay installed.  I'm trying to get it installed.
[03:45:59] <Namarrgon> you said that you used yay to search for octopi, that's my basis for the assumption
[03:46:03] <Namarrgon> read the AUR page
[03:46:13] <kevr> After a package is built locally, it can be installed with pacman -U. I would suggest reading through the article that Namarrgon linked to you, it's quite useful for you to know as an arch linux user.
[03:46:49] <Betal> seanicus: did you used an arch derivate before?
[03:46:59] <seanicus> No.
[03:47:03] <kevr> There are no aur helpers in the official repositories, so you're going to be required to get the package and build it in order to use one.

[05:56:18] <kevr> but the problem is that it can't really configure LAN ips for the network if you aren't connected yet.

[06:04:21] <kevr> euouae: ARP is a protocol used to tell other machines on a network who you are. If you're randomizing a software mac, it's not impossible that it would collide with another physical, real mac
[06:04:37] <kevr> and when that happens, some routers get extremely confused
[06:04:41] <kevr> most of them, even
[06:04:52] <euouae> and then?

[06:05:32] <euouae> ok but what does that imply?
[06:05:43] <kevr> that automating random macs is a bad idea.
[06:05:56] <euouae> I mean as far as the communication in the network goes
[06:06:11] <euouae> What's the best way for a router to handle it?
[06:06:14] <kevr> it means that someone will query for a machine, and it depends on the router which machine it'll choose
[06:06:24] <kevr> if three machines have the same mac on the router, it might just get rid of the older entries it had
[06:06:27] <kevr> or ignore newer duplicated macs
[06:06:34] <kevr> it depends on the router's implementation
[06:06:45] <euouae> so it'll be an issue with packet loss and just inability to communicate
[06:06:50] <kevr> sometimes it keeps all of them around, then just chooses badly.
[06:07:11] <kevr> euouae: right, pretty much
[06:07:42] <kevr> by itself it doesn't mean that packets will be lost, but, that's normally what happens in practice

[07:37:55] <imp> is there any command to install a aur package directly,without going by the process of open the link, clone the repo, cd, makepkg -si, yes
[07:38:36] <mpan> imp: if you ask that question: no. There are AUR helpers, but if you ask that, you are likely going to hurt yourself…
[07:39:49] <Skyfire> Installing too many unofficial packages, even manually, is asking for trouble too.
[07:40:03] <imp> mpan: I can write my own code if is the case ;-)
[07:40:07] <imp> Skyfire: most of them are fonts.
[07:40:37] <SponiX> imp: Google "Arch AUR Helpers" .. you will find there are a handful of them, and after you pick your poison they can make your life easier
[07:40:51] <imp> SponiX: thanks
[07:41:41] <mpan> (most likely harder, as many have learned in the past)
[07:42:17] <SponiX> no bad experiences for me so far.. But I only do less than a handful of AUR things anyway
[07:42:18] <mpan> If you really must, see aurutils and include it in your workflow.

[11:01:34] <euouae> moreover, since one display works, you are in a good spot. It just means that you need to configure your system
[11:01:46] <Nitrousoxide> I might also add that the resolution of the monitor is now different 
[11:01:46] <euouae> so I'd first fix my system to be exactly what I want, and then I'd fix the monitor issue

[13:18:50] <euouae> At least last I checked there wasn't a good solution like dropbox
[13:18:59] <th0rne> Haven't used teams, but from my experience from video games, using "push-to-talk" goes a long way to suppress noise. It also incentivizes you to only say what you need to say since you need to actively enable the mic.

[19:14:25] <thebombzen> MrElendig: how so? I'm not entirely sure how to read /etc/shadow but just viewing the file didn't make it obvious to me
[19:14:37] <MrElendig> second value indicates the hash type

[19:19:02] <thebombzen> it appeared elsewhere in the field, so I was not sure if it was just a coincidence or if it had special meaning. but what I'm gathering is that you're telling me that $6$ is the type and the FOO that follows is the data, is that correct?
[19:19:18] <Namarrgon> "man 5 crypt"
[19:20:00] <thebombzen> ugh this page doens't have a table
[19:20:07] <Namarrgon> oh no

[19:21:45] <thebombzen> I tried that and it said not found, MrElendig, interestingly enough, alhtough searching through it the old-fashioned way (i.e. scrolling until you find it) did tell me it's sha512crypt
[19:22:04] <thebombzen> entereing /$6$ (enter) gave me a pattern not found  (yes I was at the top of the file)

[19:35:18] <AlwaysLivid> but if it's "more" correct and helps people, that'd definitely be interesting
[19:35:19] <nl6720> thebombzen: that's because of https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/67393
[19:35:20] <phrik> Title: FS#67393 : [shadow][pambase] Stop overriding the specified ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs (at bugs.archlinux.org)
[19:35:24] <MrElendig> AlwaysLivid: wiki has examples
[19:35:35] <AlwaysLivid> Yeah, that's what I based the repository on.
[19:35:42] <AlwaysLivid> Oh wait, you're talking about udev rules
[19:35:55] <AlwaysLivid> Yeah, I've seen 'em, they've helped me but I still don't fundamentally understand them perfectly well.
[19:35:57] <AlwaysLivid> I'll see, thanks!
[19:36:05] <MrElendig> AlwaysLivid: could probably do it as a module option instead
[19:36:08] <MrElendig> too
[19:36:19] <AlwaysLivid> if you carry on i'll nerd the heck out :P

[19:36:32] <phrik> Title: Gamepad - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[19:36:33] <nl6720> the wiki page has an example for using a modules option
[19:36:34] <AlwaysLivid> like, module as in kernel module?
[19:36:34] <MrElendig> update your firmware!
[19:36:40] <AlwaysLivid> gotcha!

[19:37:14] <thebombzen> nl6720: no, I mean, the name itself is not the same name as in crypt(5), regardless of override, so I figure there is a translation table somewhere?
[19:37:14] <AlwaysLivid> hm, would this be feasible with passing through a bluetooth adapter to some win10 VM?
[19:37:25] <MrElendig> usb passtrough works fine for that
[19:37:31] <thebombzen> since those files (and /etc/login.defs) calls it "sha512" and crypt(5) calls it sha512crypt
[19:37:32] <AlwaysLivid> yeah makes sense

[22:58:07] <KingShark> i have many leftover bootloader entries of unused former distros. how could i clean them up? my system boots fine into my current installation but for example when i interrupt system startup and chose the select boot device menu (pre efi / bios level), it lists them all

[23:03:30] <KingShark> grazzolini, thanks. two remain. 'Linux Boot Loader' and 'GRUB'. i bet on grub being the current but not 100% sure :D
[23:04:02] <grazzolini> KingShark: for bootorder you want -O
[23:04:07] <grazzolini> iirc
[23:04:38] <KingShark> linux boot manager seems to go first.. ah well whatever i can leave it at two :)
[23:04:41] <grazzolini> KingShark: also, efibootmgr shows which one you're currently booted on, you can safely delete the others you want
[23:04:57] <bmojsej> do I need mbr?

[23:06:53] <KingShark> grazzolini, i am indeed booted into the grub entry. will set it first with -o and delete the other
[23:07:31] <grazzolini> KingShark: just keep in mind you might have some other stuff, like dvd, usb, etc boot
[23:07:44] <grazzolini> KingShark: you might want to re-add them to the order, if you nuked everything
[23:08:06] <susi> KingShark: it shows you Boot Order, efibootmgr -v
