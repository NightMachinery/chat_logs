I found rather different suggestions for this, like using

[01:20:41] <uwharrie> /usr/bin is controlled by the distro's package manager. By mucking around in it, you could either have stuff you install there deleted without warning since the package manager doesn't know about it, or you could overwrite something used by an installed package thereby breaking it
[01:20:41] <stdInOut> djph, please understand I am trying to get informed here, not proving any point, which I can't do.
[01:21:26] <djph> uwharrie: of course -- assuming he's using a package manager .  But yeh, /usr/local/bin would be the better option
[01:21:30] <stdInOut> cockatoodude, to which downloaded packages does this command apply? tarballs? or as well others that include i.e. a .sh script?

[01:22:20] <uwharrie> stdInOut: the common practice is /usr/local/bin for things used by everyone on your system or either old school like ~/bin or new school like ~/.local/bin. You can layer something like GNU stow on top of that for even easier management

[02:37:14] <stdInOut> mlu, I didnt add anything yet in bashrc. this was my question. I have unpacked the tarball and it has an assortment of folders; lib, java, core, etc.. I suppose I need to put 'lib' folder under ~local/lib, and bin under ~local/bin, but where am I going to dump the whole other program-specific folders?

[02:38:24] <Guest11> I am having issues with a linux dualboot and a windows partition. I partitioned my windows install and installed fedora onto the shrunk partion. I enabled grub but dont see the option to boot into windows(only fedora, fedora recovery and uefi firmware settings). The windows partition is still there as I can see it with disk and disk analyzer(this
[02:38:24] <Guest11> shows it as unmounted though). Any suggestions?

[05:00:56] <bitskit> @ayecee a lot of the symbols make sense if you interpret it that way. e.g. why do humans conceive of the heavens as being "above"? For the same reason that thoughts come off the top of the head. The heavens are occupied by stars, which are named after gods. And that which ascends to the heavens (birds) represent enlightenment and knowledge
[05:01:11] <bitskit> It's all subconscious symbolism.

[05:05:10] <Codaraxis_> That said... I'm now going to look up Lmod, because I'm trying to move us away from maintaining over a dozen environment source files for different tools, 80% of which is maintained, and was going to use environment modules

[05:23:12] <rbox> i did an analysis and i *think* nothing important was deleted... he got a bunch of errors on stuff he dindt have permission on and immediatley did ctrl c... the directory's mtime wasn't changed... so no top level directory was deleted, i did an rm -i to see what direcotires it would have traveresed... it first hit the directory he got the errors on, and then it hit another directory
[05:23:21] <Codaraxis_> ananke, I guess, within a work environment, do people just use whatever tools are available as opposed to building them for themselves when the package manager doesn't have a user-local install option?
[05:23:34] <rbox> the 2nd directory was still there, so worse case, it deleted some files in that first directory, not a big deal, and some files in that second, questionable but probably okay

IMHO using @reboot in the root user's crontab is skanky way of implementing a service, especially if other things depend on it; use a sysv-init or systemd service definition instead.

[11:42:44] <katp32> without root you cannot as far as I know, that would be a security liability
[11:43:50] <katp32> if you wanted to you could create a unix-socket-proxy of sorts; write a program which will open its own unix socket, and when a process connects to it then it will open a connection with the real unix socket and forward all the data between them. that way you can read the data going back and forth

I get to unlock the drive with the encryption password and then I'm stuck at "ACPI BIOS Error (bug): A_AML BUFFER LIMIT, Field [TBF3] at bit offset/length 258048/32768 exceeds size of target Buffer (266240 bits) (20190816/dsopcode-198)". Any Ideas? It's a Xubuntu on a thinkpad. I can also paste the other messages on screen.

This usually indicaste noise on the line .I've checked with an oscilloscope and the signal seems clean.

[21:11:38] <Bruda> Yea you can create the files yourself if you know how.
[21:11:39] <ayecee> it's possible to create them manually, but the manually created ones would not go in that directory.
[21:12:17] <ayecee> they might go in ~/.local/share/applications or something, or maybe even on your desktop

[21:59:55] <NeoFAT32> How To Build And Install
[21:59:55] <NeoFAT32> ========================
[21:59:55] <NeoFAT32> Build
[21:59:55] <NeoFAT32> -----
[21:59:55] <NeoFAT32> There are 2 ways to build from source:
[21:59:56] <NeoFAT32> * Using QtCreator:
[21:59:58] <NeoFAT32>   1. Download and install the latest version of QtCreator;
[22:00:00] <NeoFAT32>     
[22:00:02] <NeoFAT32>   2. Open "f3-qt.pro" with QtCreator;
[22:00:05] *** Quits: mowcat (~mowcat@2a00:23c5:d190:1901:f22f:74ff:fe77:1e1c) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:00:06] *** Joins: moberg (~moberg@luke.millenniumfalcon.org)
[22:00:06] <NeoFAT32>     
[22:00:08] <NeoFAT32>   3. Compile the project.
[22:00:10] <ayecee> this is to make me happy?
[22:00:10] <NeoFAT32> * Using qmake:
[22:00:12] <NeoFAT32>   1. Download and install qmake. There might be other dependencies needed for qmake. For example, under Ubuntu you can:
[22:00:15] <NeoFAT32>             sudo apt-get install g++
[22:00:17] <NeoFAT32>             sudo apt-get install qt5-default
[22:00:19] <NeoFAT32>   2. Switch to the source directory and run qmake:
[22:00:21] <NeoFAT32>     
[22:00:23] <NeoFAT32>             cd f3-qt/
[22:00:24] <ayecee> maybe if it gets you kickbanned, it might
[22:00:24] <compdoc> are you?
[22:00:25] <NeoFAT32>             qmake
[22:00:27] <NeoFAT32>     
[22:00:29] <NeoFAT32>   3. Actually build the project:
[22:00:31] <NeoFAT32>     
[22:00:33] <NeoFAT32>             make
[22:00:37] <NeoFAT32>         
[22:00:39] <NeoFAT32> Install
[22:00:41] <NeoFAT32> -------
[22:00:43] <NeoFAT32> The built executable "f3-qt" can be launched directly (either from terminal or file manager), without further configuration of environmental variables.
[22:00:46] <NeoFAT32> **To make the program function properly, you need also install the latest version of f3.**
[22:00:48] <NeoFAT32> So here we are.
[22:00:50] <NeoFAT32> How to compile ?
[22:00:57] <NeoFAT32> Maybe you wanted me to read "How To Build And Install" part.

[22:02:29] <NeoFAT32> Ok ignored.

[22:03:44] <bertvvvs> plox
[22:03:45] <nq> hodapp: but using SFML to RenderRectangle which makes a GPU call for every pixel.. that's too much
[22:04:25] <hodapp> nq: don't know what SFML is, but this is why people opt for something like SDL or in some cases just getting an OpenGL surface
[22:04:27] <NeoFAT32> hodapp To repeating the same question ? I don't know if he wanted me to read the "How To Build And Install" line or to do the first and 2nd step of the tutorial.

[22:04:59] <ayecee> sure seems like it
[22:05:18] <nq> hodapp: the OpenGL surface is a CPU-memory image, essentially ?

[22:05:57] <NeoFAT32> Thanks you, it was really helpful.
[22:06:13] <ayecee> why, how do you start the car
[22:06:20] <nq> hodapp: well, if I wanted direct access to the video framebuffer, how could I go about it ? I suppose one way is in userspace with an API and another would be in kernel with a driver ?

[22:07:21] <NeoFAT32> "How to reboot the computer ? - Reboot the computer."

[22:08:47] <suid_dumpable> nq: the lowlevel framebuffer api would be opening /dev/fb0, run some ioctl() on it to get info like resolution, mmap() it and do things on the mmap'ed area

[23:06:50] <nq> hodapp: well, it's really about adaptability; many design patterns are about focusing on some particular thing and specializing / removing redundancy as much as possible; I am more passioned about a system that DOES have the overhead of adaptability (being programmable at a hardware level as well), and then the additional overhead of emulating any other design of choice
[23:06:58] <ayecee> computation in neural networks is more an emergent property of their structure and not something that the individual nodes do.
[23:06:59] <matii> phogg: would a few numbers increase the entropy enough to make it worth it? i.e. " fe3ncing attitude dust5y ..."
[23:07:35] <hodapp> nq: why would you *start* with this at the hardware level before first simulating it at the software level and seeing if the very concept can even be made to work?
[23:07:36] <phogg> matii: notionally yes, normally we divide it by character class (adding numbers adds +10 characters to the pool of possible choices)
[23:08:06] <nq> matii: unless the attacker knows that on 3rd position you have alpha-numeric, then them searching using just alpha will not be enough
[23:08:09] <phogg> matii: if you only use real space-delimited words then you are vulnerable to more attacks than if you don't

[23:09:02] <phogg> nq: but how does the attacker know you *didn't* use numbers to begin with?
[23:09:18] <ayecee> matii: hashcat and similar have transforms that take the dictionary words and add or substitute characters, because it's such a low-cost operation when brute forcing with a gpu.
[23:09:26] <nq> phogg: indeed, that information makes the difference
[23:09:28] <phogg> they pretty much have to try everything if brute forcing, although starting with lower case alphabetic could get you a win faster
[23:09:53] <nq> it's just that information pertaining to cracking a password is not just of the nature of the state-space's size
[23:10:06] <ayecee> matii: for that reason, adding another word probably has more value than these hard to remember additions and substitutions.

[23:10:55] <ayecee> even if you do only use dictionary words, 6-10 words is a huge space to search.
[23:11:16] <phogg> it's all about entropy, and entropy goes up really fast if you increase length
[23:11:22] <phogg> 8->16 is way more than double

[23:17:06] <hodapp> because on one side their competition is software that is even more flexible and CPUs that were made to run generic things fast, and on the other side their competition is highly optimized hardware that is already faster at the task it was designed for which might be close enough
