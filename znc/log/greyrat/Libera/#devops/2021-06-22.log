[15:02:50] <shad> Hi guys. We've kernel panicked on a big server (4To disk,48cpu,200gb ram). Our grafana node exporter monitoring shows that minutes before the crash, the "RAM Cache + Buffer" was at 170Gb. I also recovered the kernel logs in /var/log/kern.log
[15:03:13] <shad> What do we do with this information, and what can we do in order to _not_ panic anymore ?
[15:05:48] <rawtaz> i'd suggest trying to recover log files for whatever other things ran on that server, too
[15:07:54] <shad> almost everything running on this server is inside Docker
[15:10:17] <shad> in syslog i found this right before the panic logs though : "dockerd: stream copy error: reading from a closed fifo"
[15:11:41] <rawtaz> the kern.log doesnt have actual drash info in it does it? i mean, you'd want to find the stack trace and investigate what it crashed on
[15:16:50] <shad> https://pastecode.io/s/0wrxi31hy3
[15:17:14] <shad> seems to be a swap problem, but i don't know what it is nor what happened with it
[15:20:45] <rawtaz> what makes you say it's a swap problem?

[15:21:44] <shad> Some google fu led me to this where the guy has the same kind of stacktrace as I + call trace starts crashing in "scan_swap_map/get_swap_pages"
