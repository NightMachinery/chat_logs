[05:49:23] <sney> hrm, I thought it was archived
[05:49:40] <transhumanist> so I can or cant use the netinstall cd?
[05:50:01] <sney> probably not the netinstall, unless expert mode lets you set a mirror (I don't remember)

[05:50:37] <greycat> Haven't tested that myself.

[11:52:42] <tjcarter> The reason it doesn't work is xfce4-terminal tries to use a PC speaker bell (via same mechanism as xkbbell) and that's not configured.

[12:57:59] <Urk> can someone provide some guidance on copying the Thunderbird profile to another user?  I am trying to make sense out of but doubt I have the syntax right for copying http://www.linux-databook.info/?page_id=5700
[12:58:45] <ansgar> But who knows if software is read for that. I suspect not given the problems with 25-year-old IPv6 or Unicode in e-mail (or spaces in mail addresses or ...)

[13:13:34] <tjcarter> so how is file: resolved if not locally? I guess on windows it'd be used for UNC paths

[13:14:50] <Urk> I copied the profile from the other user, and now the program don't work.
[13:15:17] <Urk> Maybe I should look up the pID and try kiling it?

[22:27:24] <tjcarter> I wasn't sure how to get Calamares to preserve my 30TB setup, I didn't feel like waiting for a restore from backup unless I _had_ to, and I know the old debian-installer doesn't like to open an existing LUKS device to use what's inside, only create new ones.

[23:02:21] <jelly> tjcarter: we replace partman in d-i with our own script that sets up disks without partitions, perhaps you could do something similar and keep using d-i
[23:03:12] <jelly> last time I looked it was not possible to have a LVM PV on whole disk, and stupid partman always created partitions
[23:03:36] <tjcarter> jelly: if I could have had cryptsetup's bits when booting netinst, it would've been sufficient. Or if I could actually run d-i from a live image

[23:04:29] <jelly> you have to install cryptsetup bits from udeb and then you have them at disposal

[23:47:52] <blackop> hi
[23:48:18] <blackop> how can i install debian on a windows machine installed uefi?
[23:48:53] <blackop> debian will be on separate partition but will GRUB work after installing debian?
[23:48:54] <greycat> In general, shrink the Windows partition so it's not taking up the entire disk, then make Debian partitions in the free space.
[23:49:05] <blackop> greycat: that s what i will do
[23:49:33] <blackop> i didnt install yet but i will install win10 first and then debian as i usually do but this machine is uefi
[23:49:43] <blackop> before i all installed bios machines
[23:49:47] <blackop> not uefi before
[23:49:55] <greycat> It works on UEFI as well.
[23:49:57] <blackop> i wonder if uefi will make any difference?
[23:50:02] <blackop> ok then
[23:50:13] <blackop> so i can go on as my usual installation habbit

[23:51:01] <blackop> should i create separate partition for GRUB?
[23:51:06] <blackop> 500mb or so
[23:51:16] <greycat> You mean /boot?  You can.
[23:51:43] <blackop> can i use just 2 separate partition root (/) and /boot ?

[23:53:25] <greycat> Ask yourself why you want a separate /boot in the first place.  Is it because of encryption?

[23:56:55] <tjcarter> blackop: What do you intend to live in /boot? GRUB and a couple of kernels and initramfses so you can use LUKS? My /boot is HUGE, but I have isos living there too.
