[00:18:13] <pyzozord> well not really. it's about SDL2_ttf. in the versrion provided in ubuntu it renders emojis in monochrome, the latest version renders in color but the latest version requires a SDL version that is not yet available in ubuntu. So I need to build both myself
[00:20:05] <Guest007> sounds like 17% of too-much-work.
[00:20:22] <pyzozord> I made it and it all works, but It's weird that my final binary when I pass it through ldd it outputs that sdl2.so and sd2_ttf.so paths lead to /home/me/Projects/prj/

[00:30:44] <Guest007> pyzozord, because if you go `cd $HOME; /home/me/Projects/prj2/mybinary` the system needs to know where the libraries are. The searching is not going to be dependent on being in the directory $HOME

[05:48:22] <droid3> hey guys i am curious in most languages i can declare a double and a float  32 bit or 64 bit precision. Yet we have avx , sse as we talked about these registers are xmms , ymms ,...etc which are large like 256 bits and bigger 
[05:48:40] <Caffeinated> haefgajghafgae
[05:48:51] <droid3> So is there any built in double double data type in c/c++ , java ,..etc
[05:49:08] <droid3> To utilize larger then 64 bit floating point ???
[05:49:10] <Caffeinated> have you read up on this or even searched?
[05:49:21] <Caffeinated> or is this another 3 hour session...
[05:50:27] <droid3> no i mean why would they make avx extensions or older sse extensions only to work with 64bit floating point. 
[05:51:29] <Twix> in C/C++ there is `long double`, which usually is a 80-Bit float
[05:51:32] <droid3> Sure you can parallel alot of 64 bit floating point arithemtic
[05:51:46] <PlanckWalk> I thought it was pretty clear last time that AVX etc only represent tuples of 64-bit floating point.
[05:51:56] <Twix> doing stuff in parallel is the whole point of sse/avx ...
[05:52:05] <droid3> But you think you want to make them have bigger precision and bigger number ranges why stay at 64 bit floating point
[05:52:10] <webNET4> the v stands for vector
[05:52:10] <PlanckWalk> Yes, the v in AVX stands for "Vector"
[05:52:36] <PlanckWalk> droid3: Already told you, there is next to no use for 128-bit or 256-bit floating point numbers.
[05:52:57] <droid3> ya true but why stop at 64 bit registers for floating point arithmetic
[05:53:02] <PlanckWalk> droid3: Already told you, there is next to no use for 128-bit or 256-bit floating point numbers.
[05:53:03] <webNET4> can it do 16-bit floats
[05:53:09] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[05:53:12] <webNET4> that would be cool

[05:54:07] <PlanckWalk> droid3: There is next to no use for *specifically limited to 128-bit* floating point.
[05:54:13] <PlanckWalk> (Same for 256-bit)
[05:54:20] <droid3> But its just natural to think that computer registers are going to get bigger and bigger we went from 32 bit to 64 bit next would be 128 bit ...etc

[05:54:40] <Twix> bignum and decimal is something different than floats. And you use them for other purposes than floats
[05:54:52] <leduyquang753> You are only looking at the benefits without looking at the big costs associated.
[05:54:55] <Twix> and you have the long doubles
[05:54:56] <droid3> So why didnt we just stay at 32 bit machines instead of 64 bit machines
[05:54:59] <PlanckWalk> There's 64-bit which covers essentially all floating point calculations that don't require arbitrary precision.
[05:55:12] *** Quits: ugly (~ugly@2804:431:d77e:3a94:9f46:4aa9:410d:1bcc) (Client Quit)
[05:55:39] <PlanckWalk> For the same reason as floating point: 32 bits is a bit cramped.
[05:55:46] <droid3> well making larger fpu means we dont have to offload it to slower software bignum libraries
[05:55:56] <PlanckWalk> There are lots of things in the real world that need more than 32 bits, but fit in 64 bits
[05:55:58] <Twix> bignum != float
[05:55:59] *** Joins: ugly (~ugly@2804:431:d77e:3a94:9f46:4aa9:410d:1bcc)
[05:56:40] <PlanckWalk> There are some things that need 128-bit integers, though not very many, and we may go to 128-bit CPUs
[05:56:43] <droid3> i am aware of this obviously. I was just asking about why we dont increase register size anymore. Like 64 bit seems to be where we like.
[05:56:50] <PlanckWalk> There is next to nothing that needs 128-bit floating point.
[05:57:11] <leduyquang753> Because we have yet to exceed the 64-bit limits frequently enough to need to increase.
[05:57:17] <Twix> droid3, because the costs of those registers and alus do not rise linear
[05:57:21] <Caffeinated> no median
[05:57:31] <Twix> a 128 bit alu is really big, really slow and consumes a lot of power
[05:57:37] <Twix> and this for nearly no use
[05:58:00] <droid3> ok all leave it at that but it seems it be cool to make a bignum hardware analogy to some ridiculous size in hardware. Obviously couldnt do it to the extent of software .
[05:58:06] <PlanckWalk> Yep, doubling ALU size slows it down rather a lot, makes it occupy substantially more die space, and more power.
[05:58:44] <PlanckWalk> If that only gets used for <1% of computation, that's a net loss.

[06:11:08] <Caffeinated> whem my coding is what?
[06:11:11] <droid3> Will it be a sse instruction , avx 256 , 512 ,...gpu .
[06:11:23] <leduyquang753> It's the compiler which decides which is best.
[06:12:14] <phogg> but it probably won't decide to use the gpu
[06:12:19] <droid3> ok so if i am not coding in asm i have to kind of trust the compiler optimization to make it in the best place possible. Or to use external asm.
[06:12:44] <phogg> or inline asm

[06:20:55] <PlanckWalk> droid3: If you don't specify your particular CPU's architecture, the compiler will likely default to a more "generic" CPU
[06:21:27] <PlanckWalk> E.g. for x86-64, it will probably generate SSE2 instructions because they're common to all x64-64 CPUs.
[06:21:36] <PlanckWalk> Err x86-64
[06:22:17] <PlanckWalk> If it generates AVX-512 instructions then it won't run on lots of CPUs in that family.

[07:35:02] <[itchyjunk]> "Note that deciding whether a type is inhabited is undecidable."
[07:35:05] <[itchyjunk]> excuse me?
[07:35:10] <[itchyjunk]> As in the halting problem?
[07:35:38] <oldlaptop> that is usually what "undecidable" means, yes
[07:37:25] <[itchyjunk]> Halting problem is everywhere
[07:37:31] <[itchyjunk]> can't take a step without running into it
[07:37:32] <PlanckWalk> Yep, even in formal logic.
[07:38:10] <[itchyjunk]> So i don't know what `Inductive` is supposed to mean in the `Inductive nat : Set :=` is
[07:38:18] <[itchyjunk]> the type of nat is Set
[07:38:24] <[itchyjunk]> i think
[07:38:46] <oldlaptop> "undecidable" doesn't mean it *is* the halting problem or something, although proving that solving some problem would require solving the halting problem first is a common way to prove undecidability

[07:39:37] <[itchyjunk]> right, halting problem is undecidable
[07:39:47] <[itchyjunk]> so it would be in the same category as the halting problem
[07:39:55] <PlanckWalk> It just means that there does not exist an algorithm that alwasy halts and gives the correct result.
[07:40:02] <[itchyjunk]> we could decide in a different system how ever that works
[07:40:21] <[itchyjunk]> we are in the "can't prove everything true to be true but can't prove anything false to be true either" system
[07:41:07] <oldlaptop> (It *is* often the case that problem is known to be undecidable because it's provably equivalent to the halting problem, though, or a solution provably requires a solution to the halting problem)

[09:31:38] <webNET4> PEYA!!
[09:31:57] <[itchyjunk]> PEYA!
[09:32:46] <webNET4> Qed.
[09:32:49] <webNET4> wut
[09:33:03] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Is "rewrite IHn." supposed to mean something?
[09:33:10] * arahael hands webNET4 a cookie.  Yeah, we know. :)
[09:33:15] <CoderGuy> so where do I have to look to know if the name is taken?
[09:33:20] <[itchyjunk]> rewrite Induction hypothesis for n, i think.
[09:33:22] <InPhase> CoderGuy: Google.
[09:33:24] <[itchyjunk]> i am not 100% sure.
[09:33:35] <CoderGuy> just what like the name + coding library?
[09:33:35] <[itchyjunk]> but that's how you `user` the assumption in the induction hypothesis
[09:33:47] <[itchyjunk]> basically how i get to use n+ 0 = 0
[09:33:53] <[itchyjunk]> oop
[09:33:57] <[itchyjunk]> n + 0 = n
[09:34:05] <[itchyjunk]> so prove S n + 0 = S n
[09:34:09] <InPhase> CoderGuy: I do something like name, then name with program, then name with library, or name with software.  If nothing comes up in the first pages, consider it not found.
[09:34:19] <CoderGuy> hmmm
[09:34:56] <webNET4> -simpl.    ORLY?
[09:35:08] <[itchyjunk]> - is to start a goal
[09:35:11] <CoderGuy> I found multiple libraries lol
[09:35:14] <[itchyjunk]> simpl is to simplify stuff
[09:35:29] <[itchyjunk]> so if i have 1  + 2 and i apply simpl. it becomes 3
[09:35:38] <InPhase> CoderGuy: Maybe don't try to name your library "Apple".
[09:35:46] <[itchyjunk]> simpl is simplify and not simple :P
[09:35:48] <webNET4> im proud of you man, i would have just closed my browser and gave up when seeing such code
[09:35:53] <CoderGuy> lol
[09:35:59] <webNET4> you pulled through with this one for sure
[09:36:23] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i was supposed tp sleep 3 hours ago
[09:36:24] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[09:36:32] <[itchyjunk]> i am so tired, i can't fall asleep now
[09:36:34] <CoderGuy> okay maybe i'll give it a first name

[12:55:11] <mrig> Buy detecting most suspicious activity.
[12:55:20] <audiocat> mrig, that's what virustotal was for
[12:55:34] <audiocat> it uses like 50 different antivirus vendors to see if theres a virus
[12:55:45] <mrig> and check the sha of your binaries
[12:55:48] <audiocat> er, 65 vendors
[12:56:26] <mrig> if the hash is the same and is still a valid type of hash, then the software is safe to install
[12:56:42] <arahael> For some value of "safe", anyway. :)

[14:33:04] <user51> so where does "defactoring" come from?
[14:33:09] <GeDaMo> OK, it's actually "factoring": "The terms "factoring" and "factoring out" have been used in this way in the Forth community since at least the early 1980s." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring#History

[15:16:51] <GeDaMo> "But around 8,000 years ago in what's now Turkey — just when humans were  starting to milk newly domesticated cows, goats and sheep — mutations  near the gene that produces the lactase enzyme started becoming more  frequent. And around the same time, adult lactose tolerance developed.  The mutation responsible for that may be between 2,000 and 20,000 years  old; estimates vary."
[15:17:24] <edgar-rft> I don't want to deny that there are genetically caused alleries but lots of food allegies today come from the fact that we eat too much pre-sterilized supermarket food.

I would probably *still* recommend a programmer to learn C first, then other languages. really the simple stuff like float square(float number_to_be_squared) { return (number_to_be_squared*number_to_be_squared); } and int main() { square(3); } of course 
[16:14:13] <PamiPetteri> there should be a prototype first, and the function definition should come after int main() { ... ; return 0; } the prototype could be float square(float number_to_be_squared); and it would come before int main() { ...; return 0; }

[16:23:18] <PamiPetteri> absolutely the only reason I sometimes use C++ for my short practice programs is that cout << "string\n"; is so easy, and so is cout << variable << "\n"; I have to use printf("%s", string); and printf("%f\n", var); or printf("%d\n", var); or printf("%lf\n", var); in C. or printf("%c\n", ch); cout is an object defined in <iostream> and printf(...) is a function defined in <stdio.h>

[16:25:34] <PamiPetteri> novns: I started with BASICA, moved on to Turbo Pascal, tried to learn some INT calls in x86 assembly, then moved on to C and C++ with Borland C 3.1. My Pascal compiler was eventually TP7.0. I guess I did not do much programming C=64 BASIC nor the Microsoft version of Basic, I used BASICA.

[16:32:29] <PamiPetteri> imperative, and it is a standard since the 1970's.

[21:23:43] <pyzozord> oh sorry, this one is specific for irssi, but doesn't really matter, the concept is the same
[21:24:23] <pyzozord> it's a bash oneliner that creates a new tmux session and once that session is over it keeps attaching to any session it cak find until there are no more sessions
[21:24:43] <pyzozord> I tend to have at least two sessions: one for work, and one for irssi, music, nethack etc
[21:25:01] <mrig> great for keeping contexts appart.

[21:38:20] <mrig> I must say, the way that suckless terminal deals with cut and past is pretty cool, was a little concerned about how it would work but it seems to be better than the gnome-terminal.

[22:39:46] *** Joins: brabrax (~brabrax@user/brabrax)
[22:40:01] <jinsun> so you get 3 levels, and even if that is enough, you are left with only 40 characters more
[22:40:30] <jinsun> so you will have to use very short variable names to fit
[22:41:09] <mercenary> Those first tabs (class, function level) do not add much clarity. So let us use bounded exponential tabs: 1,2,4,8,8,....
