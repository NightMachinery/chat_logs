[12:35:26] <easymac> i'm experiencing this: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4098
[12:35:48] <easymac> should i make a new issue or add to this one w/ the bug report format?
[12:36:40] <easymac> oh, found a fix. nvm
[12:37:32] <johncs> the old version might not know what the new version expects, but the new version could know what to expect from the old version
[12:39:24] <johncs> definitely a possible thing to make. doesn't really solve any real problems but could probably appeal to a certain kind of geek (like me 😅!)
[12:40:30] <easymac> sounds neat to me 
[12:45:49] <Activ8> easymac what was the fox
[12:45:51] <Activ8> fix*
[12:46:25] <easymac> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4221
[12:47:00] <Activ8> MaxLeiter added this to the 4.3.0 milestone on 5 Jun - sweet so it's coming to 4.3.0 nice.
[12:48:24] <Activ8> sorry for the ping, copy paste

[21:50:21] <johncs> moof: funny that no one mentioned kiwi bnc. I guess it doesn't look too active.

[21:50:54] <johncs> I think the widget's biggest problem will be moderation. Hoping that someone's who
[21:51:26] <johncs> 's working on the edit/delete ircv3 spec has some patches I can pull in.
[21:52:01] *** Awoobis is now known as `Awoobis`
[21:59:50] <bookworm> kiwi is fairly active actually
[22:00:38] <bookworm> they have a bunch of things in plugins, outside of the core

[23:13:36] <mooff> re: right click menu, i meant generally in the main messages view to get some actions for the channel
[23:13:54] <mooff> probably just when there is no text selected at all
[23:14:48] <mooff> i also would appreciate if the pointer did not use the text selection cursor when not hovering over text

[23:16:50] <johncs> I'm pretty befuddled trying to get the test suite of https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable to run. If anyone feels like taking a whack at it I could use a second brain I think 😅. Gonna step away from it for awhile.
[23:17:00] <mooff> and possibly even when doing so, except when clicking the mouse and dragging to select text 🤓
[23:17:32] <mooff> ^ it would help to make it feel more like a native app
[23:18:34] <mooff> (i know the distinction between native and non-native is getting more and more academic. but at least in terms of UI, it's a key part of the 'feel' of desktop applications :)
[23:19:15] <mooff> johncs: i'll give it a go 😅

[23:32:59] <johncs> Thank you! I wish they had some chat channel I could ask questions on. I don't think I'd get a response if I asked in their issue tracker.
[23:33:47] <johncs> I might just try asking on a general js or vue help channel at some point if you don't have any luck either
