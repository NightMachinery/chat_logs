[00:08:30] <iDrougge> jj5: The 1st index should be 1.
[00:08:47] <iDrougge> Ideally, index boundaries should be arbitrary, as in Ada.
[00:09:54] <jj5> I didn't mean indexes, I meant enumerations, such as in C#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum
[00:09:54] <mockturtle> [ Enumeration types - C# reference ] - docs.microsoft.com
[00:10:23] <iDrougge> "Enumeration" is an overloaded term. :)
[00:10:41] <jj5> yup, so are all the other terms :)
[00:10:46] <iDrougge> Don't enums start at whatever you specify for the starting index in every known language?
[00:10:52] <jj5> ever "overloaded" is an overloaded term!
[00:10:53] <iDrougge> starting item, I mean.
[00:11:04] <jj5> s/ever/even/
[00:11:22] <jj5> in C# they start at zero if you don't specify
[00:11:34] <jj5> my question is if you should specify to start from 1 instead of 0
[00:12:12] <iDrougge> Start at what is the indexing base in your language, so 0 for C-style languages.

[00:49:58] <Forty-Bot> what are some strategies to deal with atomic integer rollover?
[00:50:19] <Forty-Bot> (specifically on a 32-bit platform)
[00:50:38] <Forty-Bot> first strategy is to just use a lock and a regular integer
[00:51:38] <Forty-Bot> second is to assume that the integer won't be incremented too much at once and create a threshold
[00:52:31] <Forty-Bot> if you increment the integer and it's over the threshold, increment some additional integer (e.g. the upper 32 bits) and then clear the original integer
[00:53:26] <Forty-Bot> and when reading, if you get a value over the threshold wait until it's been reset before reading the upper 32 bits
[00:54:06] *** Quits: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar) (Quit: :wq)
[00:54:27] <Forty-Bot> third is to keep track of the largest value you read and if you see a value under that assume there has been a rollover and increment some additional integer
[00:55:02] <Forty-Bot> I think you need some locking/additional synchronization for this last one on the read side (and of course you have to read often enough to catch an overflow)
[00:55:16] <Forty-Bot> am I missing anything?
[00:56:00] <kline> use an integer wide enough to hold all possible values
[00:56:17] <kline> if you need 33 bits, then use a 64 bit wide integer
[00:57:36] <kline> hopefully whatever you are using provides tools for arbitrary wide atomic ints, even if it means hiding away software implementation details on platforms that dont provide it in hardware
[00:57:37] <Forty-Bot> typically only word-sized ints are atomic if an arch supports atomics
[00:57:46] <Forty-Bot> so on a 32-bit platform you get 32-bit ints
[00:57:55] <Forty-Bot> which can overflow rather easily
[00:58:38] <Forty-Bot> and I am the guy writing the tool to abstract over that small int
[00:58:48] <kline> lol

[01:00:09] <kline> cb, its ok but my god there are aspects of it that are annoying
[01:00:31] <kline> in the past i ended up with three different Instant types with overlapping but incompatible uses
[01:00:36] <cb> sure, there's merits to both approaches
[01:01:16] <kline> it feels like theres a healthy middle point where there are lots of types inside of the stdlib so at least everyone is on common ground with what you do to them
[01:04:50] <cb> anything with lots of interchange, yeah
[01:05:05] <cb> perhaps things that need to compose should be in the stdlib
[01:05:10] <cb> and things that don't can be outside of it
[01:05:50] <edk> my personal benchmark would be whether it's practical to write a largeish, useful app using only the stdlib

[22:41:47] <vladimyr> That's encouraging to hear
[22:41:51] <Ori_B> yeah; I could probably switch to arm -- my point is more that I don't feel any pressure to.
[22:42:01] <Ori_B> one day I'll play with it, I guess.
[22:42:04] <vladimyr> Might finally place an order for that pinebook
[22:42:08] <Ori_B> kind of want some higher end boards, though
[22:42:32] <technomancy> I just dusted off my pine64 to run my IRC server I've been hacking on the past few days
[22:42:43] <Ori_B> would be neat if there was a good arm laptop that had trackpoint + high res screen + awesome keyboard.

[22:43:17] <bsandro> oh wait no, I read "trackpad"

[22:43:36] <vladimyr> With big enough hammer everything is possible :^)
[22:43:43] <technomancy> you're not gonna get a laptop with an awesome keyboard
[22:43:55] <vladimyr> True
[22:44:04] <Ori_B> technomancy: even aweome in laptop terms would be worth it.
[22:44:23] <vladimyr> Also true!
[22:44:34] <Ori_B> my X260 is currently acceptable in most ways, so I'm not in a rush to move.
[22:44:48] <Ori_B> but I don't know what I do when it's time to move to the next box.
[22:44:55] <companion_cube> maybe lenovo will do an ARM thinkpad at some point?
[22:44:56] <technomancy> yeah my biggest hesitance with buying my latest laptop was knowing it wouldn't be that much better than an old thinkpad
