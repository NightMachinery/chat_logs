[00:08:27] <eviroo> Yea I have no problem with that. My problem is just how the simplification is made to the final answer. Without expanding the powers, how do calculate the relevant coefficients for the relevant factors and then group the fast-growing ones into a bounded function.
[00:08:39] <eviroo> If there were no powers in the above expression it would be easy.
[00:08:51] <int-e> in particular, (cos(x)-1)/2 =  -x^2/4 + x^4/48 + x^6B3(x)
[00:09:46] <int-e> it's tedious; you expand and collect equal powers
[00:10:57] <somiaj> ls
[00:11:18] <int-e> it's also possible that there's a mistake in that answer; it's not like I actually did that tedious computation
[00:12:25] <int-e> (But then again my computer says it's correct. 1/48 - 1/32 = -1/96)
[00:12:46] <eviroo> int-e yea but I don’t think they expand them because they just say ”we only need to calculate the coefficients in detail for 1,x^2,x^3,x^4..”, not sure what that means tho. Yea that’s the right answer -1/96, I just saw it.
[00:13:15] <eviroo> Then they group everything else in a bounded function multiplied by x^5.
[00:13:44] <eviroo> ln(1 + cosx) = ln2 - x^2/4 - x^4/96 + x^5B(x)

[00:43:16] <Yukkuri> in my current understanding, the inductive checks appears to be a boolean expression testing that result of expression when applied to an incremented input is satisfying required conditions, e.g. f(x) = (2*x-1) % 2 == 1 that is applied to several input x. is the limiting factor the inability to use the recursion, e.g. same f calling itself with derived argument for proof to be considered valid?

[00:48:55] <riv> no its not correct
[00:49:19] <riv> a inductive proof is a very specific thing where you have a base case and an induction step (that part proves P(n+1) using P(n))
[00:49:23] <riv> 'P'
[00:49:30] <riv> 'P' can be any logical statement
[00:50:10] <riv> to prove collatz by induction, you would need to formulate it logically like  Collatz(n)  means that the collatz statement is true for the number n
[00:50:24] <riv> then you can prove Collatz(1) and also Collatz(n) => Collatz(n+1)
[00:50:47] <riv> but Collatz(n) => Collatz(n+1) is the hard part and nobody has proved this, it doesn't even seem to be the right proof strategy
[00:51:49] <Yukkuri> isn't 'P' accepts an argument and returns true if it satisifes the conditions?
[00:51:58] <riv> almost
[00:52:05] <riv> it's just slightly different from that
[00:52:17] <riv> a function takes an input and returns a value like true or false
[00:52:47] <riv> a logical proposition (which is what P is) takes an input and *is a claim* which can either be proven or disproven - or maybe it is too hard to prove
[00:53:02] <riv> this is kind of a subtle distinction, so hopefully it makes sense?

[03:36:13] <Hello72> suppose 100 differently-sized marbles are randomly distributed into 20 buckets. i want to sort the buckets into ones that happen to have bigger marbles and ones that happen to have smaller marbles. i have thought of some metrics for this sorting: 1. average marble size; 2. maximum marble size; 3. average of top N marble sizes in each bucket; 4. some kind of weighted average? e.g. 1x the largest
[03:36:14] <Hello72> marble size plus 0.8x the second largest marble plus 0.6x the third largest, etc. are there other common metrics for this problem? is there a name for this type of problem?
[03:37:12] <PlanckWalk> Not specifically that problem, no.  There are names for things vaguely involved in that sort of problem
[03:37:59] <PlanckWalk> But there are lots of things that *might* be involved, depending upon why you want those statistics.

[03:46:23] <PlanckWalk> In the end, there are about 10^130 possibilities and so lots of ways to try to collapse those into metrics that summarize useful information.

[03:55:15] <Hello72> actually i think i was wondering if there is some kind of chart for this application, if i want a pictoral rather than purely numeric output. i thought of a stacked bar chart where each column is one bucket with each marble being one bar, sorted vertically by size. unfortunately that returns me to the original problem of sorting the chart horizontally

[08:35:19] <greenbagels> lf94: you can prove x is irrational for more than one x in the same exact manner; does this satisfy your requirement?
[08:35:37] <lf94> prove to me x is irrational
[08:36:00] <greenbagels> So euclid's famous proof that sqrt(2) is irrational goes like this
[08:36:28] <greenbagels> suppose sqrt(2) is irrational; then there exist integers p, q such that sqrt(2)=p/q, and without loss of generality we can assume p and q have no common factors
[08:37:30] <lf94> what's the proof here
[08:37:46] <greenbagels> square both sides to get 2 = p^2 / q^2, which means q^2 divides p^2; but this can only happen if p divides q, which we showed was false from our assumption
[08:37:57] <greenbagels> (sorry i mean if q divides p)
[08:38:18] <greenbagels> thus we have a contradiction and our assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational is false
[08:38:32] <lf94> you mean rational no?
[08:38:38] <greenbagels> yeah, sorry
[08:38:40] <lf94> ok ok

[08:39:32] <lf94> just _appears_ to be irrational
[08:39:49] <greenbagels> because irratioanl is typically defined to mean "not rational"
[08:40:05] <lf94> I guess the math numerical number scopes account for it

[08:42:55] <greenbagels> it also applies to the proof technique we used of proof by contradiction
[08:43:14] <greenbagels> in general i mean
[08:43:18] <mycroftiv> sometimes even if you dont disagree with it or disbelieve it, you dont want to use it because if you, you may not be able to compute a specific value that 'exists'

[08:44:22] <mycroftiv> imagine we only have a proof that its impossible for an irrational to not exist, but we dont know any specific number that is irrational. this kind of thing can happen due to LEM (of course not with irrationals though)
[08:44:27] <lf94> life is easier with excluded middle
[08:44:52] <greenbagels> but also irrational is kind of defined as "not rational", which makes contradiction kinda necessary here

[08:45:44] <lf94> and yeah it's crazy that's our proof for irrationals
[08:45:58] <mycroftiv> no we dont need LEM for irrationals
[08:46:06] <lf94> oh, nice
[08:46:22] <greenbagels> irrationality proofs are a category of proofs where a lot of people try to come up with elementary + unique proofs for fun
[08:46:27] <mycroftiv> just using negation or contradiction isnt the same as LEM
[08:47:16] <mycroftiv> even without LEM, it is still entirely valid for instance to disprove something by showing it leads to contradiction

[08:50:10] <mycroftiv> so as greenbagels was saying, irrational is -defined- as 'not rational' - and this is just a definition, its not implying or using LEM
[08:50:41] <greenbagels> i think i was saying both things, so maybe that caused confusion hehe
[08:51:27] <mycroftiv> and so then we look at sqrt of 2 and we say 'if it was rational, we could prove a contradiction, therefore it is not rational, and is thus irrational by definition'
[08:51:57] <mycroftiv> and so in the definition and proof of contradiction, at no point do we need to use LEM to produce 'A' from 'not-not-A'

[08:54:20] <greenbagels> (unless you're using double negations to prove things about the original prop)

[08:59:41] <mycroftiv> if you have a proof that some N exists and youve used a nonconstructive assumption, when you say 'now tell me what this N I have proved exists equals' you get back a lambda of the assumption -> N rather than an actual number
[09:00:50] <lf94> A implies B, not B. ← don't you have to declare A too as true or false to complete the statement
[09:01:15] <lf94> Wouldn't not B. just mean A can still be true or false
[09:01:47] <greenbagels> lf94: A implies B is only true if A and B are both true, or A is false
[09:02:00] <mycroftiv> lf94: if A implies B, and we find out B is false, we KNOW A must be false also. think carefully.

[09:04:35] <mycroftiv> thats correct statement due to material implication in classical logic, which is different than contrapositive, if im following correctly your notation
[09:04:42] <lf94> yeah yeah
[09:04:53] <lf94> ok ok, so it's a different type of logic
[09:07:06] <mycroftiv> im just trying to be clear about the names for things, not necessarily saying things were different, although some things do differ between classical and intuitionistic logic, but contrapositive is true for both
[09:09:18] <mycroftiv> its true even without LEM that if A implies B and B is false, A must be false also, as well as being true without LEM that you will never have both A and not-A true at the same time
[09:09:54] <mycroftiv> LEM is 'everything is either A or not-A' or 'we can go from not-not-A to A'
[09:11:03] <mycroftiv> but this is different than principle of explosion (false implies everything), contrapositive (a implies b, not b, therefore not a), and noncontradiction (not (A and Not-A both true))
[09:11:46] <mycroftiv> all of which you still have in intuitionistic/constructive logic. which means all of those logical principles dont prevent you from computing specific values if you use them

[14:40:19] <zibolo> Hello all, I'm struggling with a probability problem. Let's consider a game where I toss a dice for N times. For each time I got 4 consecutive six-face, I win a coin and "reset the counter" (that means that obtaining 5 consecutive six-face will not make me win two coins, but obtaining 8 consecutive will make me win two coins etc.). I'm trying to calculate the probability to win exactly X coins in a sequence of N tosses. Is there any known
[14:40:19] <zibolo>  problem or resource that you recommend me to lookup?
[14:41:06] <moon-child> zibolo: sounds a bit like a partitioning problem
[14:42:01] <moon-child> consider all the partitions of N each element of which does not exceed 4, and count how many have exactly X 4s
[14:42:27] <confuzius> also, sounds like something that can be easily simulated if you cannot find a trivial analytical answer

[14:55:43] <alphamule> It's interesting to note that a (2^n)-count cycle naturally falls within n bits of counting.  Sigh.  :/
[14:56:21] <riv> if there are N rolls, you need to count how many ways you can have blocks of 4 in there, and them multiply it 6 for each block and non-block - except this has an issue with this it overcounts
[14:56:27] <alphamule> Whih I guess was the point of the question

[14:56:58] <moon-child> 11112333345555 is like 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4.  That has three 4s in it, so that partition corresponds to a three
[14:57:04] <riv> it's BnnnnB block 4 nonblocks block
[14:57:15] <moon-child> 1111232324444 is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4
[14:57:18] <riv> so there are 6*6^4*6 possible ways to fill it in

[15:03:59] <riv> you count the ways of dividing a sequence of N rolls into X blocks N-4X nonblocks

[16:20:09] <riv> what's the definition this sum?
[16:21:09] <riv> note that {(x,y,0) in F^3} = {(x+y,y,0) in F^3}
[16:22:26] <flegia> It says that generally, the sum of n subspaces, U1,U2,...,Un is the set of all possible sums of their elements: U1+...+Un = {u1+...+un : u1 in U1, ... ,un in Un}
[16:22:42] <riv> ah okay
[16:23:02] <riv> so x,0,0 is a horizontal line, y,y,0 is a diagonal line
[16:23:15] <riv> their sum would be the 2d plane containing both those lines
