[03:33:01] <Hash> I am so lazy, in a goofy way, I'll buid a whole shelter but won't put up a tent.
[03:33:17] <Hash> Ugh Cuz then yo uhave to break it down and roll it back up and put it into bag and do the whole rods and everything
[03:33:26] <Hash> IT's just so much easier to just crap down and make a little shelter 
[03:33:48] <Hash> cut crap down*
[03:33:51] <SpookyGibby> cool, so anyway
[03:34:00] <Hash> You don't like camping?
[03:34:42] <baguettes> who wants to paly some dota2
[03:35:16] <Hash> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxFCpScuoCQ I love Matthew Posa's videos and his dog Monty is the most awesome!
[03:35:41] <Hash> So many camping channels I love this dude's only. Always roughing it out there, making sure his dog is first and always taken care of. 
[03:35:45] <Hash> Just peaceful and chil.

[03:36:20] <cryptic1> only a couple people the rest are ai bots
[03:36:32] <Hash> How new are you to IRC
[03:36:43] <baguettes> im 12
[03:36:44] <Hash> It's been this way since the late 1991 era
[03:36:52] <SpookyGibby> whew lad
[03:36:56] <Hash> You talk abotu whatever you want. 
[03:37:05] <xe0n> hey guys
[03:37:07] <xe0n> is it friday?
[03:37:07] <xe0n> :D
[03:37:10] <baguettes> i wasnt born in 1991
[03:37:14] <Hash> Whoever wants to talk, will. It used to be more chill. People weren't so hostile back then.
[03:37:17] <baguettes> what was it like back then
[03:37:21] <SpookyGibby> This has RAT vibes 
[03:37:24] <Hash> Mostly nerds

[03:37:42] <Hash> Mostly university staff/faculty
[03:37:55] <baguettes> did you have to like, mail in your message through a telegram to have someone at the main IRC HQ put it on here for you
[03:37:57] <Hash> Now it's every single troll and their cousin thinking their opinion matters pretending to be cool.
[03:38:10] <baguettes> kinda like people thinking their opinion on camping matters amirite
[03:38:10] <Hash> IRC did change, but because people lately became too mental. Culture is a hell of a drug.
[03:38:20] <SpookyGibby> uh huh
[03:39:02] <baguettes> im only on IRC for the gibbyfarts updates
[03:39:20] <Hash> Everyone opinions matter to them and whomever else deems it worthy enough. To hassle each other and be a dick about it, that started in the 90s and in the sitcoms. It became somehow cool to be a douche to your peers. Somehow that's how 'funny' evolved into. Sad.
[03:39:37] <baguettes> Sad
[03:39:40] <Hash> It used to intelligence, articulation, compassion, treating people kindly, that used to be cool.
[03:39:42] <Hash> :)
[03:39:44] <baguettes> Sad
[03:39:45] <baguettes> :(
[03:39:50] <Hash> </3
[03:39:55] <Disconsented> self awareness is overrated
[03:40:09] <baguettes> You know what else used to be cool? Feudalism but it's not anymore because people smartened up
[03:40:22] <Hash> There is no self. One can only become aware of what one already knows.
[03:40:36] <Hash> the 'self' is the greatest BS peddled to mankind by culture/society.
[03:41:34] <Hash> It's just the law of the jungle that matters. If you're cool to other apes on the planet, they'll mostly be cool to you.
[03:41:44] <Hash> Call it a golden rule, I dunno. 
[03:41:52] <Hash> silver, platinum, whatever floats your boat.

[03:42:50] <killdash9> Hash: I can ensure there's no you here if you like
[03:43:05] <baguettes> because you are typing like jigsaw
[03:43:08] <Hash> killdash9: oh I mean like in a philosophical sense
[03:43:19] <Hash> baguettes: adhd. I think fast and too much.
[03:43:25] <Hash> It's exhausting.
[03:43:35] <baguettes> thinking doesn't require you to put hands on keyboards and exhaust the rest of us
[03:43:40] <killdash9> ^^^^^
[03:44:01] <Hash> So you're hating on someone for 'chatting' too much on Internet Relay Chat.
[03:44:04] <Hash> Alright. Peace.
[03:44:08] <baguettes> k bye

[03:45:53] <mistiry> but i thought 'self' didnt exist
[03:45:58] <baguettes> Confuscious says man with 4 balls cannot walk
[03:46:11] <cryptic1> he can walk
[03:46:13] <mistiry> Confuscious says man who stand on toilet high on pot
[03:46:16] <cryptic1> just very very carefully
[03:46:29] <baguettes> Confuscious say man with glass walls should not walk around naked
[03:46:36] <xe0n> confusing man with 4 balls cannot walk
[03:46:38] <xe0n> err wait
[03:47:53] <Hash> If the day ever came that I ever hassled another innocent man in the world for chatting on internet relay chat, I hope to be punched square in the face to bring me back to reality.

[03:55:15] <Church> Heh
[03:55:29] <Church> xe0n: So got this new hard cider. It's... interesting
[03:55:40] <Church> After taste is usually booze and apples yeah?
[03:55:52] <baguettes> and basic bitch dont forget that
[03:55:59] <Church> On this one the foretaste is apple and the aftertaste is booze and hard spices.
[03:56:08] <Church> I'm... not sure if I like this
[03:56:19] <Church> I do have a can of boozed hibiscus tea to try though.
[04:01:23] <SpookyGibby> who wants to do the fortnite dance with me?

[09:35:57] <zerocool> to me it looks like things that i would think to myself, but it's posted publicly with no context

[09:36:31] <zerocool> im actually looking at mastodon, and misskey
[09:36:35] <zerocool> so, like, no ads. 
[09:37:06] <catbeard> well js that you don't have to see other platform's ads
[09:37:07] <zerocool> some of the posts have useful info but it's like 1% of what i've seen
[09:37:31] <catbeard> but you _could_ put your own ads if you wanted
[09:37:44] <catbeard> i like to tie the ad loading to the login routes
[09:37:55] <catbeard> that way unless you're logged in you can't block the ads ;)

[09:39:45] <bloody> depends on the content
[09:39:55] <bloody> ublock blocks all yt ads
[09:40:03] <catbeard> depends on the CTR and keywords you rank for
[09:40:16] <catbeard> i've seen sites that pay 100x what the hosting costs just from ads alone
[09:40:18] <sd> 13<C​olour> Smart TVs and Xbox don't have all the adblock
[09:40:23] <bloody> finance content on youtube pays the most I think

[09:40:30] <zerocool> no ads
[09:40:37] <zerocool> except nordvpn and shit
[09:40:44] <bloody> in that case I think you'll need a pihole colour but yeah agreed, ads on a TV make 0 sense
[09:41:10] <catbeard> i've seen smart tvs that use their own dns servers bypassing the pihole/unbound
[09:41:17] <catbeard> so i dstnat that hoe
[09:41:23] <zerocool> i feel like ads are attention std's
[09:41:25] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah and then you need DHCP to give it pihole DNS or have my Windows servers point to pihole
[09:41:30] <zerocool> you're there for the content but you get ads
[09:42:02] <bloody> the smart tv i have only has an ad tile on the app selection menu 
[09:42:04] <bloody> but still

[09:47:28] <JollyRgrs> my only complaints will be for things i pay for and still get ads (like some twitch stuff even though i've got twitch prime)

[09:47:47] <JollyRgrs> was prob the best music streaming service i've used
[09:47:56] <zerocool> i've been "okay" with yt music.
[09:48:00] <bloody> yep twitch prime used to be ad free
[09:48:05] <bloody> nope they took that off too now
[09:48:08] <JollyRgrs> moved to spotify mostly b/c my daughter was using it a lot and might as well bring the family plan over to it... it was better than YT Music
[09:48:39] <JollyRgrs> bloody: yup :( I wouldn't be upset about it if all that revenue went to the streamers AND THE STREAMERS HAD AN OPTION TO TURN IT OFF!
[09:48:48] <zerocool> i just signed up for spotify today bc of joe rogan
[09:49:04] <JollyRgrs> you have an option to add MORE ads, but there's a bare min. that I think twitch adds in no matter what unless you are a subscriber
[09:49:09] <SpookyGibby> Yikes
[09:49:09] <bloody> thankfully theres a twitch adblock that has been working for a couple months with no issues
[09:49:10] <JollyRgrs> b/c of joe?
[09:49:18] <JollyRgrs> why would you do ANYTHING b/c of joe rogan?
[09:49:20] <bloody> you need twitch turbo
[09:49:30] <bloody> for ad free twitch
[09:49:41] <JollyRgrs> i like doing twitch on my chromecast w/ google tv tho
[09:49:49] <bloody> ah yeah
[09:50:00] <JollyRgrs> btw... i love it... but still kinda pissed
[09:50:01] <SpookyGibby> I don't get the appeal of Joe Rogan, but to each their own
[09:50:03] <zerocool> i use to watch on yt, he left, i didn't follow. recently curious what he's been up to
[09:50:21] <JollyRgrs> can't get great stability on wifi (could be nearby airport)... so i gotta get a usb-c hub with ethernet...
[09:50:31] <zerocool> i like his guests and tbh he's a good interviewer
[09:50:41] <JollyRgrs> and then it only has 4GB internal memory... and ~3gb of that is OS and std apps
[09:50:55] <SpookyGibby> I say that as an avid Stern listener
[09:51:17] <zerocool> SpookyGibby: to each their own :)
[09:51:24] <JollyRgrs> i thought you meant you switched to spotify b/c rogan suggested his listeners should, lol
[09:51:29] <SpookyGibby> Indeed
[09:51:39] <bloody> yeah same
[09:51:46] <bloody> doesnt he post his podcasts on youtube
[09:51:46] <JollyRgrs> i'm same boat as gibby... he ain't my cuppa tea, but you do you
[09:52:09] <zerocool> only parts of his podcasts end up on youtube
[09:52:19] <zerocool> afaik
[09:52:38] <SpookyGibby> I have some *actual* reasons why I think the way I do, but they're not appropriate for here
[09:53:15] <JollyRgrs> SpookyGibby: it's ok, we all know you'd prob turn gay for joe rogan if you listened to him

[19:13:08] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Kinda sorta, in the same vein - basically
[19:13:23] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> when the trigger resets, it's designed to push your finger off the trigger. And then, if you're pulling with the right amount of force

[19:13:43] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Such force already exists in normal triggers, but not enough to actually push your finger off the trigger.
[19:14:24] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> It seems like this was actually created as a honeypot for the government though, @Rika - the design was created by a lawyer in this field.
