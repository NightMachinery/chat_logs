[21:45:23] <Delf> If Russia were to invade my country and I know I have no chance of defending my people... and resistance would result in too much collateral damage for my people, I would give up. The only condition where I would want my people to actually DiE is if I'm 100% certain that them being alive under the conditions of some other leader would be worse than death.
[21:46:38] <Delf> I'd actually commit suicide and take over my enemy's body and fuck myself over, in such extreme conditions. But I do understand that this is not an option for most people
[21:46:56] <xx> Delf: I can't explain why genocide is a bad thing because I generally don't hold all that much feeling about genocide.
[21:47:11] <xx> google should probably have some resources for you
[21:47:30] <xx> e.g. I fully support genocide of malaria-bearing mosquito species
[21:47:41] <xx> or genocide of tick-borne encephalitis bearing ticks
[21:47:48] <xx> or coronavirus-bearing bats
[21:47:54] <xx> or ...
[21:48:06] <Delf> If genocide is the only option, sure. But it's best to exhaust other options first
[21:48:15] <xx> I prefer quick and easy
[21:48:39] <Delf> Easy is not always right

[21:49:08] <xx> s/by/with/
[21:49:08] <ro-bot-o> xx meant to say: I don't really concern myself with 'what is right?' all that much
[21:49:38] <Delf> xx: This is why I'm curious about why human genocide would be a bad thing, according to you

[23:02:33] <Rashad> why?
[23:02:46] <Blankspace> People tell me I am anti-social
[23:03:03] <ProfSimm> Delf: you're aggressively explaining why you're not aggressive.
[23:03:10] <Delf> People usually don't understand me so they pick the next best closest thing
[23:03:11] <Blankspace> Because I don't have any friends and I don't talk to anyone
[23:03:17] <ProfSimm> Delf: I just came in, but I find that interesting
[23:03:36] <Delf> Except the next best closest thing is not really close to me at all!
[23:05:12] <Delf> ProfSimm: I'm under heavy fire mate. Some heavy artillery of accusations are shot my direction. I must defend my character!
[23:05:34] <Delf> Lest my honor will be shattered like glas in shits
[23:05:50] <arryana> you're endlessly under the delusion that you can tell people who you think you are.  other people will decide for themselves on the basis of your words and behavior.
[23:06:00] <arryana> and those things paint a very different picture of you than you claim.
[23:06:38] <Delf> It's different from one person to another. One person will try to kill me while another will try to sacrifice themselves for me

[23:06:51] <ProfSimm> Delf: well, I honor you
[23:07:12] <arryana> i very much doubt there's many of either.  i suspect most people just think you're full of hot air.
[23:07:32] <Delf> No, most people don't know where to put me so they avoid me
[23:07:57] <Delf> ProfSimm: How?
[23:08:01] <Blankspace> Sacrifice life for me . There are few
[23:08:12] <ProfSimm> Delf: I don't know yet, but I feel like it.
[23:08:28] <Delf> Why?
[23:09:05] <Delf> I must explain to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for me... to NOT ever do any such thing because when they die they don't come back, unlike me so it would be a terrible waste and mistake
[23:09:24] <ProfSimm> Delf: this channel is a social unit. We're here because of shared interests. No one should feel attacked I think. We all share something if we're here.
[23:09:53] <Delf> Nice nice...
[23:10:33] <Delf> As for aggressive, insults are best served physically hence I avoid insulting verbally
[23:10:46] <Rashad> Yeah I feel so respected now.
[23:11:04] * ProfSimm respects everyone here so hard right now
[23:11:12] <Delf> Why, Rashad?
[23:11:57] <Delf> We could shake hands and introduce ourselves. If you don't mind, we could hug too, Rashad
[23:12:42] <Rashad> Delf I am sorry I said you have ASPD
[23:12:53] <Delf> No need to be sorry
[23:13:07] <Delf> What is ASPD? A compliment?
[23:13:23] <Rashad> ASPD is Anti-Social Personality Disorder
[23:13:40] <Delf> Ahhh... I have Multiple personality ORDER. I'm not anti-social :D

[23:27:12] <Delf> They don't want to be in my heart? Its such a harsh place to be in?
[23:28:27] <Delf> Here we go again with the heavy artillery
[23:30:55] <arryana> if your aim is to be creepy, that'd be a good way to go about it.
[23:31:19] <Delf> I don't want people to be afraid of me
[23:32:02] <Delf> I can show them that but I cannot pretend to be something I'm not either, it is insulting to my integrity and it would be dishonest to them
[23:36:05] <Delf> It doesn't really take that much time to notice that somethings.. "not right with" or "very different with" me
[23:36:52] <Delf> And which of those is totally dependant on others, not me

[23:53:23] <arryana> you're not making any sense.
[23:53:46] <Delf> That is usually the case, isn't it
[23:54:00] <Delf> Lost count of how many times you've mentioned it
[23:54:25] * Delf was actually counting but stopped at some point
[23:55:07] <arryana> here's the thing.  you can't tell me to /ignore you.  you can, however, /ignore me if that's what you choose to do.
[23:56:14] <Delf> No no... YOU can't tell me what I can't tell you. Actually... I can't tell you what you can't tell me what I can't tell you. So, you can tell me whatever, and I can tell you whatever
[23:57:43] <arryana> good lord, you have a lot of growing up to do.
[23:58:44] <Delf> I seem to be bothering you and I don't want to do that. You're constantly calling me on my bullshit and this, I cannot have this. It direct attack to my character, I can't take it. I don't want people to know that I'm an assholes and you keep letting them know
