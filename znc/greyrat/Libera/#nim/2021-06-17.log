[01:01:23] <dom96> holy crap what a maze
[01:01:37] <oprypin> dom96, so you found the Gitter room on Matrix
[01:02:00] <oprypin> are you still looking for the IRC channel on Matrix? and why?
[01:02:12] <dom96> some people want us to bridge matrix directly to discord
[01:02:19] <dom96> and I'm trying to figure out how feasible that is
[01:02:23] <leorize[m]> this room is #nim:libera.chat btw
[01:03:07] <dom96> wouldn't it be good to have #nim-lang:matrix.org etc?
[01:03:22] <oprypin> dom96, then you'll have 3 rooms on Matrix
[01:03:29] <dom96> I mean, it looks like it already exists but is bridged to gitter
[01:03:29] <leorize[m]> if you want to visit science, it's #nim-science:envs.net for the discord <> matrix

[01:04:11] <leorize[m]> we can't use the gitter room directly since matrix admin doesn't work on gitter server

[01:04:21] <rainbowasteroids> test
[01:04:21] <dom96> *gitter
[01:04:23] <oprypin> dom96, the existing Matrix rooms are https://app.element.io/#/room/#nim-lang_Nim:gitter.im  and  https://app.element.io/#/room/#nim:libera.chat  
[01:04:39] <oprypin> dom96, every Gitter room is accessible on Matrix via that scheme, it's not optional
[01:04:42] <rainbowasteroids> are these rooms link to discord?
[01:05:14] <leorize[m]> we can ask gitter support to bridge those room to a room of our choice
[01:05:22] <dom96> so https://gitter.im/nim-lang/Nim is automatically linked to #nim-lang:matrix.org?
[01:05:32] <leorize[m]> <dom96 "so https://gitter.im/nim-lang/Ni"> no
[01:05:44] <oprypin> wait, sorry.. i have no clue about #nim-lang:matrix.org . was talking about gitter
[01:06:02] <dom96> okay, that makes more sense :)
[01:07:03] <oprypin> and regarding Matrix users who are currently in this room: I have no idea why you're accessing this room through IRC if you could be accessing it through Gitter for a much wider feature set
[01:07:12] <dom96> but still leaves the question, why is #nim-lang:matrix.org bridged to gitter
[01:08:05] <oprypin> that is indeed a big question and i'd be *very* interested in finding that out
[01:08:10] <dom96> leorize[m], any ideas?
[01:08:23] <dom96> also why is #nim-science on envs.net?

[01:13:08] <leorize[m]> they probably asked for a manual bridge
[01:14:15] <leorize[m]> or it was bridged a long time ago when gitter wasn't a part of matrix
[01:14:24] <leorize[m]> then when they merge they keep the bridge
[01:19:14] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> so what's the advantage of envs over matrix.org?
[01:19:43] <leorize[m]> it's not matrix.org
[01:20:02] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> right...?
[01:20:15] <leorize[m]> matrix is a decentralized protocol, so you should avoid centralizing in matrix.org, that's all
[01:20:47] <leorize[m]> and rooms are not controlled by the servers if you're wondering
[01:21:23] <leorize[m]> the server only serve as a namespace. my account is in envs.net, so when I created the room, it carries envs.net in it's name
[01:21:51] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> okay, well I created a bunch of nim-* channels on matrix.org. As long as there is no big disadvantage to hosting these here I think we can use these.
[01:22:16] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> actually one advantage I can see is that matrix.org channels appear to be much easier to find
[01:22:24] <FromGitter> <dom96:matrix.org> searching for science I couldn't find the envs.net channel
