[04:49:22] <ButterNoodle> and u manage it with a web gui

[04:53:02] <ButterNoodle> KVM and vmware are type 1 hypervisors

[07:15:16] <amigojapan> Ok back, that was a long leave
[07:16:05] <MootPoot> damn
[07:16:09] <MootPoot> this thing is way faster then the pi
[07:16:23] <MootPoot> well, it also eats like 3x the power
[07:16:27] <MootPoot> but lets forget about that
[07:17:23] <MootPoot> seems like it comes with ubuntu out of the box
[07:17:25] <amigojapan> Nice MootPoot 
[07:18:19] <MootPoot> doing the usual 
[07:18:21] <amigojapan> I have nothing against Intel atom
[07:18:58] <MootPoot> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt get upgrade right now
[07:19:10] <MootPoot> amigojapan: well its not open source is it
[07:19:21] <MootPoot> that being said neither is the Raspberry pi I guess
[07:19:29] <amigojapan> Right
[07:19:41] <MootPoot> is there any completely open source SBC
[07:20:23] <amigojapan> The chip was supposed to be, but I don't think that ever took off
[07:20:28] <MootPoot> every one I know at least has a closed source cpu
[07:20:33] <MootPoot> like the allwinner series boards
[07:20:59] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  I know there is RISC-V but according to aurora that isen't really open source or something like that
[07:21:07] <MootPoot> I know there are a few RISC-V boards
[07:21:30] <MootPoot> there is IBM OPENPOWER but its not in anything even similar to a SBC that normies can buy
[07:26:05] <MootPoot> amigojapan: its really rather convinent ordering around 3 linux computers from my windows main box
[07:26:09] <MootPoot> using SSH
[07:26:52] <amigojapan> It's that supposed to make me angry?
[07:26:57] <MootPoot> ?
[07:27:01] <MootPoot> no its just convinent
[07:27:18] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:27:34] <MootPoot> is there any clients like mobaXterm on linux
[07:27:40] <MootPoot> where you can do the same thing
[07:27:54] <MootPoot> from one app you can SSH and VNC into as many other systems as you want
[07:29:00] <MootPoot> I see there is an app called Terminator for linux but it only does SSH not VNC as well
[07:30:31] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems like this SBC actually runs   ubuntu decently fast 
[07:30:39] <MootPoot> it might be viable as a main computer
[07:31:15] <MootPoot> only problem is that it only has one usb 3.0 port so I guess you need a hub so you can plug in a keyboard, mouse and maybe an external drive too
[07:31:29] <amigojapan> Nice MootPoot 
[07:31:45] <MootPoot> although it does seem to actually use all the power 
[07:31:53] <MootPoot> that giant heatsink does get noticably warm
[07:32:29] <amigojapan> Did you the running a YouTube video in browser?
[07:32:36] <MootPoot> yeah
[07:32:44] <MootPoot> it has a hardware decoder so that works fine
[07:33:06] <MootPoot> it still lags if you open more then 3-4 tabs though

[07:48:02] <MootPoot> Hmm
[07:48:11] <MootPoot> Okay

[15:07:58] <darkwitch> DunceCotus, wait, what?
[15:08:49] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I suspect DunceCotus is taking us into conspiracy time
[15:09:16] <darkwitch> his world is different from ours
[15:10:49] <darkwitch> I'm hungry
[15:10:50] <DunceCotus> 45,000 years ago, in 2012..
[15:11:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I don't think even a trip into space would convince DunceCotus he is wrong
[15:12:23] <darkwitch> he's not wrong. it's another world, like in isekai
[15:12:44] <DunceCotus> a trip into space.. yeah right
[15:12:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and you probably think airplanes take you overseas
[15:13:22] <amigojapan> Yup DunceCotus I have experienced that many times
[15:14:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: illusions deceive
[15:14:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so what does an airplane actually do?

[15:15:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its like one of those VR rides they had in shopping malls
[15:15:22] <amigojapan> Yeah, reality is indeed weird, even Withought making stuff up
[15:15:23] <DunceCotus> basically the stage changes around the plane
[15:15:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is in-line with quantum physics 
[15:16:03] <DunceCotus> though maybe only barely
[15:16:17] <amigojapan> darkwitch: kaonashi ninja?
[15:16:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you know those VR rides which was like a capsule that held like 6 people inside
[15:16:48] <amigojapan> That's nuts DunceCotus 
[15:16:49] <DunceCotus> and it was on a pneumatic arm
[15:17:09] <Sadale> nya~ :3

[15:17:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it is nuts! 
[15:17:27] <darkwitch> ninja ryoujin
[15:17:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, woah. Talk about safety. The way that you power the atomic pi
[15:17:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but reality is built up by these artifices
[15:17:39] <DunceCotus> these productions of production
[15:18:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, make sure that the dupoint cables are secure. If the +ve and the ground shorts, bad thing happens.
[15:18:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I dunno if its a conspiracy more an ontological crick
[15:18:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's nobody deliberately setting out to fool people into thinking planes really take them overseas
[15:18:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but somehow.. that's what happens?

[15:20:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: how do you explain the changes when I got to Japan by plane and back to Mexico?
[15:20:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it doesn't matter if its faked, it still works, we are literally moved
[15:20:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the world morphed is all i'll say
[15:20:53] <DunceCotus> its getting into 4 (spatial) D territory
[15:21:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: space and time is a 4D object perhaps
[15:21:51] <amigojapan> It is
[15:21:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and facets of this 4D object slicing into 3D is what produces our world
[15:22:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we have a certain unconscious control of the 4D object as we are refractions of it
[15:23:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is why you should continue watching Sonny Boy
[15:23:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: when I walk, does that actually change my location or is that an illusion too?

[15:26:40] <darkwitch> om nom
[15:26:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: possibly certain energies
[15:26:51] <DunceCotus> energies are required for any illusion to get off 'ground'
[15:27:03] <darkwitch> oh dear, it's written ryourinin
[15:27:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't think you can have it both ways. Either this is just a simulation or the world is flat
[15:27:52] <amigojapan> Oh I see darkwitch 
[15:27:53] <DunceCotus> well that's why its flat
[15:28:16] <DunceCotus> but its not a simulation in the sense of well there's some 'higher reality', even if there is more 'real' realities
[15:28:16] <darkwitch> ryoujin is husband, which is also good
[15:28:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you mean the simulated world is flat?

[21:52:28] <ButterNoodle> is it all big agribusiness?
[21:52:43] <ButterNoodle> big ag or small niche farming
[21:52:46] <emmeka> no, mostly small family farms, though in Canada a small farm is 2000 acres.
[21:52:49] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: the farmers here sell me cabbages for disposable onahole use
[21:53:02] * ButterNoodle starts planting cabbage
[21:53:13] <Jigsy> Just use a Cabbage Patch doll.
[21:53:24] <emmeka> ButterNoodle so various sectors here have total supply management, or farmer-run single desk systems
[21:53:28] <ButterNoodle> yea I would consider 2k acres the average farm size here
[21:54:11] <emmeka> basically farmers control supply to match demand with quota systems in some industries, and in others there's a single body that sells to buyers on behalf of sellers.
[21:54:16] <ButterNoodle> I see so probably some kinda production control and logistics for those that want to be a part of it and survive
[21:54:17] * MootPoot realises that emmeka is actually the MC of gin no saji
[21:54:21] <emmeka> until very recently the entire grain trade works this way
[21:54:58] <emmeka> ButterNoodle the quota system is pretty great because it keeps farms stable without costing us any tax dollars, but it'd never fly in the US because it's basically socialism
[21:55:14] <emmeka> instead you just throw cash subsidies at a free market which doesn't work

[21:55:57] <DPA> zoidberg: Yes, plants and animal cells are very different. But they aren't completely incompatible either. You can, for example, put spider silk genes into yeast, and stuff like that, and it'll produce the right proteins.
[21:55:57] <DPA> In the end, there only need to be the right proteines & cell structures replicated, I think. Still orders of magnitudes harder, than the kinds of things currently done, but I don't think it's impossible.

[21:56:19] <emmeka> the active quota systems in the country right now are dairy, eggs, chicken, and turkey.
[21:56:28] <ButterNoodle> its was localized and probably very effective
[21:56:30] <emmeka> as well as maple syrup in Qu√©bec, I guess.
[21:56:43] <emmeka> MootPoot theoretically yes, but that's not really how it works
[21:56:46] <MootPoot> cuebeek
[21:57:06] <ButterNoodle> I do miss farm life.. just not the hard fucking labor..
[21:57:20] <ButterNoodle> and I dont have enough kids to run a farm

[21:57:43] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yes... lookup "stable girl" on exhentai
[21:57:56] <emmeka> MootPoot in practice, dairy farms that overproduce above their quota slightly just basically end up giving the milk away to the dairy board
[21:58:26] <emmeka> which then directs it into long term storage markets that are structured to buy up this overflow, like powdered milk
[21:58:36] <ButterNoodle> maybe my next wife will have some kids I can use for child labor on a farm

[21:59:17] <emmeka> MootPoot in theory if a farmer produced way, way WAY above their quota they would have no choice but to dump, but nobody is stupid enough to do this
[21:59:26] <emmeka> it's actually in the USA where dumping milk happens a lot

[22:00:20] <emmeka> because there, supply and demand work according to a free market. When demand for milk from processors declines, farms can't just shut off the taps on the cow and downsize. They're usually caught offguard, and have to dump

[22:05:34] <MootPoot> we get american milk?
[22:05:40] <emmeka> since USMCA, yes
[22:05:42] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: when you put it like that it sounds like a co op monopoly
[22:06:49] <emmeka> MootPoot a consequence of Trump's revision of NAFTA was that we opened a slice of our dairy market to the Americans, without them reciprocating. Basically, we let them dump subsidized market excess due to their stupid system constantly resulting in oversupply.
[22:07:10] <MootPoot> the only milk I ever see is that Beatrice brand - which after some googling its actually from ontario
[22:07:18] <emmeka> MootPoot so, always look out for that little Dairy farmers of Canada logo. It's blue.
[22:07:29] <MootPoot> although whoever thought up the name "beatrice" should be fired
[22:07:37] <ButterNoodle> that sounds kawaii

[22:09:46] <MootPoot> so much riskier to transport

[22:10:24] <zoidberg> Lol
[22:10:25] <emmeka> idk why other places don't have bagged milk, it's so much nicer. You only open 1L at a time as you need it
[22:10:27] <MootPoot> Why can't we just go back to like glass bottles that get refilled
[22:10:51] <ButterNoodle> how about 1/2L sacks
[22:11:02] <zoidberg> I get like 500ml daily. It‚Äôs enough for me and my parents.
[22:11:02] <ButterNoodle> thats seems to be all the milk we drink around here

[22:11:24] <MootPoot> or real
[22:11:40] <Bco1981> it's not real milk

[22:11:47] <MootPoot> it says real milk tho
[22:11:53] <emmeka> oh, it's just UHT pasteurized. yes, it's real.
[22:11:55] <Bco1981> there is more in it
[22:12:07] <emmeka> MootPoot to clarify, it's only shelf-stable when you haven't opened it.
[22:12:13] <emmeka> once you've opened it, it's normal milk.

[22:12:20] <Bco1981> i don't like the taste of pasteurized milk.

[22:14:59] <Bco1981> zoidberg: i might be wrong, might be that it's not homogenized then. it is more close to the real thing.
[22:15:31] <emmeka> in some places you can buy raw whole milk.
[22:15:38] <emmeka> that is not homogenized.
[22:15:43] <MootPoot> emmeka: did you click
[22:15:45] <MootPoot> on the pic
[22:15:48] <emmeka> yeah.
[22:16:01] <MootPoot> I can't get over a grocery store holding a high end figuirne
[22:16:05] <zoidberg> emmeka: so what makes organic milk?
[22:16:07] <MootPoot> for some reason
[22:16:17] <emmeka> zoidberg that it came from a certified organic farm.
[22:16:21] <emmeka> that's about it.
[22:16:54] <zoidberg> does that mean there's nothing done to that milk?
[22:17:00] <Bco1981> zoidberg: "no use of fertilizers or pesticides"
[22:17:31] <emmeka> my agricultural college had a certified organic experimental dairy farm, and I'm not sure it's worth the price. the fundamental difference is that the cows have garaunteed access to pasture, are fed organic feeds, and can receive very few antibiotics
[22:17:44] <emmeka> Bco1981 well ofc they use fertilizers, just organic ones.
[22:17:46] <zoidberg> I see.
[22:17:49] <emmeka> which means basically nothing.
[22:18:03] <Bco1981> the taste is much better
[22:18:22] <Bco1981> going back to a milk that has those. taste like chemicals
[22:18:25] <Bco1981> not milk
[22:18:31] <zoidberg> emmeka: but is it really better in taste or health wise? is it worth the money?
[22:18:40] <emmeka> rock phosphate = certified organic, since it's a natural mineral or whatever. but process that into superphosphate which regular farmers would use, and it's banned in organic agriculture.
[22:18:53] <emmeka> zoidberg imo, as someone heavily embedded in organic ag, no.
[22:19:14] <zoidberg> emmeka: taste too?
[22:19:26] * MootPoot imagines echidana milk
[22:19:53] <emmeka> I mean don't get me wrong I think there's a lot of value in many organic practices, ecologically and culturally, but anyone who tells you that it needs that certified organic seal on it to be good for you and be quality, is lying.

[22:42:07] <zoidberg> Bco1981: honestly, someday when you have time, share recipe with me
[22:42:14] <MootPoot> zoidberg: oh really?
[22:42:23] <Berlin36> should've been a nice lasagna
[22:42:40] <MootPoot> I heard that like 60% of india is vegetarian so your I thought you must not have that much supply either since the demand is not there
[22:42:56] <Berlin36> big numbers right there
[22:43:08] <zoidberg> yeah MootPoot, people eat meat here. A lot of meat just like everywhere else but they just don't eat beef.
[22:43:53] <zoidberg> MootPoot: I don't know about percentages but there are significant number of people who don't eat meat. True.
[22:44:12] <zoidberg> MootPoot: I come from one of those families.
[22:44:34] <Berlin36> today i watched a video of a guy planting like 10 pieces of rice
[22:45:03] <Berlin36> duude, it took him a few months only to get like 100grams of rice from 4 plants
[22:45:35] <Berlin36> a long process it is, and i never knew rice is grown like that lmao, never actually thought about that
[22:45:42] <zoidberg> even if he plants single rice, it takes the same time
[22:45:50] <Berlin36> yeah 
[22:46:11] <zoidberg> Berlin36: yeah,  different crops have different times and also depended on seasons
