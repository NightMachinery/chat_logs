[07:41:40] <Ara> A full node is a piece of software that speaks a protocol to other pees that speak the same protocol. You tell your node you own a series of keypairs corresponding to addresses, and if it sees a tx to or from those addresses, it updates a running total of the btc controlled by those addresses. Like any other piece of software, it can do any arbitrary thing when it sees a tx, such as check and update a database of pending payments from customers
[07:42:31] <Ara> You can modify a node to do this directly, or interact with a node through some api like the remote procedure calls exposed by bitcoin core, to do the same thing in a different software layer

[22:19:00] <s17> for the private key dump, you probalby have to unlockwallet before you do that, (if it's locked)
[22:19:25] <bitblit> rescanning now.. also i was able to dump the priv keys, my console window was set to the wrong wallet when i originally ran the command. importing those keys to electrum didn't seem to have any effect.

[22:50:04] <Guest59> hello, can somebody help me with verifying SHA256SUMS of the latest release?
[22:51:57] <Guest59> $ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
[22:51:57] <Guest59> gpg: assuming signed data in 'SHA256SUMS'
[22:51:58] <Guest59> gpg: Signature made ....
[22:51:58] <Guest59> gpg:                using RSA key 0CCBAAFD76A2ECE2CCD3141DE2FFD5B1D88CA97D
[22:51:59] <Guest59> gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
[22:51:59] <Guest59> ... and there are only "Can't check signature: No public key" messages.
[22:52:40] <Guest59> not one OK message, that should be there for imported Wladimir J. van der Laan key
[22:53:50] <Ara> Have you tried going to a search engine and typing something like "gpg Can't check signature: No public key"?
[22:53:55] <Ara> Or did you come straight here?
[22:53:57] <Guest59> I did
[22:54:03] <Ara> And what did it say?
[22:54:05] <Guest59> I have Wladimir J. van der Laan key imported
[22:54:21] <Ara> There are 12 other keys besides the one you have
[22:54:50] <Guest59> yes, where I should get them? https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ mentiones only his key

[22:55:49] <Ara> Probably from a keyserver, or better yet, directly from those other 12 signers (dm, or personal website, etc)
[22:56:10] <Ara> The more sources you use to confirm those keys actually belong to the right people, the better
[22:56:57] <paulo> i just clone the bitocin source code from github
[22:57:08] <paulo> are there any "wishlist" of features I could work on?
[22:57:10] <Guest59> well then, download page should be updated then. since the key mentioned there is not present in the latest SHA256SUMS.asc signature list
[22:58:44] <Guest59> oh, I'm not the first one https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/issues/793
