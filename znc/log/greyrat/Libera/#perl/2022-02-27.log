[19:56:57] <millican> is this where one should ask questions on perl configuration?

[19:58:10] <leont> What do you mean with perl configuration? You're compiling perl?
[19:58:48] <millican> system commands are using /bin/sh, i want to set it to /bin/bash
[19:59:09] <millican> I hope I don't have to compile
[19:59:21] <leont> That doesn't have anything to do with perl
[20:02:02] <lopid> call bash yourself
[20:05:25] <millican> I'd prefer to. That's what I'm looking for help with. calling the iptables command in a perl script results in command not found as it's looking in /bin/sh, not /bin/bash
[20:05:58] <simcop2387> that's a $ENV{PATH} issue not a shell issue.
[20:09:58] <hurl> call the command with the full path

[20:32:17] <simcop2387> millican: you can also however do, system("/bin/bash", "-c", "iptables ...") too, but generally you want to avoid relying on the shell when doing this as it can very easily lead to security problems.  most common one is someone sticks a fake iptables in your $PATH environment variable or something similar
[20:33:19] <simcop2387> ah i see aquanight mentioned the {} part calling bash explicitly.  but it's still better to specify exactly which iptables command you want and not rely on things like bash in the end.  that's how you end up with things like shellshock

[21:32:48] <Grinnz> no, much more different
[21:33:24] <Grinnz> you could look at raku code and think it looks perl-ish, but even basic syntax is different

[21:34:01] <Grinnz> it's more similar to perl than ruby, but not by much
[21:34:37] <millican> I hadn't even heard of this. weird stuff.
[21:34:46] <qq_78> so, if I wanted to learn Perl with all the powerful Regex, one liners and text processing capabilities, I should learn Perl 5 or 6? And this chatroom is Perl 5 or Perl 6?
[21:34:53] <Grinnz> anyway yeah the situation with perl 6 and 7 are both pretty fucked up but there's a lot of history that led to all that
[21:35:12] <Grinnz> perl 5 is perl, this channel is for perl
[21:35:13] *** Joins: Su-Shee (~Susanne@p4ffc7326.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[21:35:23] <Grinnz> perl 6 is raku, #raku is for that
[21:35:37] <Grinnz> both have those capabilities, but perl 5 is the one you're talking about
[21:36:26] <millican> just checked debian's repository. 
[21:36:37] <millican> perl 5 is named "perl"
[21:36:45] <millican> Raku compiler is "perl6"
[21:36:57] <Grinnz> that should have gotten renamed to raku by now :/

[21:37:23] <millican> i was just wondering if it were something i could install by mistake and then wonder why my scripts don't work
[21:37:35] <Grinnz> no, it won't conflict with any perl binaries
[21:37:43] <millican> that's good
[21:38:46] <qq_78> which one do you suggest I learn, Perl 5 or Perl 6? I don't need to read legacy code. And piping into grep/awk isn't cutting it no more.
[21:39:19] <Grinnz> learn whatever languages you want, but i am biased to perl of course
[21:39:53] <Grinnz> raku's strengths are largely parallelism/threading and complex grammars (though those have not great performance so far)
[21:39:58] <qq_78> Grinnz, I thought Perl was interpereted language. What do you mean binaries?
[21:40:06] <krismatrix> I am having an interesting problem. In my prod (remote server), when I run a test script that uses Email::Send::SMTP::Gmail, I am able to send emails. But on my local computer(development), when I run the same script, it times out.
[21:40:13] <Grinnz> the perl interpreter itself is a binary executable
[21:40:17] <Grinnz> i was referring to that
[21:40:47] <krismatrix> I am wondering what is going on. It occurred to me that I am currently in a airnb. Could something be blocking the script from working? And what might be a way to confirm that?
[21:41:06] <krismatrix> I don't want to mess with airbnb place's setting. If that IS the problem, I'll just move on to another issue.

[21:42:18] <qq_78> complex grammars as in? their regex can do context free grammar?

[21:44:41] <Grinnz> i don't know enough to explain it, but basically grammars can be used for whole parsing tasks
[21:45:06] <Grinnz> you could ask more about that in #raku

[21:52:35] <qq_78> Ok, so if I wanted to learn Larry Wall's Perl, I would go for Perl 5, yes? The one that all *nix comes preinstalled with is Perl 5? The one that TeX people use is Perl 5.
[21:53:39] <Grinnz> correct
[21:53:54] <Grinnz> (but Raku is also Larry Wall's)
[21:55:13] <qq_78> Perl 5 it is, then.

[22:16:20] <aquanight> 10:09:17/6C519 < simcop2387> basically just do what you can to take bash out of the loop.  you almost certianly won't get hit by it at all but the fewer parts involved the less likely you are to get a surprise later ## going even further than this
[22:16:40] <aquanight> iptables (the CLI tool) almost certainly interacts with the kernel's netfilter somehow
[22:16:51] <aquanight> it might be worth while drilling down to that and bypassing iptables command line altogether
[22:18:39] <millican> yes. there likely is a way to do it without iptables, which isn't even installed by default on the debian base system.
[22:18:55] <millican> my day is getting filled with research :)
