[05:32:08] <gwern> ...remind you, you would never in a million years remember that there are multiple different isotopes of water and this seems to have some effect on living cells. You would never think to check whether attempts to mine the Martian icecaps for drinkable water will result in dangerous water that could sicken the unfortunate astronauts who drink it (answer: it might! Martian water has five times...

In 1996, it was estimated for 2007, fast forwarding a bit to 2018, it slipped one year from an estimated launch in 2020 to 2021, in 2020 it slipped from March 2021 to July, by January 2021 it slipped to October 31st, and it's been known since June, 14
[06:44:29] <rmmh> weeks ago, that it wasn't likely to meet that date. At this rate, I estimate the current date will intercept the target date in early 2022."
[06:46:18] <gwern> sounds like he'll be wrong then
[06:47:23] <gwern> or wait, did it launch or what?
[06:47:35] <ggreer> the launch is delayed until... we're not sure when

[21:36:23] <adiabatic> rsaarelm: does the uptick seem like astroturfing
[21:40:39] <PapuaHardyNet> Atomic Habits has been consistently recommended as *the* book on habits ever since itwas released
[21:40:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not sure why, it is garbage
[21:40:58] <PapuaHardyNet> in comparison to lots of books I've read on habits
[21:41:21] <PapuaHardyNet> my favorite book on habits is Stephen Guise - Mini Habits
[21:41:34] <rsaarelm> How's Atomic Habits garbage?
[21:42:09] <rsaarelm> Anyway, checking out Mini Habits as well, thanks for the recommend.
[21:43:23] <PapuaHardyNet> reading Atomic Habits doesn't result in any long term practical changes imo and the concepts in the book are mostly obvious, and covered far better by the book The Power of Habits

[23:04:01] <kuudes> ivan, not all people exit browser ever
[23:07:13] <pompolic> i like how the cookie notice becomes a dark pattern gallery
[23:07:14] <ggreer> I don't see cookie notices very often. if you use ublock origin and enable adguard's annoyances filter and ublock's annoyances filter, the cookie notices mostly disappear
[23:07:47] <pompolic> what will we get today? misleading coloring? ambiguous wording? 3 modal dialogs to do what should be the default? so exciting
[23:08:06] <kuudes> well, cookie notices existing and ignoring DNT is the original dark patterns
[23:08:10] <ggreer> see also: https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/

[23:08:24] <Robomot> I don't care about cookies 3.3.2 (Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!)
[23:08:29] <pompolic> sure
[23:08:35] <pompolic> i don't think GDPR caused the rot
[23:08:38] <pompolic> but it reveals it
[23:08:41] <kuudes> ie when you have DNT=1 you should not be served a cookie notice but it should be done as if you have rejected cookies
[23:08:53] <kuudes> but we are still at least one lawsuit away from that
[23:09:06] <ggreer> yeah but edge enabled DNT by default so everyone ignored it
[23:09:10] <kuudes> and the tracking industry is good at using money to stuff one's ears
[23:09:16] <kuudes> ggreer, yes, but that was before gdpr
[23:09:19] <kuudes> gdpr is the law
[23:09:33] <kuudes> and acting that way currently likely is against the law
[23:09:43] <kuudes> but, so far stuffing money in ears has worked
[23:09:57] <ggreer> shows how useful that law is
[23:09:57] <pompolic> i think they are counting on nobody bothering to snitch
[23:10:02] <pompolic> which, to be fair, is true for me
[23:10:13] <rsaarelm> Babylon Bee needs to learn the thing from The Onion where it's enough to just leave it at the photo and the caption sometimes.
[23:10:25] <ggreer> ublock origin has done more to improve privacy and convenience than all the EU's laws
[23:10:25] <kuudes> well the current thing is "DNT got deprecated and therefore no one can know what should be done when getting a header DNT=1"
[23:11:05] <gwern> ggreer: using AKS also helps because a lot of cookiee banners seem to be stickies
[23:11:05] <pompolic> i like umatrix's approach
[23:11:13] <pompolic> where websites may set cookies
[23:11:22] <pompolic> but it stops the browser from sending them back
[23:11:52] <pompolic> i think the deeper problem is clients being engineered to betray you, also
[23:14:03] <kuudes> ip tracking on server side is a thing you can't opt out with technicalities only
[23:14:26] <kuudes> the point is to be able to disable tracking, not just cookies
[23:15:46] <pompolic> i wonder what light that puts the recent ProtonMail thing in
[23:16:38] <ggreer> what? "setting" cookies is just the server sending a set-cookie header. if the browser doesn't send back the cookies in its own request headers, it's the same as not having cookies
[23:17:02] <pompolic> fwiw that's precisely what umatrix lets you control
[23:17:16] <pompolic> which is why i said i like it
[23:17:36] <pompolic> shifting the default from betraying you to letting you opt in
[23:18:11] <pompolic> although to be fair "send cookies" was not intended to be betrayal, probably
[23:19:06] <pompolic> there's the "ought" (policy) and then there's the "is" (the technicalities)
