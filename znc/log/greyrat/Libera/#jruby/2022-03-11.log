[01:35:39] <headius> ahorek confirmed my arch fix and has an additional one for the -m bit width flag
[01:35:49] <headius> I asked him to retarget it for 9.3
[01:39:54] <enebo[m]> nice
[02:27:26] <headius> we could probably use a 9.3.4 soon
[02:36:58] <enebo[m]> yeah
[02:55:44] <headius> enebo: I saw this httpx library released with some update for JRuby so I'm running tests, but the first thing that fails is due to JRuby.runtime not being defined anymore
[02:55:49] <headius> NoMethodError: undefined method `runtime' for JRuby:Module
[02:55:49] <headius>             <main> at /Users/headius/projects/jruby-9.3/lib/ruby/gems/shared/gems/ruby-ll-2.1.2-java/lib/ll/setup.rb:10
[02:55:55] <headius> I'll look into that in ruby-ll
[02:56:51] <headius> oh great, this is a YorickPeterse project that has been abandoned
[03:04:01] <headius> yeah it is using Oga
[03:04:16] <enebo[m]> you can patch from httpx by requiring before it
[03:04:32] <headius> yeah I threw it in test_helper so I can at least run the tests
[03:04:38] <enebo[m]> arguably not as desirable
[03:04:38] <headius> https://gitlab.com/honeyryderchuck/httpx/-/issues/185
[03:05:45] <headius> test suite is pretty slow but only 2F2E so far
[09:26:05] <headius> 9.3 merged to master

[21:30:53] <headius> enebo: I'm adding an unconditional nightly snapshot build for master at 6:30 UTC
[21:31:03] <headius> should be a time when the least activity is going into repo
[21:31:45] <enebo[m]> sounds good
[21:33:23] <headius> this will feed into having a snapshot docker images, which has been requested by a few folks

[22:00:06] <headius> enebo: how are we handling priority of failures that are not specifically new 2.7-3.1 stuff?
[22:00:30] <headius> the first one I look at today is not guarded by version, probably just got marked as wip because of a spec update
[22:00:59] <headius>   it "reads the contents of the file with default encoding" do... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/c63c802d8d022583e086886a3aca9828321140f2)
[22:01:08] <enebo[m]> yeah there had been a few PRs which ended up getting tagged normally
[22:01:32] <headius> oh, actually this one is passing... not sure how it got marked as WIP
[22:01:41] <headius> but the question stands
[22:01:44] <enebo[m]> I think personally it depends on how important it is as a failure but if it is important it probably should be considered for 9.3
[22:02:13] <headius> so case by case
[22:02:37] <enebo[m]> we could be more dogmatic about this but we should just evaluate it.  It would be nice to realize it is 2.6 in case it should be fixed on jruby-9.3
[22:02:55] <enebo[m]> but since we know we have those cases we should just verify it is really 2.7+ perhaps
[22:03:26] <enebo[m]> I do quite a few fixes where I extract the test to a script so in those cases I think it is easy to check
[22:03:40] <headius> ok
[22:03:48] <enebo[m]> but I think we both can somewhat see that it is a new option or something like that
[23:17:49] <headius> ok I'm skipping this argf thing
[23:17:56] <headius> it only fails in a full run and I can't figure out what triggers it
[23:18:18] <headius> there's a lot of default_internal/external juggling in these specs so who knows
[23:18:55] <headius> moving it to fails and we can try to do an argf pass some time
[23:19:13] <enebo[m]> argf is not a huge thing for JRuby
[23:19:28] <enebo[m]> and we obviously pass most basic behavior
[23:19:30] <headius> you mean people aren't using us for heavy command-line processing of files?!
