[20:16:06] <vhs43[m]> Evolver, none of the hodler care about fairness to new generations. We have to work much harder now to get gold out of the ground than the people in Klondyke 1849. it's just life
[20:17:04] <Evolver> vhs43[m]: good point (about gold mining being harder), but at least it's still possible. With BTC people can claim that it's not even possible to mine it anymore (and so that's  different level of unfairness)
[20:17:26] <AndyS2_> newer generations would be better served with a bit of real estate to build a house on, that stuff becomes impossibly expensive if a city grows and rarer, too
[20:17:44] <Evolver> in China they just grow new cities
[20:18:07] <vhs43[m]> And the balance between hash rate/security/energy cost/BTC price etc. is multidimensional and has alignment of incentives so I don't think this is a valid concern
[20:18:07] <Evolver> so many that they have many unused cities
[20:19:08] <vhs43[m]> There will always be BTC to mine. Just no subsidy. That was just to emit the initial money supply, and future generations will have to live without that
[20:20:07] <Evolver> I foresee a strong movement which will claim that it's very unfair that Bitcoin doesn't value itself beyond 21 million
[20:22:12] *** Joins: Lightsword (~Lightswor@user/lightsword)
[20:22:48] <Evolver> They may claim something like just increasing the number to 42 million will cause it to last maybe +1000 years, although I don't know how long it'll take.
[20:24:21] <vhs43[m]> So what who cares? Nobody will join but themselves. Ye another shitcoin will be born and die 🤷‍♂️
[20:25:40] <Evolver> Keep saying that until one day it's no longer true

[22:58:36] <Evolver> I'm very afraid of arbitrary limits, e.g. 21e6

[23:04:05] <Evolver> Think about this in the other direction. What if various governments ask Bitctoin to have only 20e6 instead of 21e6 under penalty of miner imprisonment.

[23:04:52] <earnestly> Evolver: The question is, can governments kill bitcoin.  Yes, they can do a tremendous amount of harm, if not kill it.
[23:05:07] <earnestly> I'm surprised they haven't tried yet
[23:05:08] <Evolver> no, but is 20e6 really harming or killing it
[23:05:15] <earnestly> Yes
[23:05:18] <Evolver> because I'm not convinced it is
[23:05:23] <Evolver> How
[23:05:27] <earnestly> Evolver: This to me is the gold argument.  FDR happened, the argument is over
[23:05:41] <Lyza> since we're talking about emission I wonder if anyone has opinions on the stability of btc when the coinbase reward is gone. unless I'm mistaken, no blockchain has yet survived purely on TX fees
[23:06:12] <earnestly> If you are able to witness such degree of cohersive force that do something that, you will exist in a world with such a degree of control that bitcoin would be the least of your concerns
[23:06:21] <earnestly> do/does
[23:06:54] <earnestly> Lyza: It needs to rely on the network effect, and that's a question no one knows yet
[23:07:06] <Evolver> Lyza: the tx fees would have to go higher imho
[23:07:14] <earnestly> Evolver: Or more tx's
[23:07:18] <Evolver> yes
[23:07:48] <earnestly> Which, if the network effect picks up, would likely be the case.  The question of scaling is more interesting to me than trying to fight against the solid economics
[23:07:51] <earnestly> Such as hdd space
[23:07:57] <shiza> Lyza: http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Altcoin#Useful_Cryptocurrencies
[23:09:27] <shiza> You are describing an useful cryptocurrency. Rejoice!
[23:09:50] <Lyza> huzzah!
[23:16:29] <Evolver> Speaking of hdd space, which space-efficient encoding does bitcoin software use? Is there research on better encodings? Has anyone tried applying a deep neural net to learn a better compression?

[23:19:31] <earnestly> It better be
[23:19:47] <Evolver> Some addresses would be a lot more active the others, wouldn't they?
[23:19:50] <earnestly> (Unless you mean little bits of metadata?)
[23:20:48] <Evolver> If address A1 has 100x more activity than address A2, should A1 really require 100x the space? Firstly, does it require 100x the space given the current encoding?
[23:21:03] <earnestly> That doesn't make sense to me
[23:23:53] <Evolver> The hdd space usage is another reason why transactions can't scale without limits.
[23:24:08] <Evolver> so to me it's more likely that the tx fees will go higher
[23:25:15] <Evolver> and layer2, sharding etc. will pick up the slack (as per current knowledge)
[23:26:01] <earnestly> Yes, layer2 seems like a smart direction to go
