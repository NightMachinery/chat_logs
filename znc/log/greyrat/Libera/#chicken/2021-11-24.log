[16:31:15] <Bunny351> bah, Lisp is so common...
[16:32:02] * Bunny351 would love a real implementation of LISP 1.5
[16:33:28] <Bunny351> minimalistic lispers all go for this bastard CL subset instead of appreciating the original Lisp, which was actually nice
[16:34:24] <Bunny351> especially given the system-constraints.
[16:47:32] <Bunny351> FEXPRs and A-lists and nothing of these Lisp-machine inspired historical accidents ("&rest", for god's sake...)
[16:49:14] <alexshendi> It's on nominally a CL subset . Function definition syntax is actually (defun fn (a b . r) ...) and it is a Lisp-1

[16:54:38] <alexshendi> There is also klisp, which can compile to a DOS COM executable. 
[16:56:07] <Bunny351> picolisp is great, but I find the docs messy.
[16:56:53] <Bunny351> also no FEXPRs, but I may be wrong
[16:58:50] <wasamasa> it does though
[16:59:20] <wasamasa> (de foo X X) returns the unevaluated argument list
[16:59:23] <Bunny351> oh, yes
[16:59:30] <alexshendi> picolisp has functions that don't evaluate their args. Counts as fexpr/nlambda in my book...
[16:59:38] <Bunny351> indeed

[19:17:28] <wasamasa> you didn't group them?
[19:17:49] <sandra> I have two grouped nicks, snan and sandra, but, I haven't been logged into either for a few weeks
[19:18:06] <sandra> I also have an ungrouped nick that my bot uses
[19:18:23] <sandra> That bot hasn't been logged in for even longer
[19:19:22] <alexshendi> What's the deal with grouping?
[19:19:41] <sandra> Reason why I hopped on here tonight was to say thank you for the chicken module system (compared to the Clojure namespace system). You know I complained about the prefix names to the point that I wrote a patch to strip them out on importing (that patch was rejected). Well, in Clojure land it's waaaay worse with the long prefix names! Everything is foo.bar.baz/quux
[19:20:29] <sandra> Even though I haven't been logged in (I'm sick and resting up) it's messed up that someone else could be impersonating me in the meanwhile!
[19:22:32] <sandra> So, /msg NickServ set enforce on
[19:22:39] <sandra> I didn't know you had to do that
[19:24:32] <teiresias> Well, they could impersonate you, but they wouldn't get your cloak unless they could actually authenticate as you.
[19:24:44] <sandra> In Chicken you can import stuff unambiguously into your module with renames and only and flowers and wedding dress. Names are local♥
[19:25:03] <sandra> Right, but, normally people don't look at the cloak unless the person is acting reaaaally sus

[19:36:53] <ente> someone took my nick when freenode became libera, on both libera and oftc

[19:44:56] <ente> go back to doing something awesome, I'll deal with it
[19:45:33] <sandra> I just popped in to praise the module system♥
[19:46:27] <sandra> The whole name spaces thing in Clojure is probably the number one thing I miss from Chicken when doing Clojure stuff. As in, I miss the lack of namespaces♥♥♥♥
[19:48:32] <sandra> amazigh: ah! Thanks for explaining your old nick!
[19:51:25] <amazigh> I do not know how namespacing works with clojure.
[19:51:38] <wasamasa> sort of like in CL
[19:51:46] <amazigh> I guess chicken modules looks like r7rs libraries somehow?
[19:51:50] <amazigh> hmm
[19:52:24] <wasamasa> you have a ns macro to switch into a namespace and perform the necessary library imports
[19:53:01] <sandra> In Clojure you need to write the namespace in front of the important function foo.bar.baz/quux or if you have imported the namespace with an alias foo/quux. Or you can import just the function if you wanna write just quux and that's awesome
[19:53:08] <wasamasa> the development workflow is driven by switching to the correct namespace and evaluating code in it
[19:57:37] <sandra> That's fine, the frustrating part is more the whole type-something-so-long/frobnicate
[19:57:55] <wasamasa> clojure does fix some of the CL oddities though
[19:58:01] <sandra> Or, well, typing is instantaneous with Esc-/ in Emacs but then reading it
[19:58:12] <wasamasa> no importing all the things
[19:59:15] <sandra> As far as CL goes, the most annoying thing is in both it and Clojure. That keywords have the : character first :like :this
