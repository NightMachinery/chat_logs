[00:14:10] <pgiarrusso>  romachkuna that command line runs the `code` command with `Code.exe` as an argument, that seems wrong

[04:00:28] <quartz> Anyone want to talk me through this problem? https://i.ibb.co/FbDvQ15/3b.png  Are they asking to implement a function to use floats or not? Here is my solution to the previous problem: https://godbolt.org/z/nMGq6fdx6
[04:02:26] *** Quits: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:09:02] <d_bot_> <NULL> The equality operator is `(=)`, `(==)` is for physical equality (same memory address)
[04:10:31] <d_bot_> <NULL> They are asking you to implement a function which takes the addition function as input and therefore doesn't impose a particular return type (`'a`)
[04:11:29] <quartz> 'a is used for generics?
[04:12:02] <sleepydog> yes, it's a type variable, a placeholder for some type

[04:12:59] <quartz> But the name of the functio is suppose to be accum or partial?
[04:13:53] <quartz> The function signature is: "let rec partial accum f =" so does that mean accum accepts a variable f and partial accepts as a parameter accum?
[04:14:35] <sleepydog> no, it means 'partial' accepts 2 arguments, both of which are functions
[04:15:04] <quartz> So the question is asking to implement the partial function only?
[04:15:14] <sleepydog> yes
[04:15:15] <quartz> Or is it three functions? lol
[04:15:33] <sleepydog> it gives you several examples of possible `accum` and `f` implementations
[04:16:11] <sleepydog> they want you to define `partial`, which sould be agnostic to what types `accum` and `f` use

[04:24:52] <quartz> sleepydog: Any hints as for how I should do that? What is the purpose of using generics here?
[04:35:26] <quartz> I'm assuming generics is needed here because I want the function to accept either an int or a float. If it accepts a float, it will return a float and if it accepts an int it will accept an int
[04:36:07] <sleepydog> quartz: your solution to the previous question requires minimal changes for this one
[04:37:56] <quartz> Replace the + with accum?
[04:38:03] <quartz> I'm assuming

[05:18:41] <sleepydog> the compiler is not complaining about that one yet. it's complaining about the first leg of your if statement, when n == 1.
[05:19:05] <sleepydog> (note NULL's remark that you should be using = here, not ==)
[05:19:53] <quartz> Weird, == worked fine in the last problem.
[05:20:22] <sleepydog> it works fine, but it means something subtly different.
[05:20:43] <sleepydog> in other contexts it won't work like you expect it to
[05:22:28] <quartz> Ok... but accum should work here, it takes two parameters....
[05:26:17] <sleepydog> you have `if n == 1 then accum n else ...`; i only see 1 parameter to `accum` there.
[05:26:45] <quartz> omg
[05:27:00] <sleepydog> so what should the second argument be? :)
[05:27:28] <sleepydog> remember, you don't know if you're dealing with an int or a float
[05:28:34] <quartz> Another if statement?
[05:29:45] <sleepydog> it's the last puzzle you have to solve. the only other error i see is you need parenthesis around the call to aux. good luck! :)

[20:11:01] <Anarchos> sleepydog  i think the wait3 with -lbsd comes from the ocaml compiler itself
[20:14:15] <sleepydog> https://github.com/ocaml/dune/blob/main/otherlibs/stdune/wait3_stubs.c
[20:15:07] <sleepydog> i got an error about a missing reference to wait3 when building dune. i looked around and saw there is a `wait3` implementation in libbsd on haiku
[20:15:38] <sleepydog> but i'm not familiar enough with the process of buliding dune to add that flag. simply adding it to LDFLAGS didn't work
[20:17:37] <Anarchos> sleepydog let me look
[20:18:22] <Anarchos> sleepydog i had to stick to branch 2.9 for dune due to that.

[21:34:33] <sleepydog> so, i've been working on a code generator, and it involves the typical lex->parse->ast->ast transform flow. i took a break and came back to it, and i hate the code i wrote to manipulate the AST. it's in a "nanopass" style, but there are like 15 passes, the ordering is very fragile, and there's tons of indentation and nesting to walk the tree
[21:34:56] <sleepydog> so i've been thinking about different ways to do it
[21:36:15] <sleepydog> one idea i had was to load the terms into a database and manipulate them with a logic programming language like prolog or datalog
[21:36:46] <sleepydog> i wonder if there are other well-known techniques for manipulating ASTs, or if it's just something you get better at with practice
[21:37:16] <Anarchos> sleepydog that is the weirdest  AST manipulation i ever heard : load them in a database and manipulate them with prolog :)
[21:38:49] <sleepydog> yea, it sounds weird, but i've found some precedent for it. microsoft has a paper about a tool they wrote called "astlog" that they used to query codebases
[21:42:43] <sleepydog> it's also really hard to search for this topic in google
