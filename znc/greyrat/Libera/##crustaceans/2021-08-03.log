[08:08:52] <quanticle> I've long thought about using Matrix as an IRC client, but the trouble is that the Matrix bridge tends to be not that reliable?
[08:09:11] <quanticle> At least on old Freenode, I remember there would the time when you'd have mass-quits because the Matrix bridge collapsed
[08:12:49] <goodger[m]> that is also true of netsplits

[17:54:48] <cb> wow! no dependency resolution! just what i want, spend more time debugging why unix garbage won't start
[17:55:35] <gwozniak> My needs are very minimal, so maybe it will be okay. Also, I'm curious to see how good/bad it is
[17:56:04] <cb> i think tbh it'll be for linux boomers
[17:56:17] <cb> the kind of person who'd use slackware in 1997 would prob use gentoo or arch in 2021
[17:56:17] <gwozniak> Technically, I fall into that category
[17:56:30] <epilys> if anyone here hasn't read Unix Haters Handbook already, do so
[17:56:35] <cb> gwozniak: are you carrying over an fvwm config from the 90s and refuse to use anything else?
[17:56:45] <cb> epilys: i have and i'm strongly considering writing a modern update to it
[17:56:47] <gwozniak> I don't use the desktop
[17:56:59] <cb> the linux desktop is a disappointment, who can blame you
[17:57:00] <gwozniak> I don't even have a monitor hooked up to the machine
[17:57:18] <cb> epilys: some of the issues are like just old commercial unix things but so much still is structural
[17:57:24] <epilys> yee it's very dated
[17:57:26] <epilys> but still fun
[17:57:30] <cb> gdb is the most hateful debugger i've ever used
[17:57:33] <gwozniak> Yeah, I should read it again
[17:57:43] <cb> i'm doing a little hobby project in VC++6
[17:57:50] <cb> and i have to say it's depressing how much better the debugger is
[17:58:00] <epilys> my desktop has a bad sound card which amplifies every noise in the computer, for example if I plug in a phone and type something in the keyboard I can hear the noise going "GGgsglzgg"
[17:58:16] <epilys> If  I learn to recognize the noise would I also not have to have a monitor?
[17:58:17] <cb> you just got realtek'd
[17:58:28] <cb> anyways, vc++6 doesn't have an immediate window (VS.NET fixes that)
[17:58:35] <cb> but shitt like attaching to a process ACTUALLY WORKS
[17:58:43] <cb> in gdb it might work but you're prob not getting symbols
[17:58:45] <epilys> modern gdb isn't that bad
[17:58:56] <cb> i use it on AIX amd64 linux
[17:59:02] <cb> amd64 linux it works but the UX sucks
[17:59:02] <epilys> if they added a proper python API it'd be perfect
[17:59:08] <cb> on AIX it's insanely awful
[17:59:48] <cb> we're talking "step goes through comments in #ifdef WIN32", "selecting different stack frames changes how arguments appear", "arguments don't match the contents of registers"
[18:00:18] <cb> it can't understand va_args or wchar_t* either
[18:00:24] <cb> i never know if the fucked up value i see in a program is a gdb bug or actual program bug
[18:00:33] <cb> *AIX and
[18:00:37] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: How do you get output from the machine? Do you get tazed in morse or something?
[18:01:06] <Brekkjern> That is actually not a too bad idea for a joke project when I think about it...
[18:01:22] <gwozniak> I think gdb works well on Linux. I have no issues with it when debugging gcc and friends. But it is not super friendly
[18:01:41] <cb> for me i never got "programming is better on linux"
[18:01:46] <cb> it's not unless you do posix development
[18:02:01] <epilys> gdb+rr is heaven
[18:02:05] <cb> i started learning programming in visual studio so the unix programming workflow is like dumping chamberpots into the street
[18:02:17] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: I only SSH into it to do stuff (like irc...), use it as a local web and file server
[18:02:24] <cb> i know vi fluently but i don't feel any more productive than i did in VS
[18:02:38] <gwozniak> I used VSCode for debugging a Windows app and it was fine
[18:02:55] <cb> vscode != vs; the latter is a full IDE more comparable to emacs extensible with COM
[18:02:58] <gwozniak> Downloading the symbols took over 20 minutes, tho
[18:03:07] <cb> yeah .pdbs suck on windows
[18:03:42] <gwozniak> I've never had a chance to use VS. It's always something that cost too much and no one would pay for
[18:04:00] <gwozniak> And I've never had to develop anything on Windows
[18:04:19] <cb> it's been free for a long time
[18:04:55] <cb> but yeah, in the windows programming environment, i feel like i'm actually able to design useful things for people. in the unix one i feel like i'm fighting the environment and reimplementing basic shit
[18:05:04] <gwozniak> When I did have to debug that Windows app, I was told to use VSCode. (Everything was configured for it already, apparently)
[18:05:27] <gwozniak> I don't work in software that is all that "user facing"
[18:05:40] <Brekkjern> cb: Of course you are reimplementing basic shit. Nobody can agree on any decent interface standard, so we're still stuck with a file picker that doesn't render thumbnails...
[18:06:00] <cb> as much as i'm not a fan VSC will survive in the long run bc JS plugin ecosystem, making concessions and getting the mindshare of people who live in unix programming envs
[18:06:18] <gwozniak> For some reason Windows never renders thumbnails for me in the file picker
[18:06:26] <gwozniak> I must have turned something off
[18:06:28] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[18:06:39] <cb> Brekkjern: my most nuclear take is i feel the free software desktop is ok but all that source access to me seems useless
[18:06:43] <Brekkjern> You probably have set the computer to a "performance mode" or something
[18:07:00] <cb> the windows and even mac environments i feel i've been able to hack on programs in my environment and extend the environment easily
[18:07:11] <gwozniak> I really need to fix the colour nonesense in Powershell so I can get familiar with it
[18:07:27] <cb> i've written a windows shell extension and only a coupel of months after getting a mac i was able to fix bugs in a program i used
[18:07:37] <cb> i couldn't tell you how to do either in the x11 parts bin
[18:07:52] <gwozniak> It's not worth it in the x11 world
[18:07:53] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Type "performance" into the search and select "Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows". Check "Show thumbnails instead of icons"
[18:08:08] <cb> you could say kde and gnome are overcomplicated but the reality is there's no nexii and poor tooling
[18:08:12] <cb> there's nothing TO extend
[18:08:24] <cb> it feels all like rigid tech demos
[18:08:58] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: will have to try that when I'm at my Windows machine
[18:08:59] <Brekkjern> I've always found the desktop environment to be stuttery or floaty when I used Linux :S
[18:09:21] <Brekkjern> Mouse lagging behind where I think it is. Not sure if it's a rendering problem, or an input problem
[18:09:40] <gwozniak> Fonts/rendering never looks right, which has always been my biggest beef with Linux desktops
[18:09:54] <epilys> never had those issues tbh
[18:10:07] <epilys> are you using power hogs like gnome or kde?
[18:10:16] <cb> fonts are the least of my worries on linux
[18:11:28] <gwozniak> That, and cut'n paste is a fucking mess
[18:11:47] <Brekkjern> Last time I tried out Linux as my desktop I ran Arch and used Sway
[18:11:48] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, the Linux Subsystem for SystemD, or as I've recently taken to calling it, LSD. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of fully functioning SystemD.
[18:11:49] <gwozniak> epilys: I have used Gnome, KDE and pretty much everything in between

[18:13:24] <gwozniak> I live with Windows, although it can't get multiple monitors right
[18:13:34] <gwozniak> Only the Mac seems to do that
[18:13:47] <cb> i've done everything from simple i3 setups to what i do now, daily driving gnome 3
[18:13:54] <Brekkjern> Huh. First time I've heard of people having issues with multi-monitor on Windows
[18:14:16] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: it doesn't remember window positions, which is incredibly obnoxious
[18:14:29] <Brekkjern> I've never had that issue. Weird.
[18:15:10] <gwozniak> I plug in the monitor to the laptop and I always have to resize/reset the window locations
[18:15:22] <gwozniak> It's never worked
[18:16:59] <Brekkjern> I use a desktop, so I don't have that issue much
[18:17:09] <Brekkjern> Only happens when the driver is updated for me
[18:19:45] <gwozniak> As a desktop environment, Windows is sufficient for me, tho

[20:17:23] <Xe> > From July 2021 no more connections to freenode could be established. The network was accordingly classified as historic. During the 23 years and 11 months our data collector regularly connected IRC network freenode to determine its key performance indicators, such as its number of users and its number of chat rooms (IRC channels).

[20:26:48] <gwozniak> My employer has sent a message to all employees making it very clear that getting vaccinated is the smart thing to do, but it not mandating them for working in the office.  They are requiring masks for everyone who is in the office.

[21:45:08] <gwozniak> Oh Teams/Electron/modern apps.  How I wish I could throw thee into a flaming pyre and watch thee burn
[21:49:56] <Brekkjern> lol
[21:50:05] <Brekkjern> soc removed his comment in the systemd thread
[21:50:54] <gwozniak> Was it a "good" one?
[21:50:58] <Brekkjern> lolno
[21:51:10] <Brekkjern> "Why isn't it rewritten in rust?! REEEEEE!"
[21:54:07] <gwozniak> Figured it would be that useful
[21:59:05] <Brekkjern> I got curious, so I opened a subreddit to see what kind of stuff is posted there
[21:59:16] <Brekkjern> Now I think I might have terminal cancer
[22:04:05] <gwozniak> Quite the infection
[22:12:48] <Brekkjern> Indeed

[22:47:38] <ngoldbaum> the irc network that advocates for freedom‚Ä¶ wants you to register your nick for‚Ä¶ reasons?
[22:50:37] <kline> claims to advocate*
[22:50:55] <kline> ive yet to see any actual advocacy
[22:54:19] <gwozniak> Uh oh.  Early signs on this problem I'm looking at point to an inliner issue.  That will not be joyous.
[23:11:07] <indigo> gwozniak: Sadly no one wants to maintain 3+ different codebases
[23:15:13] <gwozniak> Three of us reported the same version of the app at work, but the available settings were not the same between the three of us.  There were at least two different versions of the settings screen
[23:15:31] <gwozniak> Mine changed after a few days with the same reported app version
