[12:34:01] <SpaceVimBot> <jjaimealeman> New user here. Loving SpaceVime and all it offers.
[12:34:01] <SpaceVimBot> <jjaimealeman> Am a FE WebDev and am transitioning away from VS Code. SpaceVim fit my needs perfectly. Watching a good video by DT/DistroTube and fell in love instantly.
[12:34:03] <SpaceVimBot> <jjaimealeman> First thing I did was change the colorscheme to Dracula (my fave). 
[12:34:04] <SpaceVimBot> <jjaimealeman> Can someone tell me how to change the colorscheme so it reflects on the "tabs" and the "airline" at the bottom?
