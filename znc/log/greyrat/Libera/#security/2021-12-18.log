[00:00:07] <critr> you mean apps that exists on the web and you use them through a browser or soemthing? that data is all exposed from the start probably.
[00:00:28] <ackpacket> sure
[00:01:05] <ackpacket> There are lots of holes.  State actor could for example compromise some entity in the cert chain and self sign something, then become a man in the middle
[00:01:20] <ackpacket> The the existence of some doesn't mean a lack of reason to solve others

[00:01:53] <ackpacket> If I have a webapp that was previously pushing plaintext to google cloud, and now my stuff doesn't hit googledrive without being encrypted, I think that's an improvement

[00:02:30] <critr> well, best you could do there is encrypt it and delete the original, but i wouldn't consider it private.
[00:02:49] <ackpacket> Might get lucky and the app provider doesn't store things very long :)

[00:56:25] <Paul84> joking

[00:59:27] <ajak> yeah, lots of time there's not much talk but also lots of time there's lots of talk so the trick is to idle or start conversation (as you seem to have done)

[01:01:15] <Hydragyrum> i.e. if you use gentoo, debian, arch, etc. those channels are often busy
[01:01:35] <Hydragyrum> and we talk security stuff when someone brings up a security-related topic that ends up being interesting
[01:01:41] <Doaky> The word 'can' makes it a request not a demand

[08:13:13] <jennie> B4ckBOne but drivers are only inf (speaking from my limited knowledge) how can it steal credit card information?
[08:13:35] <ajak> inf?
[08:13:44] <jennie> .INF files
[08:14:23] <Hydragyrum> the actual driver as installed is a chunk of code that runs in the kernel
[08:14:29] <jennie> ohhh
[08:14:47] <jennie> can kernel access internet from the computer?

[08:15:18] <B4ckBOne> jennie, bad actors can use it as a doorway to spread and do all kinds of stuff.

[08:16:05] <ajak> well strictly theoretically, sure
[08:16:08] <Hydragyrum> that might be a little paranoid, depends on how much you trust whoever provides those drivers
[08:16:09] <ajak> but do you trust the third party?
[08:16:29] <jennie> ajak i dont, its driver for chinese card readers eeprom drivers
[08:17:00] <ajak> if you don't trust code you shouldn't run it

[08:18:03] <jennie> B4ckBOne yes, now speaking of different device, which is a clean windows device fresh installation with only microsoft edge, can edge steal Credit card information?
[08:18:30] <Hydragyrum> as in since the last time the hard drive was securely wiped, nothing sensitive at all has touched it
[08:19:22] <Hydragyrum> and you'd want to make sure a machine running untrusted software doesn't have a mic or camera connected ever
[08:19:38] <B4ckBOne> jennie, Microsoft Edge is not designed to steal credit card information. Its a browser.
[08:19:59] <Hydragyrum> microsoft probably already has your cc info anyway
[08:19:59] <B4ckBOne> However with all things IT. It can be compromised.

[08:23:17] <ajak> if you think those are attacking you then uninstall them
[08:23:23] <Hydragyrum> the recommendation from the extra paranoid: use a dedicated machine, preferably a chromebook or linux device, for all your banking/etc. stuff and DO NOTHING ELSE WITH IT
[08:23:26] <B4ckBOne> jennie, keep updated. Minimize your attack surface by only using and installing neccesary things.

[08:24:06] <jennie> i think cc info can also be compromised on those linux based devices

[22:46:45] <gartt> And the problem is that the more usefulness you want your devices to have, the more vulnerable and less private they become. For example, if you have a Raspberry Pi that's airgapped and has a bunch of sensitive data, that's fine, but don't be expecting to be browsing the web with it
[22:47:55] <gartt> If you have a desktop that you interact with others via messaging, web browsing, etc, it's going to be less secure
[22:48:55] <gartt> Ice_: Nothing can be prevented, but you can make it extremely difficult/expensive for someone to snoop on you if you take a variety of fairly cheap measures
[22:49:12] <ajak> well, browsers are pretty secure as long as you update when uodates are available

[23:02:56] <Lvl4Sword> Especially considering NoScript, uBlock Origin, etc exist.
[23:03:43] <gartt> They're a big window against an APT, which I'm guessing Ice9 was mentioning
[23:04:20] <gartt> Maybe I assumed to much, but that's what I took "they" to mean
[23:04:35] <catbeard> nobody really wants to use noscript though because gawd website rely so much on javascript, especially as of late
[23:04:50] <catbeard> thanks to react and vue and whatnot
[23:04:52] * ajak uses noscrypt
[23:04:57] <catbeard> nos crypt
[23:04:58] <ajak> uh noscript, even
[23:05:02] <gartt> and Angular...
[23:05:04] <Lvl4Sword> I've been using NoScript for 15 years.. lol
[23:05:04] * gartt vomits
[23:05:25] <catbeard> i mean i was too until i actually started to need to get things done in a timely manner and do UI testing
[23:05:30] <gartt> Front-end development left me with such distaste that I changed careers
[23:05:42] <catbeard> backend and server/network admin all the way
[23:05:47] <catbeard> woo woo o/
[23:05:51] <ajak> do UI testing in a browser that isn't your noscript browser :P
[23:06:05] <catbeard> ajak: i just use a windows vm on another computer
[23:06:08] <ajak> exactly
[23:06:18] <gartt> catbeard: Yeah, that's the problem; front-end frameworks running websites are hugely common now, so you can't really block JS unless you only want to be able to use/browse a subset of the web
[23:06:43] <gartt> A browser in a VM probably makes the most sense for people who are very security-conscious

[23:06:51] <Lvl4Sword> I'm not 100% sure on what ice9 was talking about. Accessing systems that are offline? Who's "they"?
[23:07:39] <gartt> Lvl4Sword: If it's a party that can access systems that aren't connected made me assume he was talking about LE/intelligence agencies / govts / advanced threats
[23:07:42] <catbeard> gartt: on another computer, so no risk of vm escape, and if so then only to that computer which has none of my info/tools on it
[23:08:02] <catbeard> and is on a separate VLAN with a separate internet circuit
[23:08:25] <Lvl4Sword> gartt, It's too general of a question, and they'd need to detail their threat model.
[23:08:37] <catbeard> and of course a VPN tunnel on the router it's connected to
[23:08:48] <catbeard> so no client side vpn routing needed
[23:09:40] <catbeard> also that way no vpn cred leakage, unless i put a stupid password on the router or something which would be my bad
[23:10:09] <catbeard> most vpns though are certificate auth so don't really have to worry about that much
[23:10:41] <gartt> catbeard: That probably makes more sense
