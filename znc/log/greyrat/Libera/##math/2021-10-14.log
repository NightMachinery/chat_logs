[00:21:08] <cuppajoeman> How could I show that if Sigma has no model then Sigma |= _|_ ?
[00:21:38] <cuppajoeman> _|_ is the formula [ (f.a. x) x = x & ~ (f.a. x) x = x]
[00:22:21] <biberao> Hi so if a statement p: 5>1 its ~p is 5<=1
[00:22:23] <biberao> ?
[00:23:12] <somiaj> yes, the negation of a>b is a<=b
[00:23:31] <biberao> ok cool
[00:23:41] <biberao> just confirming
[00:24:39] <somiaj> at some level this is just by definition, usually you only define the order one way
[00:24:59] <somiaj> One way to kinda formalize a>b is a-b>0 or a-b is positive
[00:25:15] <somiaj> so you can define what it means for a real number to be positive or not.
[00:25:36] <somiaj> and then you can use the definition of positive to define the standard ordering on the real numbers.
[00:25:42] <biberao> i se

[06:01:38] <PlanckWalk> G√∂del's provability predicate is just a statement about properties of natural numbers.
[06:02:09] <brownorange> Explain.
[06:02:19] <PlanckWalk> Read the proof
[06:02:24] <brownorange> lol
[06:02:48] <PlanckWalk> Formal systems are about purely syntactic transformations.  Those correspond to arithmetic operations on numbers.
[06:03:18] <PlanckWalk> So provability is just a statement about a certain number being a result of certain arithmetic operations.
[06:03:53] <PlanckWalk> (via the correspondence)
[06:04:11] <PlanckWalk> The predicate *itself* is just the statement about numbers and arithmetic operations.
[06:04:30] <PlanckWalk> (Because PA can't express anything else)
[06:06:13] <brownorange> My understanding as far as Godel's results goe, is the undecidable statements were themselves issue, they are the sole cause not a symptom
[06:06:14] <PlanckWalk> Prov(n) is a predicate in the language of PA.  It *semantically* corresponds 1:1 with a statement about provability of statements in PA.
[06:06:52] <PlanckWalk> No, they're a symptom
[06:07:31] <brownorange> "The predicate *itself* is just the statement about numbers and arithmetic operations. " But this only means something because of Godel encoding
[06:07:32] <PlanckWalk> There are lots of unprovable statements in PA that have no correspondence with any provability predicate.

[06:08:59] <PlanckWalk> (It's also semantically about numbers, because things can have more than one meaning)
[06:09:32] <brownorange> but the statement that ends up undecidable is because of the belief you can make math talk about itself thanks to the godel numbering, and as you say "properties of natural numbers."

[06:20:55] <PlanckWalk> Useful completeness is, yes.
[06:20:55] <brownorange> (yes i understand we are talking Math specifically here)
[06:21:11] <Galois> if you have natural numbers, as in Peano axioms, then you cannot have completeness and consistency. This shouldn't be that surprising.
[06:21:46] <Galois> it's like trying to overhaul computer science to avoid the halting paradox. Sure, you can do that, just sacrifice turing completeness
[06:21:48] <PlanckWalk> Basically pick any two.
[06:22:48] <brownorange> I see no reason to accept statement that deny their own provability as true. They are afterall undecidable. There is no utility in their existence

[06:23:38] <Galois> your only other options are to accept them as false (which leads to inconsistency) or as undetermined (which leads to non-classical logic) or as undefined (which limits your system to something less than PA)
[06:24:38] <brownorange> PlanckWalk  I claim such self-negating statements are not provable in any reasonable system
[06:24:49] <PlanckWalk> It's not self-negating.
[06:25:15] <PlanckWalk> "M is not provable in T" does not mean "M is not true" or "M is not provable in U".
[06:25:17] <brownorange> It self-negates its own provability
[06:25:45] <PlanckWalk> It negates it's own provability *in a particular formal system*
[06:25:48] <brownorange> If you assumed an undecidable such as i'm thinking of as true, you could prove it via the axioms, and that would be and outright contradiction

[06:26:48] <PlanckWalk> "T is unprovable in PA" does not mean "T is unprovable in PA+Prov_{PA}(T)"

[07:43:06] *** Joins: emf (~emf@2620:10d:c090:400::5:c416)
[07:43:32] <PlanckWalk> Yes, in the sense that proof-strength is a partial ordering on such systems.
[07:44:16] <PlanckWalk> Well, it is on consistent systems.  Inconsistent ones can prove anything including their own and every other system's consistency. :-)

[07:46:07] <PlanckWalk> ZFC can prove PA consistent (by exhibiting a model)
[07:46:38] <zacts> is ZFC literally a set of axioms?
[07:47:17] <PlanckWalk> *Exactly* what it is depends upon context.
[07:47:29] <zacts> is it stated as a set of axioms?
[07:47:56] <PlanckWalk> Usually it means "some formal system that has these axiom schemata and some first order classical predicate logic with equality"
[07:48:10] <PlanckWalk> But without saying exactly which formal system it is.
[07:48:18] <PlanckWalk> Because that's, like, so tedious.
[07:48:43] <brownorange> There may be some violation of intuitive common sense to be proving one formal system with another, but I find many things about math a violation of intuition.
[07:48:43] <PlanckWalk> And there a lots of equivalent ones anyway, so anything you say with one you can translate mechanically to the others.
[07:49:54] <PlanckWalk> So in practice it's just "there's a whole bunch of formal systems that all basically do the same thing and we'll call them all ZFC"

[17:35:24] <nicoty> Given a list of integers from 0 with size "a" increasing by increments of 1, suppose this was split into chunks of size "b" (except for the last chunk which may be smaller than "b"), what formula would I use to I calculate the smallest multiple of a number "c" in a chunk 0-indexed by the index "d"? E.g., if "a" was 8, "b" was 4, "c" was 3 and "d" was 1, the formula should give the answer 6? Another example: if "a" was 14, "b" was 5, "c" was 4 and "d" was 2, the

[22:04:40] <twJizhan> (Disconnected (No such device or address)...)
[22:05:06] <Z-module> To be an orderable field at all, a field has to have char. 0, so it already contains a copy of Q.

[22:08:47] <Z-module> yes, since  |R| = [R:Q] = [R:K]*[K:Q]   where that last is cardinal multiplication, and for any infinite cardinals mu, nu,   mu*nu = max{mu, nu}
[22:09:07] <twJizhan> so containing Q must preserve this order property
[22:09:35] <Z-module> well, not all fields of char. 0 are orderable -- Q(i) is not, C is not.  But all orderable fields have char. 0.
[22:10:38] <greenbagels> Z-module: a familiar equation :)
[22:11:43] <Z-module> greenbagels: they do have to contain Q.  In any field L whatsoever, each subfield of L contains the 1 of L and thus also the subfield generated by 1. This last thing is always isomorphic to Q if char(L) = 0, or to F_p if char(L) = prime p.
[22:11:58] <Z-module> so every subfield of R contains Q

[22:19:34] <Z-module> and the thing about [R:K] being finite => K = R is from the fabulous Artin-Schreier theorem:  If L is any algebraically closed field (no char. assumed), and if K < L is a proper subfield with [L:K] finite, then:   they have char. 0,  K is orderable,  and  L = K(i)  where is a square root of -1, which forces [L:K] = 2.

[23:35:08] <tuskkk____> I have a binary format encoded in hex strings, how do I find the human readable string from it?
[23:35:22] <tuskkk____> e.g `"\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61"`
[23:35:42] <greenbagels> it doesnt have to be; a starting topic might be to talk about more familiar forms of approximations
[23:35:53] <greenbagels> like rational approximations of irrational numbers
[23:36:33] <tuskkk____> e.g `"\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61"`
[23:37:07] <greenbagels> tuskkk____: hex is meant to be semi-human-readable
[23:37:27] <tuskkk____> umm, I think there is binary within that hex
[23:38:30] <tuskkk____> there is mean to be a message hidden there, I need to find that
[23:38:33] <tuskkk____> meant*
[23:38:44] <greenbagels> no, those are octets written in hexadecimal
[23:39:12] <greenbagels> the first is 0xa01d8180000100010000000007657861 for example

[23:41:50] <tuskkk____> can you please explain what is an octect?
[23:41:58] <greenbagels> 8 bits
[23:42:18] <greenbagels> two hex digits = 256 possible values = 8 binary bits

[23:56:10] <LiaoTao> Not to be confused with octal notation

[23:58:40] <Oli> Thank you for correcting my mixture of nomenclature usage, LiaoTao.
[23:59:47] <Oli> swap pf*  Good signal of that is best that I focus on sleeping.
