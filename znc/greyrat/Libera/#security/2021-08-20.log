[01:02:06] <mats1>  an ordinary ice fire might take 300gals of water to put out with a typical rig's equipment, and teslas are on record requiring up to 32k gals. modern ice cars are quite a bit more combustible than before, due to all the added plastics to save on weight and cost, and the additional fuel is a problem

[01:03:14] <mats1> one of these days the planets will align and a fire precipitated in an underground garage below a multistory commercial building will pop off, and it'll bring it down
[01:03:47] <MadCamel> solution: everyone should drive a firetruck.
[01:03:48] <shibboleth> not unlike what was the plan the first time someone went after the twin towers?
[01:04:03] <mats1> i'm struggling to determine whether there are us mandates for high pressure water misting systems in parking garages, especially those under multistory buildings

[04:46:55] <Joanna> [iz]: if people were going to buy things anyway the advertising industry would not exist.
[04:47:32] <[iz]> that's not true, the ads are there to get them to buy THIER brand of beer instead of some other brand
[04:48:00] <Joanna> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays
[04:48:13] <[iz]> that's just marketing
[04:48:37] <[iz]> getting ppl to identify that brand with thier own personality and tapping into thier desire to communicate that to others around them by being a person that uses that brand
[04:49:08] <Joanna> Who is to say people would do anything that isn’t advertised if they don’t have to ?
[04:49:14] <[iz]> if i'm seen drinking this brand of beer, it says this about me.. but if i'm seen drinking this other brand of beer, it says something else
[04:49:30] <[iz]> like i said, there are lots of products with ads that push them and fail
[04:49:50] <[iz]> successful products usually go after markets that already exist, and just push out the competitors
[04:49:58] <Joanna> That too. The cigarette makers had all sorts of different cigarettes for different people to identify with
[04:50:11] <[iz]> yup, that's basically the essence of brand marketing
[04:50:25] <[iz]> they do it w/ beer and athletic gear and clothing and everything now
[04:50:30] <[iz]> laptops, phones
[04:52:05] <Joanna> People see an advertisement and want to go do what they see in ad. That’s why YouTube had to ban videos of people doing certain dangerous things because people imitate what they see.
[04:52:36] <[iz]> well, the real reason is b/c legal told them to ban then, or they could be liable for really expensive lawsuits

[05:09:34] <Joanna> A lot of people have misplaced trust in my opinion.
[05:09:50] <maddwabbit> for example?
[05:09:59] <[iz]> stapling your own finger?

[05:11:33] <Joanna> [iz]: if I had not heard the teacher suggesting that idea I 100% guarantee that I would not have stapled my finger.
[05:12:16] <[iz]> i've stapled my finger before by accident and it kinda sucked.. but also just pulled it out and meh

[05:16:29] <Joanna> At the time I didn’t even think of the obvious consequences of the staple poking into the finger my only thought was curiousity and it had to be ok because the teacher did it right ?
[05:17:11] <Joanna> People act without thinking and this is the problem.
[05:19:18] <Joanna> So if you are in a position of authority it’s really important to set a good example at all times .

[16:53:26] <TimMc> Seems like whack-a-mole, though. Root has... a lot of abilities to get around that, I'm quite sure.
[16:55:04] <TimMc> jaggz: Rebooting your modem *might* do it.
[16:55:14] <spb> seems to be of limited use given that root can just inject code into that process to access it
[16:56:06] <TimMc> jaggz: If the ISP's local network is heavily susbscribed, you might get a new IP on modem reboot. But they might maintain the DHCP lease and you just get the same IP again. Worth a shot, though.
[16:56:10] <piou> jaggz: no matter what your IP is it is scanned every single day by lots of bots looking for vulnerable devices or software. Changing your IP wouldn't do much. I wouldn't recommend spending time on this. What you can do is make sure to use a strong password, that your ip camera is up to date and that the camera isn't on the same network as equipments you care about (your computer mainly). That
[16:56:16] <piou> last point is the most difficult but also by far the most effective.

[22:38:24] <velix> TimMc: Dunno... in general.
[22:38:35] <velix> I've got cheap U2F tokes from Amazon. They're nice.
[22:38:40] <velix> $5 or such
[22:38:55] <TimMc> I haven't tried using them with SSH yet.
[22:39:25] <TimMc> although if my work's VPN would work with them, that would be cool

[23:20:32] <ilikeyou> could you even change the mac of the modem? depending on hardware, there might not even be an interface. and also they usually(always?) use modem mac to identify the connection. like if the mac changes, you'd have to notify the isp
[23:21:42] <[iz]> yeah, i think lots of them will lock the mac like that

[23:36:19] <ilikeyou> recently, i had checked if i could bypass the fiber -> ONT connection, and hook straight into isp fiber, but it doesn't look easy, lol. would be nice if a simple media converter would be work. supposedly it's guarded because the line-in is full-featured, and the ONT sets the restrictions. interesting. i think it was a hackernews thread
