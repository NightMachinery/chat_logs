[02:13:31] <[czar]> > pacman 6.0.0-5
[02:13:38] <Namarrgon> reinstall it properly now
[02:13:57] <Namarrgon> when you extract a package manually the local db doesn't get updated
[02:14:09] <[czar]> Whats a good way to update all the dependencies together?
[02:14:10] <baltazar> [czar]: just do a full system upgrade, but specify pacman explicitly, so it will "reinstall" itself
[02:14:10] <[czar]> I see
[02:14:18] <Namarrgon> -Syu
[02:14:22] <[czar]> Nah
[02:14:33] <[czar]> I'm running in a server
[02:14:40] <Namarrgon> baltazar: that will reinstall the new version, files that are not part of the new version might be left behind
[02:14:53] <Namarrgon> not tragic but can cause funny issues later
[02:15:05] <Namarrgon> "nah"?
[02:16:05] <[czar]> If I do a full upgrade it'll surely break a lot of things
[02:16:15] <Namarrgon> you just broke your system with a partial update and learned nothing?
[02:16:29] <baltazar> Namarrgon: fair point, a pacman -U /var/lib/pacman/pkg/pacman-5.2.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst shall fix it
[02:16:41] <Namarrgon> that or --dbonly
[02:16:49] <[czar]> First time I break pacman itself
[02:16:51] <baltazar> Namarrgon: huh, TIL
[02:18:48] <[czar]> All this time I thought pacman would update the dependencies together
[02:19:18] <[czar]> But now I get that it expects everything to be updated together
[02:19:19] <Namarrgon> it does when you do it properly
[02:19:41] <[czar]> How can I do it properly?
[02:19:45] <Namarrgon> -Syu
[02:20:14] <[czar]> I don't want to update "everything"
[02:20:22] <[czar]> Breaking one thing at time is okay
[02:20:25] <Namarrgon> arch does not support partial upgrades
[02:20:32] <sheep> you must update everything
[02:20:50] <sheep> arch does not attempt to make partial upgrades safe
[02:20:51] <[czar]> uptime: 23:49:48 up 359 days, 23:41
[02:21:09] <Namarrgon> uptime is a measurement for how vulnerable your system is

[06:58:27] <SponiX> gtlsgamr: normally the reason they are "flagged" is just that the are out of date from the upstream
[06:58:37] <SponiX> at least for the AUR
[06:58:49] <mefistofeles> yes, I think it's the same for the official repos packages
[06:59:09] <gtlsgamr> Alright makes sense. So say, if a package is flagged.. that means there might be some fixes from upstream that the package might be missing
[06:59:48] <SponiX> or it is being held because something it depends on needs an update 1st
[06:59:57] <SponiX> that was the case with my qbittorrent
[07:00:29] <gtlsgamr> Okay understood. Since the update on 20th vulkan seems to be messed up, probably some bug. 
[07:00:39] <gtlsgamr> None of my vulkan games are working
[07:01:41] <SponiX> hmm, normally when there is an "update" and something functions less, or not at all. It is referred to as a "regression"
[07:02:19] <gtlsgamr> And what is SOP in case of a regression?
[07:02:22] <SponiX> vulkan is pretty common, sure there are a few people reporting it, might web search to see if there are recommendations for a fix or work-a-round
[07:02:55] <SponiX> lol .. I don't know, I just live here ( new to Arch still myself )
[07:03:18] <SponiX> But, there is "reporting" within the packages site for both Arch internals and AUR
[07:03:50] <gtlsgamr> Okay, alright.
[07:03:52] <SponiX> BEFORE breaking out a report though, make sure you have done the simple shit like "reboot"
[07:04:33] <SponiX> I wrote up a nice one before about something not working, and it was just because of a kernel version mismatch where I installed a new kernel and hadn't rebooted for it to take effect :P

[08:39:32] <ishitatsuyuki> well, some people do maintain unofficial user repositories that people can directly add to pacman

[08:40:56] *** Quits: lordrishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[08:41:35] <ishitatsuyuki> Nah, one would do that in addition to uploading to AUR
[08:41:45] <ishitatsuyuki> e.g. when the package takes a lot of time to build
[08:41:49] <ishitatsuyuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_submission_guidelines#Creating_package_repositories

[08:42:51] <jmcantrell> ishitatsuyuki: what kind of a situation would require package signing?
[08:43:01] <SponiX> there are also aur binaries such as chia-bin
[08:43:24] <ishitatsuyuki> When you want to prove integrity. Really just that.
[08:44:03] <ishitatsuyuki> When you add a repo to pacman you can configure it to require signing or not
[08:44:06] <jmcantrell> i don't understand why you wouldn't want to do that in every case
[08:44:24] <ishitatsuyuki> When signing is not required it's just served in an as-is basis
[08:44:33] <ishitatsuyuki> Because signing doesn't always increase security.
[08:44:46] <jmcantrell> like "buyer beware"?

[11:18:03] <thurstylark> so if you're having a problem that was triggered by a driver change, the bootloader direction is barking up the wrong tree
[11:18:06] <igor> I'm not going int hat path.
[11:18:06] <thurstylark> that's my whole point
[11:18:21] <igor> thurstylark: agreed.
[11:18:32] <thurstylark> then what is the problem you're having?
[11:19:24] <igor> thurstylark: as I said before. I was able to use linux console at 3440x1440 using nouveau driver. When I installed nvidia driver, now I'm with a small res console in a big screen.

[19:17:37] <bparker_> I'm having a strange issue where any time my Xorg session is locked (lightdm, light-locker), something always consumes 90%+ of available RAM at the same time every night (around 10:30 PM local time)... and holds it until I sign back in, and then it drops way back down (from ~60GB of 64 used down to 8), but processes have already been oom-killed at that point. any idea what it could be? top/htop etc. 
[19:17:43] <bparker_> show no user or kernel thread actually consuming anywhere near that much memory
[19:17:57] <low-key> I had both of mine set to 1 because of some issue I ran into a long time ago and now the only font size that things look fine at are 10 which is a bit smaller than I'd like

[19:19:17] <Namarrgon> how do you start virt-viewer?
[19:19:42] <ixil> just through a qemu argument, `-display spice`
[19:19:48] <Namarrgon> then your assumption is wrong
[19:20:14] <Namarrgon> why do you not just run qemu as your regular user?
[19:20:33] <Namarrgon> both qemu and virt-viewer

[22:57:54] <uthurna> oh
[22:57:55] <mpan> If you have a lot of text to paste, use a paste service.
[22:58:06] <uthurna> yep sure, hold on a minut

[22:58:17] <uthurna> is ghostbin.com ok with you?

[23:05:12] <uthurna> here it is
[23:05:37] <mpan> uthurna: seems like you have messed up the fstab step.
[23:05:44] <uthurna> oh
[23:05:51] <uthurna> I didn't try re-doing that
[23:06:03] <uthurna> I only tried re-installing the linux package
[23:06:26] <uthurna> so I should repeat the step? or start installing from the beggining?

[23:07:41] <mpan> Just fix fstab, assuming it is wrong. But that is my guess. Basically you have wrong storage device (SSD, HDD, …) set somewhere.

[23:09:16] <uthurna> oh, the installation guide doesn't cover SSDs?
[23:09:51] <drat_> you can probably fix the fstab from the live installation using chroot
[23:09:58] <mpan> Or you have generated a wrong initramfs somehow.

[23:10:22] <mpan> uthurna: there is no need to cover SSDs separately.
[23:11:17] *** Joins: sidy (~sidy@user/sidy)
[23:11:49] <uthurna> so I will boot with the USB, mount the partitions, repeat the fstab steps?
[23:11:57] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@135.129.113.9)
[23:12:21] <mpan> uthurna: basically, re-check all the steps related to fstab and generating initramfs. In particular pay attention if you have mounted everything properly during the process and chrooted into the right directories. For example people often forget to mount a separate boot partition into /$MOUNT_POINT/boot during installation.

[23:12:54] <uthurna> OH I think that's what I messed up
[23:13:07] <mpan> That’s what I can guess for now.
[23:13:07] <uthurna> I don't think I mounted a seperate boot partition
[23:13:31] <uthurna> so I shoud do mount /dev/sda2/boot /mnt/boot ?
[23:13:51] <mpan> So likely initramfs was generated into a directory on your root filesystem. :P
[23:14:12] <mpan> uthurna: /dev/whatever-partition-is-your-boot-partition to /mnt/boot, assuming you mounted your root filesystem as /mnt.

[23:14:29] <mpan> But first check if /mnt/boot is empty and remove its contents if it is not, BEFORE MOUNTING ANYTHING INTO IT.
[23:14:29] <drat_> sda1 > /mnt sda2 >/mnt/boot
[23:14:40] <mpan> drat_: that depends on the layout.
[23:14:46] <drat_> well obviously
[23:14:52] <uthurna> my boot partition isn't the swap partition is it?

[23:18:06] <mpan> But since I don’t even use an UEFI system, I can’t provide any help with that.
[23:19:25] <uthurna> no worries I think I will find it, since we located the problem it's not gonna be that hard to fix it
[23:20:18] <mpan> Not really located. Just noticed it’s related to the path to the device not being set correctly somewhere, where “somewhere” may be many places and caused by many mistakes. ;)
