[10:01:11] <CapnKernel> Hello.  For things like JS packages, and fonts and icons etc, I'd like users of my production site to fetch these from a CDN.  But when I'm developing on my laptop (which may not be connected to the internet), I'd like to fetch these locally, like {% static %} provides.  Is there a recommended way of doing this?  (I'm using django.contrib.sites, so the solution could vary on the side id, if this helps)

[10:26:34] <audiocat> FunkyBob, you around
[10:27:18] <CapnKernel> gcbirzan: Hmm, I appreciate the suggestion but it doesn't do what I want.  (I already have nginx serving static content)
[10:27:54] <CapnKernel> For example, in the HTML my users see, I'd like <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.5.0"></script>, but for me it would be something local.
[10:35:44] <twomoon> do people need CDNs still?
[10:36:08] <twomoon> doesn't hosting it on amazon take away the need for a CDN?
[10:36:14] <twomoon> i'm confused again heh
[10:37:58] <gcbirzan> If you're thinking about cloudfront, that is a CDN.
[10:38:17] <gcbirzan> CapnKernel: Nowadays, with browsers not sharing caches, there's very little benefit to that.

[11:58:29] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[11:59:26] <FunkyBob> well, that's a little misleading
[11:59:46] <FunkyBob> "the same CDN asset" would, to my mind, mean the same URL... so the browser can cache it in most cases
[12:02:13] <gcbirzan> Yeah, but the cache is specific to the document that linked to that asset.
[12:05:18] <FunkyBob> to prevent sidechannel attacks or something?
[12:06:06] <gcbirzan> It's a privacy thing, so you cannot be tracked. Chrome did it last year, think Firefox this year
[12:06:14] <gcbirzan> yeah: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/

[12:18:44] <FunkyBob> well, without marketing we can't have free stuff, basically.

[12:51:39] <audiocat> FunkyBob, mssql
[12:51:50] <wallbroken> does django give some json connector?
[12:52:06] <wallbroken> i need to have some data report from the server
[12:52:21] <wallbroken> because it has going to feed another ERP
[12:52:40] <FunkyBob> what is a "json connector"?
[12:53:07] <FunkyBob> audiocat: ah, ok... so when you say 'manually increment'?
[12:53:10] <wallbroken> it's URI based interface where to pull what i said
[12:53:29] <gcbirzan> CapnKernel: To be fair, most people nowadays a) serve their own static stuff, and b) bundle their js/css, so it's not such a big issue.
[12:53:36] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: "what i said" was... nothing. you said you need to feed another ERP... but not what you need to feed it.
[12:54:01] <FunkyBob> audiocat: you want to assign the pk as MAX(pk)+1 or somethiing?
[12:54:06] <FunkyBob> audiocat: how does mssql normally handle this?

[12:54:52] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: well, as you've already seen it's quite simple to generate JSON responses in django
[12:54:54] <wallbroken> they need that for some analytics system report
[12:54:57] <audiocat> FunkyBob, and yes

[12:56:29] <FunkyBob> does seem like there is an autofield type in mssql...

[12:56:59] <wallbroken> so: key - value
[12:57:15] <audiocat> FunkyBob, you cant convert from an integerfield to autofield in django
[12:57:19] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: then you would use a dict.
[12:57:40] <FunkyBob> audiocat: the _existing_ schema didn't already use it?
[12:57:43] <wallbroken> inside a list?
[12:57:54] <wallbroken> it should be a complex data structure
[12:58:12] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: how t he fuck would we know? you're the one with the spec
[12:58:40] <audiocat> FunkyBob, no. i'm looking at the schema and data in mssql mgmt studio, it just says its an int
[12:58:49] <FunkyBob> audiocat: most auto fields are...
[12:59:18] <FunkyBob> https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-define-an-auto-increment-primary-key-in-sql-server/

[13:52:00] <rickyoo> Hello all.
[13:54:18] <anorthall> can someone take a look at this please? https://bpa.st/HMZQ
[13:54:20] <anorthall> rickyoo: hi
[13:56:08] <rickyoo> Is there a way to put templates in records?  E.g. I have some TextField containing the string "Check out {{ description }} for more details".  When I do this it renders it literally as {{ description }} rather than using the description I've passed from the view function.
[13:56:42] <anorthall> rickyoo: so you want to render information from the database using template tags?
[13:56:54] <anorthall> I do this in my app, let me find the code
[13:57:08] <FunkyBob> rickyoo: i did a tempalte filter years ago to let you pass values through and re-parse/render them as template fragments
[13:57:10] <rickyoo> Yeah, I hope I am explaining myself correctly.
[13:57:15] <rickyoo> That sounds right.
[13:57:31] <GinFuyou> rickyoo, it's not problem of putting, it's problem that you don't pass it through rendering
[13:57:39] <rickyoo> I see
[13:57:50] <GinFuyou> if you just output it, it will treat it as plain text
[13:57:56] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/funkybob/kopytka/blob/master/kopytka/templatetags/cms.py
[13:58:07] <duoi> rickyoo it really depends on how youve set things up, you need to pass it into a rendering function with the attributes as context
[13:58:12] <duoi> it would help if you post your view
[13:58:32] <GinFuyou> Or you could just manually render it in the view or model method
[13:58:33] <anorthall> rickyoo: https://bpa.st/USKA
[13:59:04] <anorthall> rickyoo: you'd have to replace Context() with the context you wanted ... e.g., Context({'description': 'this is a description'})
[14:02:18] <anorthall> rickyoo: honestly I think FunkyBob's approach is a better one for what you want. my approach is designed to be used in big blocks of content (blog posts) that may have many tags included
[14:03:27] <anorthall> >> any ideas on this? https://bpa.st/HMZQ

[16:07:48] <kezabelle> apollo13: ping for if/when you're around. I spy you, you've been playing with unpoly lately. How are you finding it (or did CSP make it a non-starter)?
[16:10:17] <serafeim> isn't unpoly similar to htmx ?
[16:11:26] <kezabelle> yes and no
[16:11:57] <kezabelle> it's similar to intercooler/turbolinks/htmx etc in that it's essentially pjax on steroids
[16:12:50] <kezabelle> buuut unpoly has builtin primitives for "layers" (modals, drawers etc)
[16:13:11] <kezabelle> where intercoolerjs and htmx are AFAIK more barebones about "make AJAX a first class citizen of HTML"
[16:13:51] <kezabelle> I like intercoolerjs quite a bit (haven't bothered trying htmx), but I'm playing with unpoly2 now as it's consolidated those drawers/modals etc into one concept finally.
[16:14:31] <kezabelle> and ... well there's turbolinks, which was fine (but now it's turbo?... they're always replacing it), and swup was decent with plugins, etc.
[16:16:39] <serafeim> yes i've used some of these technologies
[16:17:16] <serafeim> i think the easiest is turbolinks because it's completely plug n play, without any changes to your code
[16:17:24] <kezabelle> yeah
[16:17:28] <kezabelle> tbf, so is unpoly2
[16:17:42] <kezabelle> well, 2 lines of config to set it up.
[16:17:58] <serafeim> hm really? i'll take a look at it
[16:18:31] <kezabelle> https://demo.unpoly.com/ fwiw
[16:18:39] <kezabelle> shows off modals etc
[16:18:52] <serafeim> in the docs it says that you need to add some attributes to the html
[16:19:01] <serafeim> up-target etc
[16:19:23] <kezabelle> indeed, but also, https://unpoly.com/handling-everything
[16:19:45] <serafeim> ah ok
[16:19:50] <kezabelle> as it happens, having just opened a ticket, here's the config I have so far: https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/268 ;)

[16:20:49] <kezabelle> as I say, I've not deep-dived on it hard yet, but hey ho, got nothing else to do ;)
[16:22:43] <serafeim> i've played a bit with intercooler js and tried to integrate it with django : https://github.com/spapas/django-modernize however i concluded that, especially concerning the form handling it ain't worth it
[16:22:52] <serafeim> it's way too complex and too much work
[16:23:14] <serafeim> for cases like pagination/filtering it's ok. but for forms it breaks down
[16:31:09] <kezabelle> yeah it's not perfect if you want to do things like per-field validation feedback
[16:32:12] <kezabelle> IDK that htmx is going to be any better, though.

[16:36:55] <kezabelle> I genuinely don't know what makes it better than intercooler. it's basically the same (as you might expect, given it's the same author)
[16:37:23] <serafeim> me neither :) but i haven't played with htmx
[16:37:42] <kezabelle> literally doesn't seem to say anywhere what makes it better than IC, other than it being essentially v2 with a different brand name.
[16:40:40] <serafeim> yes you are right about that
