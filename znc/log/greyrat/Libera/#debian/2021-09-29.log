[01:26:46] <sney> if the packages are from deb.sury.org's buster section they are perfectly fine quality, from the same person who maintains the php packages in stable
[01:26:52] <sussudio> this is offtopic for this channel _and_ debian-next.
[01:27:13] <sney> sometimes you have to deal with a php application that requires a super new php version, and you only have buster instances, whatever, it's a pretty normal use case
[01:27:14] <sussudio> why do people do this to themselves
[01:27:32] <sney> but an apache admin not being able to figure out how to disable a module and enable another module is a bit of an edge case
[01:28:16] <sney> I thought the whole a2enmod/a2dismod workflow was why people even used apache on debian in the first place :P

[01:38:15] <abff> sney: yeah that sounds right to me, make the root window whatever application you pick, right?

[01:39:11] <abff> build it yourself

[02:42:50] <James1138> Hello from Indiana and tricky question. Over all these years of Linux - has anyone found a way to remove protection from WMA files?  The reason I ask is I found some old USB with music from the days I still was into Windows XP but the music is WMA format.
[02:43:48] *** pong is now known as beaver
[02:44:32] <greycat> might be easier to find another source for these songs
[02:45:36] <sussudio> isn't WMA 128kbit or less anyway
[02:46:03] <[Kalisto]> nostalgia sounds better than kbits (?)
[02:46:16] <[Kalisto]> maybe he can't find those songs anywhere else
[02:46:48] <[Kalisto]> i have some old songs from early 2000 that are really hard to find
[02:47:03] <PMT> WMA can apparently do higher bitrates.

[02:49:51] <sussudio> so maybe not 'protected', but just broken.
[02:50:29] <PMT> that highly depends. i've certainly had friends whose usb sticks have turned out to be toast. i've also found USB sticks from when 32 MB was a lot where all the files were intact (and I knew, because I had other copies)

[02:56:05] <sussudio> i wonder if that st-251 still works...
[02:59:25] <gartt> Just gave debian a shot on an older Thinkpad, and am getting the "rtnetlink answers: file exists interface" error when trying to bring up my wifi card. Tried following advice on debian forums, serverfaultbripi4
[03:00:06] <sney> hello from an older thinkpad with working wifi, do you have the correct firmware package installed?
[03:00:21] <gartt> and a few others, but I'm not making any progress - same error. Is there any good resource for this? I'm on a lightweight WM, LXDE I believe

[03:00:48] <gartt> sney: I used the installation DVD for Debian 11, so I imagine it's on there. It's been about 10 years since I touched debian :)
[03:01:21] <greycat> !firmware images
[03:01:21] <dpkg> There are <live> system and <netinst> and DVD images containing non-free Debian <firmware> packages available from https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/ The images are "unofficial" because "official Debian" includes only 100% free software. They are otherwise identical to the normal installer images and prepared by the same Debian Developers. See <check iso>.
[03:02:29] <sney> gartt: as this wall of text suggests, firmware is only distributed on some installers. if your iso filename began with 'debian', you didn't have it.
[03:02:50] <sney> what wifi controller do you have? intel?

[03:05:46] <sney> ok. install the firmware-iwlwifi package from non-free and reboot, it should work then.

[03:06:24] <dpkg> Edit /etc/apt/sources.list, ensure that the two main Debian mirror lines end with "main contrib non-free" rather than just "main", then «apt-get update».  But bear in mind that you'll be installing <non-free> software.  These may have onerous terms; check the licenses.  See also <sources.list>.
[03:06:58] <gartt> sney: Thank you kindly. I'm usually better at RTFM, but have the old Thinkpad next to me in a less than optimal setting :)

[09:09:56] <PMT> tp43_: bullseye dropped basically every python2 package variant (which were named python-FOO), in favor of only the python3 variants where present (which would be python3-FOO). If the software you're using has decided it relies specifically on the Python 2 version, you could keep using buster for now, complain to the software vendor to fix it, change the dependencies and rebuild the packaging yourself
[09:10:02] <PMT> (presuming it's open source; though if it actually depends on internal Python2 code, this could get really messy fast...)
[09:10:30] <PMT> But Python2's deprecation has been a thing for quite some time at this point.

[15:02:39] <Khepra> and that's totally beside the point here
[15:03:33] <shtrb> There is a good chance that it would be easier to work over chromium from flatpak (but chromium is such a project that they just switched to snap in the first place)
[15:04:00] <Khepra> no there isn't, for the same reason canonical dropped chromium maintainership in favor of the snap
[15:04:25] <vipulogmx_> alkisg: yes
[15:04:26] <shtrb> There had been claims that maintaining chrumium in apt was too much work
[15:04:31] <Khepra> flatpaks don't do anything conceptually different from snaps. there's no hidden magick that would facilitate chromium .deb
[15:04:55] <vipulogmx_> alkisg: actually it will be created but the user and then installed but the user.
[15:05:02] <Khepra> it's too much work because you have to make it coexist within the stable environment. the very thing y'all want to do with this fictional snap/flatpak -to-deb converter

[15:06:51] <alkisg> Got it. I've heard about guix but I haven't tested it yet
[15:07:01] <jelly> is guix like nix?
[15:07:13] * jelly never heard of guix
[15:07:18] <vipulogmx_> guix is libre version of nix
[15:07:22] <Khepra> and you end up having the same thing as with flatpak, just not as isolated. you get libs all over the filesystem instead of confined within a directory or squashfs ball
[15:07:30] <vipulogmx_> Everything is libre only in guix
[15:07:48] <Khepra> so you took the worst of flatpak by removing the best of flatpak.
[15:08:02] <alkisg> But, the libs are separately updated and kept up to date, instead of waiting for the snap developer to update due to security issues in his libs
[15:08:36] <Khepra> and wait, you confuzzled me with guix.... with G....   I meant GoboLinux, not guix.
[15:09:23] <Khepra> alkisg: let me translate what you said:   the libs are separately updated BY SOMEONE and kept up to date BY SOMEONE instead of waiting for the SOMEONE to update the snap....
[15:09:26] <Khepra> see the pattern here? :)
[15:10:03] <Khepra> you've effectively replaced one SOMEONE by another SOMEONE, but that's still someone ELSE who'd have to do all that work.
[15:11:11] <alkisg> As upstream, I consider providing an appstream.xml and all the dependencies my work. But distributions currently can't use that info to autogenerate packages
[15:11:14] <shtrb> you could just create some mechanism that could take explicit versions , lets call it PKG or ebuilds
[15:11:29] <Khepra> and look at this one:   chromium snap IS UP TO DATE. chromium deb, the one you think is superior beacause "someone would keep it up to date"   is terribly OUT of date, insecure, vulnerable.

[17:43:46] <Khepra> mitre's holding a lid on that one
[17:44:35] <xx> I know I'm preaching to the choir in here, but nobody should have been using debian-packaged chromium for at least the last half a year
[17:45:11] <Khepra> and more, the situation with chromium is dating to 2019 if not earlier
[17:45:33] <xx> indeed
[17:46:06] <jelly> we were in a similar situation with firefox, before
[17:46:21] <xx> it's very surprising, I can build chromium overnight (takes ~8 hours here) on a low-spec machine, so debian should be able to do the same
[17:46:53] <jelly> debian wants to build for stable using only versions of software that are also in stable
[17:47:21] <shtrb> jelly, debian packaged firefox has CVE ?
[17:47:25] <themill> it's not CPU cycles that are the limit here
[17:47:25] <jelly> it is not good enough to merely have a build that _works_ on stable but has to be built on unstable or testing
[17:47:42] <jelly> shtrb, past tense, a couple years back
[17:47:45] <xx> shtrb: it did before, because the esr version took close to a month to get in

[17:49:27] <jelly> it's not any more or any less unsafe than mozilla's builds
[17:49:32] <xx> but it very likely will be in a few weeks, because the esr version will not get into debian on time

[17:49:55] <xx> jelly: past experience

[17:50:20] <xx> whenever a new big esr version update was released, it took close to or over a month to get into stable
[17:51:18] <jelly> that doesn't mean the old one had known vulns.

[21:02:51] <neilthereildeil> if i want to rename the volume group in which my / partition exists, would i just run vgrename, or would i need to update anything else?
[21:03:11] <sney> windows - and thus smb/cifs - uses "access denied" as a catchall error for a lot of different things. so it's probably not even a permissions issue.

[21:10:46] <sney> and the share is your home directory, right? so it's already owned by that user and has the usual perms
[21:11:01] <sney> maybe stop the samba daemon and start it again, in case it's caching something weird
