[02:43:46] <programmerq> moldorcoder7: links are deprecated and have been for years. you do not need to use them. Are you trying to do volumes_from on an externally managed container? (external to your compose file?)
[02:44:03] <programmerq> normally, you'd just refer to the volumes by name directly rather than deal with the volumes_from stuff.
[02:44:44] <programmerq> the "data container" pattern is also very outdated. Ever since named volumes were introduced, it was completely unnecessary and just a lot of extra convoluted pain
[02:45:03] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, i used volumes_from and provided service name insteas of container name and it worked
[02:45:20] <moldorcoder7> i know it is outdated but i dont have a choice in this case
[02:45:34] <moldorcoder7> i need to follow upstram image that makes it mandatory
[02:45:50] <programmerq> yup, that'll do the trick. compose files refer to the compose idea of services rather than refer to a container name.
[02:46:11] <programmerq> an upstream image won't know nor care whether you use the data container pattern or a named volume, especially if you're firing it up inside a compose file.
[02:46:23] <programmerq> all the running container will see is a directory at the specified location
[02:47:32] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, besides the fact that team wont allow to change the model,  the issue here is 2 things from what i saw
[02:48:16] <programmerq> a team with a policy is different from an image somehow needing the old pattern
[02:48:19] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, 1 the data container and the main container use the dame base image and the exposed /srv volume contains files that comes from the original image and also need some persistent configuration
[02:48:41] <moldorcoder7> that could be worked around by creating a temp container , then copy the file locally ....
[02:49:03] <moldorcoder7> but 2, the services are not running as root and this ensure the permissions
[02:49:16] <programmerq> is the /srv volume in the "main" container empty?
[02:49:18] <moldorcoder7> dunno if docker provide any workaround for the second case
[02:49:23] <moldorcoder7> no
[02:49:43] <moldorcoder7> it is a mix of data coming from the base image and persistent file 
[02:50:18] <moldorcoder7> but that could be extracted somehow, still the user permissions seems more problematics
[02:50:40] <moldorcoder7> so in this case data-container seems the only use case where it makes sense to keep it i guess
[02:54:54] <programmerq> docker has a volume initialization thing where it copies anything in the image at the location of a volume (anonymous or named) to the brand new volume (including permissions) when it runs.
[02:55:20] <programmerq> so unless you are actually launching the data container first, and letting it run to do a copy/chown/etc, then you don't need the data container pattern.
[02:55:53] <programmerq> and even if you did want to use a separate container to initialize a volume, you could still use a named volume and not deal with the volumes_from stuff to point to a container that points to an anonymous volume.

[03:06:35] <programmerq> so if that "data container" initializes the location you need, then yes-- it'd need to come up first and do that, and you can influence which service compose makes comes up first with depends_on. so you can still use these together, but instead of links and volumes_from you'd just use a named volume and depends_on
[03:06:38] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, the trick for this to work is the VOLUME /srv/app ?
[03:07:11] <moldorcoder7> or it is native
[03:07:37] <programmerq> technically, you don't need VOLUME at all
[03:08:13] <programmerq> but if there's a VOLUME instruction for that location at all, including in the base image, then that location will only have whatever is there in the build process up until the time VOLUME was used.
[03:08:34] <programmerq> take out the VOLUME instruction in my example and rerun (make sure you also delete the named volume when you try it)
[03:08:46] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, nice , i didnt know that 
[03:08:57] <moldorcoder7> so yeah you where right then , not needed :)
[03:09:16] <programmerq> I don't think I've seen anyone mention the data container pattern in over a year, lol.
[03:09:53] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, wrong you toldme it is obsolete a few month ago :)
[03:10:50] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, percona still use it :(

[13:19:34] <ryu`> I have a VM on proxmox. Currently this VM has 1 network interface which resides in VLAN 40. Now, I use a container in this VM and i can access the resources on VLAN 40; 192.168.40.100:443 (443 is mapped). What do I do, if I want to have another container running on this host; but I would like the container to be accessible on VLAN 100. How do i come about this; do i add another interface on the VM, with tagged VLAN 100 traffic -- and then configure
[13:19:34] <ryu`>  the container to use this interface? Is this how you guys do it? Or do you just spin up another VM to differentiate the different VLAN networks. ..

[15:16:01] <ryu`> wez : proxmox is just an hypervisor- the main issue is how i can make traffic from one container go out on a different vlan
[15:16:35] <ryu`> and what best practies are
[15:17:34] <tabakhase> ryu` either will do - your docker-host "is just a router with iptables"
[15:18:33] <ryu`> tabakhase : for now i have several VMS, with different containers dependent on which VLAN they shall reside in
[15:18:51] <ryu`> i think i want just 1 VM, and then the containers in there
[15:19:09] <ryu`> just have not figured out how to do it
[15:19:17] <ryu`> to segregate them
[15:19:33] <tabakhase> ryu` guess only note is that "routing" is a different kinda deal than "access"
[15:21:13] <ryu`> think i found an answer here in the comments section; https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/f0cuij/container_in_vlans/

[15:24:36] <luva> I have a several interfaces on my vps. I have a vpn set up in them. How is it possible to forward ports so that only the ips from one of them can access containers
[15:25:40] <luva> I dont want some of my containers to be publicly available, but only through the vpn
[15:27:40] <tabakhase> ryu` that dude seems to be specifically include routing ("I wan't to restrict my container to 1 VLAN so I can control network traffic with my firewall.") - in this case just using seperate vms is a loooot simpler
[15:28:51] *** Quits: cewood (~cewood@ip5b417897.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:29:29] <tabakhase> ryu` if were just talking access - as in let clients from vlan1-10.1.2.3/24 access one webserver, clients from vlan30-192.168.1.0/24 another - just adding both on the same host and using the explicit IP in the -p is perfectly fine
[15:30:24] <luva> does that also apply to my question ? If I have several interfaces e.g. eth0 with IP 1 and vpn0 with IP 2 , i Can use -p IP2:port:port to have only this interface access to the container?
[15:34:09] <ryu`> to be specific of what i want to achive is that i want to have 1 host on VLAN 200 (servers - for example; 192.168.200.100). this is easy through proxmox and tagged vlan interface. on this server, i want for example to have a 'nging reverse proxy manager' container utilizing the VLAN 100 (DMZ). and then i would want to have an container using for example VLAN 30 (VPN traffic). so instead of using 3 VMs with each 1 container, is it possible to achieve
[15:34:09] <ryu`>  this with 1 VM? i should not be able to do 192.168.200.100:81 to access the nginx reverse proxy manager, but rather have to use 192.168.100.20:81 -- and i do not want to be able to access for example a qbittorrent container on the .200.100 interface, but only through 30.40:8443
[15:35:54] <ryu`> is the solution to use 1 VM and attach three network interfaces to this server? and how to restrict the host VM not using the VLAN 100 / VLAN 30 for its own traffic, but have it only utilizing the 200 VLAN
[15:36:51] <ryu`> or should i just use two ore more different VMs alltogether and seperate the traffiic at that level instead :)

[18:26:24] <tabakhase> (what has a fairly decent readme too)
[18:27:21] <tabakhase> further, no clue where you pull that url from - but generally you mount or copy whatever you want to serve to /usr/share/nginx/html and be done with it :D
[18:32:27] <faLUKE> hey; I executed "docker system prune -a" but there is still something cached somewhere. how could I fix it?

[21:18:23] <arlion> Hey, i have an interesting problem. Recently our cloud went dark and the team and I are responsible for restoring services. One VM on a self hosted cloud platform is currently reporting `Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: error obtaining controller instance: failed to get bridge network configurations from store: error while populating kmap: invalid database`. 
[21:19:05] <arlion> Mind you, yes, there was data loss to the cloud platform this server was hosted on. I wrote a script that re-installed every package from upstream repos. So everything should be like a fresh install.
[21:19:20] <arlion> I have `rm -rf /var/lib/docker/network/files/*`

[21:38:04] <programmerq> olle: that 172.18.0.1 looks like the gateway ip for a particular docker network. it isn't guaranteed to always be the same because any given docker network can have any subnet.
