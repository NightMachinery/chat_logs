[00:21:29] <mjlbach[m]> I removed it, happy to do a Q&A
[00:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> 1. it was broken
[00:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> 2. it got in the way of using the system package manager
[00:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> 3. philosophically, neovim (core) should not manage system packages

I've got most stuff setup as I want them but there's one big thing that irks be a little bit... In Emacs I used ivy and I could easy call a "find file" command which would open a file picker based on the path of the current buffer. If typing a file that doesn't exist it is created.
[00:47:57] <linusmarton[m]> Is there something like this for (neo)vim? It's a bit annoying to have to do :e some/long/path/new.file or :e %:h/new.file

[00:48:49] <gpanders[m]1> linusmarton: look for a plugin called telescope
[00:49:00] <linusmarton[m]> I am using Telescope :)
[00:49:09] <linusmarton[m]> I can achieve that somehow?
[00:49:50] <ii14[m]> yeah, you can, if I can figure out how to paste code here

[00:50:24] <linusmarton[m]> ```
[00:50:31] <linusmarton[m]>  * ```
[00:50:31] <linusmarton[m]> I think so

[00:51:06] <ii14[m]>   let d = expand('%:h')
[00:51:06] <ii14[m]>   return (d ==# '' ? './' : d..'/')
[00:51:06] <ii14[m]> endfunction
[00:51:11] <ii14[m]> I have a function like that
[00:51:16] <ii14[m]> it returns the path to the buffer
[00:51:25] <ii14[m]> then you can just give it to whatever
[00:51:44] <ii14[m]> `nno <silent><expr> <leader>F ':Files '.Bufdir()."\<CR>"`
[00:51:59] <ii14[m]> this is for fzf for example
[00:52:58] <linusmarton[m]> gpanders[m]1: That's just a fuzzy finder of all files? Let's say pwd=.config/neovim. I have `.config/neovim/after/ftplugin/ruby.vim open in a buffer. Now I want to create a new file called `elixir.vim` in the same folder as `ruby.vim`. How do I achieve that with `:Telescope find_files`?
[00:53:17] <phaazon[m]> I don’t think telescope does as many things as ivy / vertico linusmarton 
[00:53:17] <windwp[m]> you need to create a new mapping on telescope to do that 
[00:53:19] <linusmarton[m]> s///
[00:53:47] <gpanders[m]1> linusmarton: yes, sorry I misread your question
[00:54:02] <linusmarton[m]> gpanders[m]1: No worries :) I really appreciate the help!
[00:54:13] <windwp[m]> you can override a cr key or create a new mapping
[00:54:20] <gpanders[m]1> I use this: `nnoremap <Space>e :e %:p:h/<Tab>`
[00:54:48] <gpanders[m]1> so e.g. pressing `<Space>e` prepopulates `:e /path/to/current/dir/` and then I can just type a new file name or press `<Tab>` again to complete existing files
[00:55:21] <gpanders[m]1> it's low-tech as it just uses the standard command line, not a picker window or anything
[00:55:46] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: going from `ivy`, you will find `telescope` as a downgrade (and it’s worse with `vertico`), so don’t expect too much 🙂

[01:04:46] <phaazon[m]> ah, on IRC
[01:04:58] <linusmarton[m]> phaazon[m]: No, nothing. evil mode is great :) It's just that sometimes it's annoying to not know the native bindings... And I don't really want to learn them (native Emacs bindings I mean)... But it's nothing major tbh.
[01:05:07] <armin> phaazon[m]: riot/element/matrix/whateveritscalledtoday users have that, yea.
[01:05:26] <gpanders[m]1> phaazon[m]: I gave Emacs an honest try but just couldn't grok it I guess. I like (neo)vim + tmux because I love being fully in the shell

[01:05:50] <phaazon[m]> gpanders: yeah, me too
[01:05:50] <linusmarton[m]> linusmarton[m]: As I said, it's mostly that emacs feels a bit clunky at times. lsp is slow, autocomplete etc is slow....
[01:05:55] <phaazon[m]> but using emacs a lot lately showed me a different perspective
[01:05:57] <armin> i gave emacs an honest try, too. i failed multiple times. it's just nothing i could get used to. full stop.
[01:05:58] <gpanders[m]1> I also spent so much time fiddling with plugins and plugin configuration, even more than I do with (neo)vim
[01:06:02] <phaazon[m]> i.e. dropping my shell (because emacs becomes a shell now)
[01:06:16] <phaazon[m]> it gives a… better UI to do things you can do in a terminal, but also with other tools
[01:06:30] <bfredl> armin: one can set up a mapping from matrix to proper libera nick, that requires typing a few text commands to a bot tho (the horror!)
[01:06:35] <armin> i use zsh currently, but it could well be that i find something better at some point ;-)
[01:06:44] <maverun[m]> confession: i dont use tmux, i find them troublesome
[01:06:45] <linusmarton[m]> And emacs will just rollover and die if you accidentally paste a line that is too long.
[01:06:46] <phaazon[m]> so today things trigger me a lot, like unicode character to draw borders, for instance 😀

[01:07:58] <armin> seriously, i gave emacs a try, it totally doesn't work with the way i think.
[01:07:59] <windwp[m]> not a good solution but it work
[01:08:00] <mjlbach[m]> I like matrix
[01:08:11] <bfredl> armin: yes we use element spaces as a slightly functional but open FOSS discord guild like thing :)

[01:08:23] <armin> mjlbach[m]: that's good for you, use it. i just consider it inherently broken and wait for something new.
[01:08:32] <phaazon[m]> windwp[m]: …
[01:08:39] <linusmarton[m]> windwp[m]: Yeah sure :) I mostly wanted to know if any nice plugin existed that could do something similar. I'll see if I can jjust come up with some custom keybindings instead.
[01:08:51] <mjlbach[m]> armin: inherently broken is a little underspecified
[01:08:57] <bfredl> a nice function with the matrix-irc bridge is that I can just paste a big text dump, and my IRC frens get a pastbin-like link for free :)

[01:09:35] <armin> mjlbach[m]: it's conceptually broken. using a distributed database for a chat protocol may come to mind at first, but in the end will turn out as a pretty terrible idea. matrix shows this at its best.
[01:09:37] <ii14[m]> linusmarton[m]: vim has problems with handling long lines too
[01:09:38] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: I do that at work
[01:09:48] <ii14[m]> or not really handling, it's just slow
[01:10:24] <mjlbach[m]> armin: I just don’t see evidence why the implementation details of federation matters, matrix can also operate entirely peer to peer
[01:10:28] <phaazon[m]> the only problem I have with emacs today is when using the equivalent of `wrap` (especially in `org-mode`) and then calling `avy`… it takes sometimes up to 5s to hint the visible part of the buffer
[01:10:37] <phaazon[m]> given the fact that I know very well how Hop performs
[01:10:41] <phaazon[m]> it makes me suuuuuuuuuuuuuper cringe 😀
[01:10:49] <armin> mjlbach[m]: it's incredibly slow, breaks like 50% times when you want to send something simple as an image, yada yada. i'm not a fan of it, even though i use it because it works on ALL the operating systems, iOS and android included, and the mobile applications are just great.

[01:13:59] <armin> phaazon[m]: that's a terminal multiplexer actually, yes.
[01:14:04] <phaazon[m]> bfredl: what
[01:14:04] <armin> bfredl: yes.
[01:14:23] <bfredl> phaazon: why do you need sessions and panes when tmux already has that?
[01:14:28] <maverun[m]> panes? those window? i hardly need them, but when i do, terminal have that support xD
[01:14:31] <phaazon[m]> I have ~12 / 15 sessions in my tmux, with several « tabs » (windows) each, and several panes
[01:14:34] <windwp[m]> maverun[m]: you will lost too many funny.
[01:14:40] <armin> # Set the prefix to ^A.
[01:14:40] <armin> unbind C-b
[01:14:40] <armin> set -g prefix ^A
[01:14:40] <armin> bind a send-prefix
[01:14:41] <armin> set -g prefix ^a
[01:14:52] <phaazon[m]> maverun: panes is tmux’ name for splits
[01:14:55] <armin> decades of using screen have brought me to this. i can't help it...
[01:14:55] <linusmarton[m]> <phaazon[m]> "linusmarton: I do that at work" <- Haha ok. Maybe it's better now. I haven't dared to paste long lines in a while.
[01:15:12] <maverun[m]> phaazon[m]: terminal can do it as well :)
[01:15:19] <armin> muscle-memory is one hell of a drug.
[01:15:24] <phaazon[m]> not « really »
[01:15:25] <phaazon[m]> I use kitty
[01:15:30] <phaazon[m]> it lacks a bunch of features
[01:15:36] <armin> kitty is fine, be sure to look at alacritty and foot, too.
[01:15:38] <phaazon[m]> such as session persistence and sessions in the first place
[01:15:48] <phaazon[m]> alacritty doesn’t have half the features of kitty 😀
[01:15:54] <armin> that's nothing a terminal emulator should do.
[01:16:09] <armin> that's true, but kitty isn't half at fast as alacritty is.
[01:16:13] <phaazon[m]> eh I think it should.
[01:16:22] <armin> but why? it's a terminal emulator.
[01:16:27] <maverun[m]> well for you, you might need them i guess
[01:16:27] <maverun[m]> for me i am fine with the way i have right now, i hardly need anymore than what i need, maybe in future when i but at this moment i am fine i guess
[01:16:33] <maverun[m]> idk what i need so many session for
[01:16:36] <phaazon[m]> it’s way smarter to have that kind of things implemented by the terminal rather than using a software multiplexer reimplementing a whole terminal inside your terminal
[01:16:39] <phaazon[m]> but opinions diverge
[01:16:40] <armin> just use tmux.
[01:16:44] <bfredl> I use a tmux per workhorse computer at work, with a lot of windows in each. I prefer to do editing locally and wire up scp tho
[01:16:54] <gpanders[m]1> phaazon[m]: how would a terminal program implement session persistence on a remote server?
[01:17:01] <armin> tmux attach and everything is where you want it to be. that's out of scope of a terminal emulator.
[01:17:13] <phaazon[m]> not really
[01:17:26] <phaazon[m]> a terminal emulator (what you type in) could be a simple client
[01:17:29] <linusmarton[m]> armin: Isn't kitty faster than alacritty? Or at least on par... (Not that it really matters)
[01:17:34] <phaazon[m]> and you could have your `termd` run in the background
[01:17:38] <phaazon[m]> as a systemd unit
[01:17:38] <phaazon[m]> or whatever
[01:17:41] <armin> you really need to separate scope here, which field do you want to handle here?
[01:17:57] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: nah
[01:17:58] <armin> linusmarton[m]: in my personal tests? absolutely not, no.
[01:18:02] <phaazon[m]> they’re on par
[01:18:05] <armin> yea
[01:18:06] <phaazon[m]> it depends actually
[01:18:08] <armin> both are great.
[01:18:11] <phaazon[m]> inside tmux, kitty is much faster
[01:18:11] <sb[m]1> I'm "still" using screen for that... is tmux better?
[01:18:12] <armin> yup
[01:18:17] <phaazon[m]> outside of it, alacritty is slightly faster
[01:18:20] <sb[m]1> or is that something different?
[01:18:31] <UndeadLeech> If you have to ask which terminal is faster, chances are it doesn't matter for you.
[01:18:41] <armin> sb[m]1: depends. these programs, both of them, are ULTRA tied to your muscle memory. that's what it's like.
[01:18:42] <linusmarton[m]> Haha it definitely doesn't matter
[01:19:03] <linusmarton[m]> linusmarton[m]: Especially since they are both very fast :)
[01:19:21] <armin> sb[m]1: i, personally, do use the snippet i pasted above, only because i was using screen for over 10 years, and this gave me a smooth transition into tmux.
[01:19:22] <UndeadLeech> Plenty of people are fine with XTerm and that's terribly slow.
[01:19:28] <sb[m]1> armin: Yes, I am using screen for like 20 years :) But my muscle memory can adapt easily... I was just wondering because I'm hearing about tmux a lot recently, and never heard about screen the last time
[01:19:31] <armin> sb[m]1: technically, yes, tmux is much much much better.
[01:19:32] <phaazon[m]> UndeadLeech: I’m sure you’d pop up
[01:19:46] <armin> sb[m]1: yeah use my tmux.conf then
[01:19:48] <maverun[m]> where sunjon when we need him
[01:19:53] <UndeadLeech> phaazon[m]: Yeah just bully me long enough and eventually I'll show up. :(
[01:20:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> always around.
[01:20:05] <phaazon[m]> I have IRC for that
[01:20:14] <armin> sb[m]1: https://nuke.m2m.pm/tmux.conf <- this WILL get you going. if not, don't hesitate to /query me.
[01:20:15] <sb[m]1> armin: Can you sum up why that is so?
[01:20:28] <armin> just try. if you have ANY question, /msg me.
[01:20:42] <phaazon[m]> but UndeadLeech , we disagree on probably everything, but IIRC, you agree with me that tmux is an anti-pattern, right?
[01:20:57] <phaazon[m]> (and you use your TWM for that anyway, minus all the sessions features of tmux)
[01:21:06] <UndeadLeech> Tmux is a pragmatic solution to a lot of individual problems that are better solved in different ways (imo).
[01:21:16] <phaazon[m]> agreed
[01:21:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> ^
[01:21:27] <gpanders[m]1> -1
[01:21:29] <gpanders[m]1> disagreed
[01:21:37] <gpanders[m]1> alternative solutions are subpar
[01:22:00] <phaazon[m]> gpanders: kitty’s tabs, even though I really dislike them, are way faster than using tmux.
[01:22:03] <phaazon[m]> and it makes sense
[01:22:10] <maverun[m]> tools is a tools, find one that suit you best, if tmux work for you, that great
[01:22:11] <phaazon[m]> since tmux has to re-implement a terminal
[01:22:29] <maverun[m]> oh that remind me, sunjon (Senghan Bright) you mention scrollback buffer, you put them into neovim right?
[01:22:33] <linusmarton[m]> maverun[m]: No, we need to fight on the internet about them!
[01:22:49] <gpanders[m]1> phaazon[m]: what is faster? opening a new tab vs a new window/pane? I have never noticed any slowness here
[01:22:54] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: are you used to `projectile`? 🙂
[01:22:57] <gpanders[m]1> kitty loses all of its state the second it's closed
[01:23:07] <gpanders[m]1> and I can't use kitty on a remote server with ssh
[01:23:08] <linusmarton[m]> phaazon[m]: Yes. It's great :)
[01:23:10] <bfredl> tmux is good to have when working over ssh. maybe in 20 years I could use kitty-protocol-over-ssh, for now, tmux will do :)
[01:23:11] <armin> sb[m]1: i just personally messaged you, if you have ANY question, please ask.
[01:23:15] <phaazon[m]> gpanders: no, working in tabbed kitty vs. working in tabbed tmux
[01:23:23] <armin> tmux is like, the shit.
[01:23:28] <armin> i couldn't live without it.
[01:23:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> gpanders:matrix.org: there's interesting WIP regarding rsync/remote SSH going on with kitty
[01:23:33] <gpanders[m]1> fwiw I do use tabs in kitty, but I use it in conjunction with tmux
[01:23:36] <gpanders[m]1> armin: agreed
[01:23:37] <armin> well, i could, if i was allowed to use screen.
[01:23:39] <phaazon[m]> same thing with splits
[01:23:57] <gpanders[m]1> the GUI terminal emulator is just the on-screen interface
[01:23:59] <phaazon[m]> try to create splits so that you have one in the middle of your tmux window, and look at scrollback speed; try the same in kitty, and cry over tmux.
[01:24:01] <gpanders[m]1> tmux implements the real goods
[01:24:04] <gpanders[m]1> and is what I care about
[01:24:18] <gpanders[m]1> its agnostic to the actual terminal emulator program
[01:24:20] <linusmarton[m]> linusmarton[m]: phaazon: why? :D
[01:24:20] <gpanders[m]1> it works everywhere
[01:24:21] <gpanders[m]1> its highly configurable
[01:24:22] <bfredl> vim mode in tmux scrollback is the best, tho
[01:24:29] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: because I think stuff like `projectile` _is_ the way to go 
[01:24:38] <phaazon[m]> while `tmux` is the anti-way to go 😀
[01:24:44] *** Quits: jstein (~jstein@gentoo/developer/jstein) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:24:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> bfredl:matrix.org: actual nvim in kitty scrollback is better.
[01:24:56] <bfredl> I don't "smooth scroll" in a tmux buffer, I search for what I need :)
[01:25:11] <linusmarton[m]> phaazon[m]: I don't get it... What does tmux and projectile have to do with each other? :D
[01:25:20] <maverun[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: can i ask you how do that? i have that problem right now
[01:25:25] <bfredl> @sunjon differerent usecase altogheter
[01:25:33] <phaazon[m]> linusmarton: lots of people (me included) use tmux’ sessions to encode the concept of workspace
[01:25:39] <phaazon[m]> you can also use tmux window, too
[01:25:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> bfredl:matrix.org: aren't they both just to seach/copy-from scrollback?
[01:26:47] <bfredl> @sunjon if one use nvim to manage the scrollback buffer, then kitty scrollback is irrelevant. so what you are suggesting doesn't apply to my usecase.
[01:27:03] <Mathias[m]> and here I thought https://www.brain-dump.org/projects/abduco/ was the way to go 
[01:28:08] <bfredl> nvim scrollback buffers are missing text-reflow unfortunately, I rely on that a lot for my remote tmux sessions..
[01:28:24] <UndeadLeech> Text reflow is a mess anyway.
[01:28:34] <windwp[m]> maverun[m]: i think you can use mouse :(
[01:30:09] <maverun[m]> mouse bad
[01:31:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> hmm. kitty seems to have some visual-select mode going on in the nightly too

[01:32:10] <phaazon[m]> I love kitty’s hints
[01:32:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> no idea, not seen it in action. just reading the commits
[01:32:18] <bfredl> I like text reflow to at least work for simple text output (of which my python scripts does a lot :)

[01:32:44] <fugkco> Hey all, question, is there a reason the neovim/stable ppa hasn't been updated with 0.5.0?
[01:32:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the latter is some of the rsync work; again, not tried it, but it looks really interesting
[01:32:52] <UndeadLeech> Oh that could mean literally anything.

[01:32:56] <PeterLi[m]> sup
[01:32:59] <phaazon[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): it’s probably already existing no?
[01:33:03] <phaazon[m]> I guesss it’s the hint thing
[01:33:10] <phaazon[m]> I’m using it for URLs, hashes, words, and files
[01:33:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> wasn't hints a separate script/kitten?
[01:33:38] <phaazon[m]> it ships with it so I don’t know
[01:33:45] <phaazon[m]> I never really noticed whether it was a kitten
[01:34:35] <windwp[m]> no i don't need nightly more i happy with tmux
[01:35:30] <phaazon[m]> UndeadLeech can we have the macOS logo updated please thanks
[01:35:36] <UndeadLeech> lol
[01:35:44] <UndeadLeech> The most important of all features.
[01:35:56] <armin> kitty has some features that sets it apart from other terminal emulators, yes, absolutely, and if one of these fits your workflow, juse use kitty.
[01:36:01] <UndeadLeech> Actually there's a new major macos version, isn't there? Sounds like it's time for a redesign.
[01:36:14] <phaazon[m]> wait, again?

[01:36:31] <UndeadLeech> I forgot the name, but I updated last thursday before the weekend.
[01:36:43] * phaazon[m] shoots armin 
[01:36:47] <armin> hi.
[01:36:49] <UndeadLeech> The wallpaper's pink now.
[01:36:52] <phaazon[m]> bye.
[01:36:55] <armin> :(
[01:37:04] <armin> <- dead
[01:37:26] <UndeadLeech> I know a guy that can help you with that.
[01:37:46] <mjlbach[m]> DeadLeech?
[01:38:03] <armin> yea still, on linux i use "foot" (read: foo terminal) since 2 weeks now, it's the greatest thing ever, super minimalistic, ultra lighweight, just incredibly fast.
[01:38:37] <phaazon[m]> foot?
[01:38:39] <mjlbach[m]> all of the modern terminals IMO feel pretty similar
[01:38:44] <armin> since we are on THAT topic: if a fast terminal emulator is what you're looking for, it's likely that all you want to do is speed up your shell initialization...
[01:38:45] <phaazon[m]> is it a suckless terminal?
[01:38:47] <mjlbach[m]> foot, wezterm, alacritty, kitty
[01:38:48] <UndeadLeech> Foot is the wayland-exclusive one.
[01:38:49] <armin> foot.
[01:38:52] <armin> no.
[01:38:56] <phaazon[m]> ah
[01:38:57] <mjlbach[m]> all great :) 
[01:39:00] <phaazon[m]> so I will not be able to use it
[01:39:02] <ii14[m]> I wonder, what does "fast" mean in terms of a terminal? not being written in electron?
[01:39:11] <armin> https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot
[01:39:15] <mjlbach[m]> ii14[m]: it is measurable 
[01:39:19] <phaazon[m]> ii14: being able to read text at 200 FPS really fast with the eyes moving like crazy
[01:39:23] <phaazon[m]> I know a guy who does that 
[01:39:28] <ii14[m]> but is it noticeable?
[01:39:29] <UndeadLeech> :)
[01:39:37] <armin> this thing here, it's INCREDIBLY great, the developers are ultra helpful, and it simply replaced alacritty/kitty for me
[01:39:38] <ii14[m]> to a human
[01:39:46] <phaazon[m]> 🙂
[01:39:51] <armin> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:40:02] <armin> (◣_◢)┌∩┐
[01:40:11] <UndeadLeech> I mean you can tell the difference, if you actually benefit from it is a different question.
[01:40:11] <phaazon[m]> armin: does it support hints and unicode input?
[01:40:13] <armin> Ⓐ
[01:40:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> ii14:matrix.org: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunjon/images/master/extmark-toy.gif
[01:40:17] <phaazon[m]> you said it was lightweight so probably not
[01:40:29] <armin> phaazon[m]: i don't know what hints are, but unicode, yes.
[01:40:32] <elianiva[m]> too bad foot cuts the double wide fancy glyphs
[01:40:46] <phaazon[m]> oh, maybe it would fix my ~lenny issue
[01:40:51] <UndeadLeech> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[01:40:59] <aphysically> I wonder if foot reports horizontal scrolling events
[01:41:07] <aphysically> I'll have to try it whenever I switch to wayland
[01:41:12] * aphysically on nvidia
[01:41:21] <UndeadLeech> aphysically: Do you know a terminal that does?
[01:41:23] <aphysically> pretty sure there's still some rough spots that need sorted
[01:41:32] <armin> it's an incredibly under-rated terminal emulator i think, if you use sway on wayland a no brainer - you definitely have to try that i think...
[01:41:34] <aphysically> UndeadLeech: someone claimed earlier that windows terminal does
[01:41:52] <aphysically> I don't have a way to check this though
[01:42:02] <UndeadLeech> Are codes 66/67 horizontal scrolling? I don't have any input devices that do that.
[01:42:13] <aphysically> my laptop does it
[01:42:16] <aphysically> (the trackpad)
[01:42:35] <phaazon[m]> some glyphs are completely cut in kitty ☹️
[01:42:36] <phaazon[m]> oh yeah, Wayland native, too bad
[01:42:38] <bew[m]> phaazon you know Wezterm ? It has a mux server for persistence (the sessions like tmux are not yet impl, waiting for someone to do it), written in Rust ❤️, full config in Lua, cross platform, precise font configs, I use it as my main term for a ~year on linux & windows, I love it, way more than kitty (which has way too much untyped python for my taste in its codebase...)
[01:42:42] *** PeterLi[m] is now known as peterino[m]
[01:42:51] <phaazon[m]> bew: yeah I tried it
[01:42:57] <phaazon[m]> I had issues with key remapping ☹️ so I gave it up
[01:43:00] <armin> UndeadLeech: isn't that scrollwheel left/right? (only *some* mice support that)
[01:43:07] <phaazon[m]> * I gave up on it
[01:43:08] <phaazon[m]> also, « full config Lua »
[01:43:09] <phaazon[m]> I ran away
[01:43:13] <UndeadLeech> armin: Yeah it is.
[01:43:13] <phaazon[m]> 😀
[01:43:17] <armin> UndeadLeech: ah
[01:43:18] <Mathias[m]> We're in a neovim channel and nobody asks if the terminal has a vi mode.  
[01:43:27] <mjlbach[m]> Mathias[m]: I forgot
[01:43:33] <armin> UndeadLeech: yeah your mouse needs to support that, like, mechanically
[01:43:43] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's no need. <current_terminal> does :]
[01:44:13] <bew[m]> phaazon[m]: oh right, forgot that you want json config ^^ but note that lua is used as a data language, you can't configure every part of the terminal, it's pretty static in the end
[01:44:15] <armin> all terminals suck. just use the one that somehow gets the job done for you.
[01:44:35] <mjlbach[m]> s/all terminals sucks/all terminals are great and I agree with the above
[01:44:45] <phaazon[m]> > lua used as a data language

[01:47:30] <dundargoc[m]> phaazon[m]: Jk i use terminal
[01:47:44] <armin> for me, personally, a terminal emulator is my primary window to the world. i'm hard at hearing since my birth. for me, a terminal emulator is a crucial part in my life to interact with other humans. it just needs to work.
[01:48:19] <ii14[m]> yeah, terminal and web browser are basically the only two gui applications i use
[01:48:35] <armin> ii14[m]: there's totally nothing wrong with that.
[01:48:47] <ii14[m]> forgot about fucking ms teams
[01:48:51] <armin> ii14[m]: if you don't miss anything, why bother.
[01:48:56] <armin> oh fuck.
[01:48:58] <sb[m]1> ii14[m]: Aren't there modern web browsers for the terminal window? :D
[01:49:00] <armin> ms teams.
[01:49:01] <armin> fuck.
[01:49:12] <armin> i thought i would be safe from that crap in here.
[01:49:24] <maverun[m]> you guy want fastest terminal? just use system one, uninstall gui all that shit, TUI is only a way to go
[01:49:24] <maverun[m]> browser? lynx then
[01:49:24] <armin> damnit.
[01:49:36] <phaazon[m]> maverun: bloody hell
[01:49:38] <armin> maverun[m]: hm, no?

[01:50:26] <jumper[m]> Putty/Getty are quite horrible actually
[01:50:27] <armin> TUI is love, TUI is life. the last thing to die is TUI.
[01:50:30] <ii14[m]> sb: I think there is a chromium that just renders to terminal, but what's the point

[01:51:13] <YorickPeterse[m]> Today I found the best kind of telescope bug: one where both the documentation and code are wrong about what actually happens

[01:51:34] <armin> elianiva[m]: well these things are nice to have installed, if you feel adventurous, but that's NOTHING you should use on a daily basis, no.
[01:51:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> this terminal topic is 7/10 poop/circlejerk
[01:51:47] <sb[m]1> ii14[m]: I was socialized at times where people said "lynx is the fastest web browser", I'd say lynx is the slowest web browsers nowadays ;D (No, there was no point... I just wanted to say that web browser and terminal emulator is not mutual exclusive)
[01:51:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/issues/1409: who's right, the documentation or the code? how about neither lol
[01:51:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's lacking any actual interesting content
[01:51:55] <mjlbach[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: I feel like reddit would benefit from a post about this
[01:52:07] <YorickPeterse[m]> mjlbach: how so?
[01:52:13] <armin> sunjonSenghanBri: no it isn't. a terminal emulator is a very crucial piece of software humans use to interact with the world. 
[01:52:16] <mjlbach[m]> (it's a joke)
[01:52:28] <sunjonSenghanBri> armin:libera.chat: I assure you it is

[01:53:26] *** Joins: Guest53 (~Guest53@152.67.207.99)
[01:53:38] <armin> seriously, terminal emulators are probably the most under-rated piece of software, in general. they open a whole new world to the user, and that's especially important to visually impaired people.
[01:53:44] <ii14[m]> I believe links2 had a cool, minimalist gui mode
[01:53:58] <armin> links2/w3m/lynx <3
[01:54:03] <maverun[m]> atm element, but i am gonna checking out that weechat later or if there is better one later when i get a chance
[01:54:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> armin:libera.chat: my point is you're soapboxing. I'm an aging linux sysadmin
[01:54:20] <armin> sunjonSenghanBri: what's soapboxing? yeah, me too.
[01:54:25] <YorickPeterse[m]> windwp[m]: I generally hate web tech, but I use Element. Sadly the other Matrix clients for linux are....not great
[01:54:37] <armin> YorickPeterse[m]: +1
[01:54:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm not saying discussing terminals isn't fun. But it's been overdone here, and there's nothing in this conversation other than "blue good" "red bettter!"
[01:54:45] <mjlbach[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: neochat IMO is good
[01:54:45] <sb[m]1> armin: There's that version of w3m that renders graphics as overlay over your terminal emulator
[01:55:04] <p00f[m]> Neochat is good if you can stand the ui
[01:55:05] <elianiva[m]> mjlbach[m]: seconding this, it's pretty good
[01:55:15] <YorickPeterse[m]> I think I briefly tried it, but didn't really like it
[01:55:26] <YorickPeterse[m]> I really want an IRC style layout so I can read more than 3 messages at a time, but ugh
[01:55:29] <armin> sb[m]1: i would not use that. a terminal emulator is for displaying text. if it can display that using ascii characters, fine, but stop putting actual images on top of that and call that "rendered in terminal". that's just plain terrible.
[01:55:32] <YorickPeterse[m]> Gomuks comes close, but it only supports a light theme
[01:55:39] <YorickPeterse[m]> and a light theme on a light themed terminal doesn't work lol
[01:55:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> (half the UI ends up blending into the background)
[01:55:50] <sb[m]1> armin: I think nobody would really use that, but it was a nice proof-of-concept
[01:56:06] <mjlbach[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: weechat?
[01:56:37] <maverun[m]> i feel like this is where the moment i ss my entirely desktop just to show how pathetic i am using element/discord etc
[01:56:40] <YorickPeterse[m]> Tried the Matrix plugin, but IIRC it's discontinued and the replacement wasn't really viable
[01:56:51] <YorickPeterse[m]> also Weechat lacks text wrapping, which I really want

[02:00:33] <bfredl> drinking while procrastrinating exactly the right stage of my thesis writing, that is
[02:01:44] <maverun[m]> put your thesis on hold till at a last <del>minute</del> month
[02:02:52] <bfredl> I've seen worse. I mean, at least two LaTeX clones written to write thesis in :P
[02:03:07] <maverun[m]> latex, i need to consider checking that
[02:03:39] <mjlbach[m]> It's pretty easy to get started in neovim, vimtex + lspconfig (texlab + ltex-ls) gives you quite a nice setup
[02:03:46] <maverun[m]> it is easier to use latex to replace word or eh to make pdf document? cuz i want a way to write without rely on libreoffice or word
[02:04:06] <elianiva[m]> pdf
[02:04:17] <clason[m]> it compiles directly to PDF
[02:04:34] <p00f[m]> You probably can convert it to word tho
[02:04:38] <p00f[m]> Atleast odt
[02:04:39] <clason[m]> (but you can also use pandoc to do that from markdown)
[02:04:51] <clason[m]> why on earth would you want to do that o.O?
[02:05:04] <maverun[m]> (mainly cuz i am complaining the fact i cant use vim key and amount of time i try doing it in vim way on office/word)
[02:05:04] <maverun[m]> ah no i mean, can latex replace entirely of word/office? bold, heading, formatting etc
[02:05:07] <bfredl> with equations rendered as metafiles, or what?

[02:06:24] <maverun[m]> ^
[02:06:29] <elianiva[m]> it's just that the output isn't odt/docx
[02:06:37] <clason[m]> yes, the point being never having to deal with a word-a-like again...
[02:06:56] <maverun[m]> i dont mind output, well usually it would be pdf so it fine
[02:06:57] <maverun[m]> alright neato, i should spent a day learning it
[02:07:23] <elianiva[m]> there are tons of stuff in latex, but basic text formatting is quite easy
[02:07:37] <maverun[m]> btw guy, this is aint neovim chat, but a main one, are we gonna get trouble xD
[02:07:48] <clason[m]> yeah, if you can wrap your head around HTML, you can deal with LaTeX

[02:37:09] <elianiva[m]> is this a known issue? I mean, the document_highlight got the wrong range.
[02:37:09] <elianiva[m]> My guess would be somewhat related to something something utf incremental sync
[02:38:23] <YorickPeterse[m]> <maverun[m]> "i feel like we are gonna enter..." <- If I had to pick, probably Weechat since it's more customisable 
[02:38:42] <YorickPeterse[m]> Gomuks seems to take the Go approach of "options are for dummies"
[02:38:43] <Cobra[m]> weechat matrix is limited
[02:39:28] <Cobra[m]> gomuks does need to have options but its much better than weechat
[02:39:35] <jaawerth[m]> maverun: I haven't used gomuks but I use the weechat matrix plugin heavily and the big caveat for me is this - depends on how much of a deal-breaker it is for you https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix/issues/189 (won't be fixed in the current script, so it's a matter of when the rust rewrite for it is done)
[02:39:56] <jaawerth[m]> for me it's worth it so I can just have my matrix and IRC buffers in one big happy family but ymmv
[02:40:23] <Cobra[m]> you cant upload react or reply in weechat 
[02:40:45] <jaawerth[m]> why would I upload react
[02:40:48] <jaawerth[m]> (j/k)
[02:41:06] <agriffis[m]> Big difference between iterm2/kitty and alacritty/foot/vte is that the former support ligatures (fira code, cascadia code, recursive mono, etc)
[02:41:12] <Cobra[m]> Cobra[m]: or delete
[02:41:34] <agriffis[m]> (Yes I'm following up on a conversation that's long past)
[02:41:57] <agriffis[m]> * mono, etc) and the latter don't.
[02:42:10] <jaawerth[m]> you also see other people's deletions as strikethrough in weechat rather than the message going away, which could be considered either a plus or a minus

[04:15:18] <phaazon[m]> https://phaazon.net/blog/neovim-plugins-stability mjlbach I’ll probably wait for a bunch of reviews from people here before posting that to Reddit 🙂
[04:16:58] <aphysically> I get this sometimes output in my terminal leftover after I've edited a text file williamboman [nvim-lsp-installer] ...ged/nvim-lsp-installer/lua/nvim-lsp-installer/server.lua:66: Unable to setup server "pyright": Could not find lspconfig server entry. Make sure you are running a recent version of lspconfig.
[04:17:04] <aphysically> (not a python file...)
[04:17:12] <aphysically> I haven't figured out how to reliably reproduce it yet
[04:17:52] <aphysically> like, e.g. https://bpa.st/BNCA
[04:19:13] <aphysically> I don't know if there's some sort of race condition because my load ordering has some subtle incorrectness or what https://bpa.st/ADKA
[04:19:32] <aphysically> I don't ever see an error while running neovim it's only dumped to my terminal after it's closed
[04:20:27] <aphysically> oh I think I can reproduce it reliably now williamboman; it's happening when I abort an edit because of a swap file
[04:21:01] <aphysically> maybe nvim-lsp-installer is messing up something there?
[04:21:45] <aphysically> note pyright and stuff works fine, this is just an error that shows up in my terminal in that specific situation (that's not even related to a python file)

[04:26:15] <ii14[m]> yeah, I think tags are generally a good idea. but does it actually solve the problem of compatibility with dependencies? how should I know what version of a plugin is compatible with my neovim version or with some other plugin? for that you'd have to standardize some sort of manifest file, and that better be a solid and well thought out before it gets adopted phaazon

[04:37:11] <ii14[m]> maybe the answer is just to maintain both APIs and nag the user with warnings if you're using the old one. that will hint that if you don't want or don't have the time to upgrade it, you should lock the plugin to the current commit phaazon 
[04:37:43] <ii14[m]> and have a variable like `g:myplugin_deprecated` that will silence those warnings, in case they're too annoying

[16:51:18] <madddd[m]> I think the problem is with emmet-ls since the author of cmp has closed one issue related to emmet-ls where he said that other servers work fine so the problem is emmet-ls.

[19:38:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> slap-up?
[19:38:39] <YorickPeterse[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): That's one option, but I prefer not to hack it like that
[19:38:43] <clason[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: do you want to remove the underlines temporarily or not show them altogether
[19:38:46] <clason[m]> * them altogether?
[19:38:56] <lalitmeeLalitKum> @clason:matrix.org , tried removing the `.deps` folder but it is still throwing the same error as earlier.
[19:38:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> yorickpeterse:matrix.org: that's not hacking; that's user customisation
[19:39:07] <YorickPeterse[m]> Temporarily while entering insert mode, then show them again when leaving (mostly just experimenting what that would look like)
[19:39:26] <clason[m]> (usual drama; this time about how developers should just be writing documentation, because it's so easy)
[19:39:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> ah yeah
[19:39:43] <mjlbach[m]> hrsh7th did write a vimdoc for their plugin, i'ts PR'd
[19:39:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> read that yesterday. Made me want to write less docs :]
[19:40:09] <clason[m]> which is why I thought that extra-uncalled for...
[19:40:31] <clason[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: probably would have to first hide everything, then show with underline disabled
[19:40:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> "for why do we pay our monies?"
[19:40:39] <Bowuigi[m]> YorickPeterse[m]: The only way I know is by using the InsertEnter and InsertLeave autocommands and changing the colorscheme group accordingly
[19:41:35] <YorickPeterse[m]> I guess one option is to override `vim.diagnostic.handlers.underline.show`
[19:41:45] <clason[m]> why?

[19:42:50] <clason[m]> alternatively, `hide` could be extended to also take an `opt` dict
[19:42:54] <clason[m]> mjlbach: ?
[19:43:18] <mjlbach[m]> This is one of those things where I'm mixed because it seems like such a nice usecase
[19:43:20] <mjlbach[m]> s/nice/niche/
[19:43:23] <sunjonSenghanBri> or do it externally and point the handler to <orig> or <none> accoringly
[19:43:31] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders may have a different opinion
[19:43:45] <clason[m]> yeah, for me it's mainly an argument from symmetry
[19:44:07] <clason[m]> I see no reason why `hide` shouldn't have the same signature as `show`

[19:50:55] <YorickPeterse[m]> Basically I'm trying to find a way to handle diagnostics that span many lines, which can be annoying when you're typing
[19:50:55] <gpanders> gpanders: the reason I didn't do this is because right now `hide()` ignores opts completely. Hide just hides each handler, full stop

[20:35:22] <jaawerth> ii14[m]: sumneko uses a specific library/format, EmmyLua, for the docstrings - which seems to be ported from the vscode ecosystem. the sunmeko wiki talks about it on this page (and the @type stuff in this section) so if there's a way to bypass it would probably somewhere in there or in one of the links: https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations#types-and-type

[20:46:48] <jaawerth> I've also used lua-lsp before and found it to be decent. iirc they each have their upsides but I assume there were very good reasons the nvim-lsp team went with sumneko

[22:21:59] <jaawerth> well, that has it properly
[22:22:17] <sammie1> Any advice?

[22:22:48] <clason[m]> maybe ask on #nvim-telescope_community:gitter.im ?
[22:23:26] <jaawerth[m]> is that bridged to libera?
[22:23:29] <clason[m]> no
[22:23:36] <clason[m]> but you can access it from Gitter
[22:23:47] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@72-46-48-28.lnk.ne.static.allophone.net) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[22:24:26] <jaawerth[m]> oh! hence the gitter link I suppose (though the bridge doesn't translate it)
[22:24:40] <jaawerth[m]> I'm sure it will eventually
[22:24:49] <clason[m]> I don't think so...
[22:25:43] <clason[m]> (any gitter room -- which is now a matrix room since the singularity -- is bridged automatically to Matrix)
[22:26:15] <clason[m]> (Libera bridge has to be set up explicitly for each room, and is a bit of a pain...)
[22:27:28] <nmuntz87[m]> is there a way to get "startup logs" for nvim? im migrating my configs to lua and some plugins are not properly loading their config files but nvim is not being explicit at all about what's wrong
[22:27:49] <clason[m]> there's `--startuptime`
[22:27:49] <sammie1> Don't know anything about gitter or matrix. Matrix' suggested way to connect is `/join #nvim-telescope_community:gitter.im` (https://matrix.to/#/#nvim-telescope_community:gitter.im) but that room is empty... 
[22:27:51] <ii14[m]> --startuptime
[22:28:06] <clason[m]> you can (and should) also check `:scriptnames`
[22:28:36] <clason[m]> sammie1: maybe nobody there at the moment
[22:28:46] <jaawerth[m]> sammie1: looking at `:help builtin.lsp_range_code_actions`, I think you need to pass in `start_line` as an option when directly invoking from Lua but it says you can also use the command `:'<,'>Telescope lsp_range_code_actions`
[22:29:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> it calls a make_range_params in their absence

[22:30:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> 1841 should have populated `A`
[22:31:30] <sammie1> jaawerth[m]: Thanks, that seems to work. I think I need to connect to gitter server (instead of libera?) and join there. Appreciated the answer despite asking in wrong place. clason[m]: I'll make sure to ask in the appropriate place next time
[22:32:06] <clason[m]> That was just a recommendation because the devs hang out (only) there, not a "don't ask here"!

[23:22:31] <ii14[m]> someone made a foot pedal for vim, but everyone probably seen this already too
