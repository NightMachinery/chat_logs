[01:43:45] <KillerWasp> what chance is there of people using emscripten with the program as if it were usual?
[01:44:15] <pyzozord> maybe some of those patterns could narrow it down to specific code like a framework or library, from there you could assume since library is in language x that means the server runs language x

[02:22:16] <nomagno> EdFletcher: My identifying information is less than 16 bits
[02:22:19] <flakland> intelx86 for example has string instructions

[02:22:46] <nomagno> Not about instructions
[02:22:53] <nomagno> the instruction set is stabilized

[02:24:06] <jkk> pyzozord: if you do not share any personal data that leaves only what - stylelometry
[02:24:14] <flakland> so when you say VM< you really mean a full fledged programming lang
[02:24:31] <nomagno> It's a custom CPU with a custom instruction set with a custom assembly
[02:24:37] <pyzozord> jkk: it will be hard to identify things, the javascript might as well create a checksum of all known fonts and just send the checksum and you wouldn't be any wiser without reading the javascript

[02:24:42] <nomagno> I only have 16 instructions

[02:54:57] <nomagno> Stryyker: Rest assured it is 16 bits, I just need to make the address to read it be divided in LSB and MSB
[02:55:09] <flakland> you measure it by ratio of alpha wave?
[02:55:10] <KillerWasp> the size from the center to the last electron that atom can have.
[02:55:21] <nomagno> Will go change this right now, FFFA for MSB, FFFB for LSB
[02:55:26] <[itchyjunk]> You measure if by the deflection patterns of the alpha waves.
[02:55:29] <nomagno> Any other suggestions?
[02:55:32] <apotheon> You realize that an alpha particle has the mass of a helium atom -- right?
[02:55:35] <flakland> so size == pattern
[02:55:37] <flakland> ?????
[02:55:43] <[itchyjunk]> alpha waves, beta particles
[02:56:01] <[itchyjunk]> no it doesn't
[02:56:03] <apotheon> I mean . . . it'd have be be a pretty big atom for a alpha waves to be an effective means of measuring "volume".
[02:56:09] <[itchyjunk]> a helium atom is not the same as alpha particle
[02:56:10] <apotheon> s/a alpha/alpha/
[02:56:14] <[itchyjunk]> so their masses can't be the same.
[02:56:17] <apotheon> I didn't say it was the same.
[02:56:23] <jkk> pyzozord: its gotta simple :) server uses code to instruct browser to draw canvass ok - how that code detects it?
[02:56:25] <[itchyjunk]> hydrogen minues one electron behaves as one.
[02:56:27] <apotheon> . . . but the difference in mass is the weight of the helium atom's electrons.
[02:56:33] <[itchyjunk]> but that has the mass one hydrogen minus one electron.
[02:56:37] <apotheon> . . . if it has two neutrons.
[02:56:43] <[itchyjunk]>  . . . no.
[02:56:50] <flakland> thats jst a proton
[02:56:51] <apotheon> If not, the alpha particle is *more massy* than the helium atom.
[02:57:18] <apotheon> Alpha particles are basically He-4 nuclei.

[04:45:01] <sonny> [itchyjunk] what's the tldr for privacy?
[04:45:33] <PlanckWalk> tldr: You need to live under a rock to get any privacy
[04:45:39] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, depending on your threat model, you should change your signature.
[04:46:03] <sonny> how can that be done?
[04:46:04] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, trying to hide signature from a ML model is different than trying to hide you signature from certian people who are specifically looking for you
[04:46:19] <sonny> I'm quite sure all my efforts have just given me a really unique signature
[04:46:39] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, i noticed that if i want to search of certain theoritical cs topic and i try it directly, it gives me a lot of vague js tutorials
[04:47:00] <[itchyjunk]> if i search some math related to it frist then do a new search with the cs term
[04:47:08] <[itchyjunk]> it gives me very different results
[04:47:20] <[itchyjunk]> i feel like my search chaining biases the AI enough
[04:47:22] <sonny> yes, in general I've gotten products when I search for thing
[04:47:41] <sonny> I use more terms and advanced features when I search these days
[04:47:50] <[itchyjunk]> so if i wanted AI to think i am not searching for say bombs, i'd first search for some bomb meme
[04:47:55] <[itchyjunk]> then search for bomb
[04:48:05] <PlanckWalk> So long as you produce lots of different unique signatures, it's not so bad
[04:48:06] <sonny> makes sense
[04:48:16] <[itchyjunk]> because people who first watched memed then googled it might be more common that it's not flagged
[04:48:17] <sonny> too bad google limits search queries
[04:48:47] <sonny> I've gotten the bot captcha just for regular stuff

[08:32:30] <Kerr> I'm thinking of making a CNC machine controller from scratch for my capstone project in my EE program. Would anyone here have specific thoughts on how they would approach writing a G code interpreter/Machine controller's code? I have some thoughts but would like to elicit some opinions.
[08:36:51] <Kerr> In my mind i would parse the G-code and build a mathmatic model of where the machine should be in each axis at all times, then use timers and interrupts to compare the current location to the calculated one, step if it would put the axis closer to where it should be
[08:38:05] <Kerr> Having the interrupts occur as often as I would issue pulses to the motors, say 8khz as a ballpark.
[08:38:48] <Kerr> Then there are other utilities aside, like loading programs
[08:42:16] <sonny67> why not make your own code?
[08:42:38] <sonny67> unless you are already familar with g-code

[22:21:01] <[itchyjunk]> behold, (\x.xx) (\x.xx)
[22:21:13] * [itchyjunk] sees lightnings in the background
[22:22:04] <GeDaMo> What does that result in?
[22:23:03] <pyzozord> infinite loop?
[22:24:34] <sonny> what does "composed character" mean?
[22:25:02] <GeDaMo> You can combine characters to produce other characters e.g. o + " gives ö
[22:25:28] <sonny> ok, can I interpret that as unicode?
[22:25:37] <[itchyjunk]> GeDaMo, so (\x.xx) is the function that accepts a parameter and i pass it (\x.xx) as the parameter
[22:25:40] <GeDaMo> Interpret what as Unicode?
[22:25:55] <GeDaMo> Composing characters existed before Unicode
[22:26:04] <sonny> [itchyjunk] it's not (\ ."hello world")?
[22:26:04] <[itchyjunk]> so (\x.xx) y => yy, thus (\x.xx) (\x.xx) => (\x.xx) (\x.xx)
[22:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> i haven't see "hellow world" in the encoding
[22:26:25] <[itchyjunk]> all illegal characters
[22:26:33] <[itchyjunk]> afaik at least
[22:26:38] <[itchyjunk]> i don't how how it would be done
[22:26:48] <InPhase> Like this:  (x.x)_/_Hello world_\
[22:26:48] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, same reason printing "hello world" in asm wasn't hello world
[22:27:03] <[itchyjunk]> because you needed to write a kernet or someshit to take to uArt to talk to moniter etc etc
[22:27:27] <sonny> GeDaMo oh, I am working with an object that gets "composed characters", when I tried to compare to a utf-16 code unit 'a' nothing happened
[22:27:44] <sonny> so I'm guessing a is not a composed character
[22:27:49] <sonny> 'a'
[22:28:09] <apotheon> a is a
[22:28:21] <sonny> [itchyjunk] just put "hello world" inside x

[22:28:29] <sonny> (\. x)
[22:28:57] <[itchyjunk]> that would just be \x.x
[22:28:57] <sonny> [itchyjunk] I have no idea what I'm taking about carry on
[22:29:08] <[itchyjunk]> (\x.x)"hello world!"
[22:29:10] <sonny> oh right
[22:29:13] <[itchyjunk]> if thats valid for x
[22:29:24] <[itchyjunk]> apparently, once you define true and false, you get if else immidately
[22:29:28] <[itchyjunk]> looks like ternary oepration
[22:29:29] <sonny> no, I'm pretty sure you don't need to introduce the variable there?

[22:30:09] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[22:30:23] <sonny> pretty sure there is a function that just returns something
[22:30:23] <[itchyjunk]> because i defined it to.
[22:30:29] <[itchyjunk]> sure
[22:30:33] <sonny> (\. 42)

[23:06:07] <pyzozord> is qm somehow more difficult or more complex than other fields?

[23:06:36] <sonny> when I looked at some here and US they have positions for chemistry stuff
[23:06:38] <[itchyjunk]> QM also requires slightly more math than just college algebra

[23:40:17] <deniska> hans: VB6 is old enough to be on various abandonware "old games" kinds of sites
[23:40:39] <deniska> hans: the problem is that iirc VB6 the IDE doesn't run on anything newer than XP
[23:41:02] <hans> deniska, that's not true, i've ran VB6 IDE just fine on windows 7 and 10
[23:41:20] <hans> deniska, maybe "VB6 Sevice Pack 6" was a requirement tho, idk

[23:46:20] <sonny> winui is neat because ui elements are defined descriptively (xml) but there is a lot of information packed into it, and it is bundled in a weird way. it is a really easy way to make simple native apps for windows
