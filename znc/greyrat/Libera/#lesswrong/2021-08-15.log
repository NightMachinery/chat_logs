[12:58:04] <quanticle> >bizarre user-hostile design choices like a single volume setting for everything
[12:58:06] <quanticle> What do you mean by "a single volume setting for everything"? Do you mean that there was a single volume setting for all output devices? Or do you mean that it had a single volume setting for all apps? Because Android has the latter. It stores a volume for each output device (headphones, phone speaker, Bluetooth speakers, Chromecast, etc) and all apps output audio at that volume.
[12:58:08] <quanticle> >and requiring the Zune application for desktop sync
[12:58:10] <quanticle> Don't iPhones *still* require iTunes for desktop sync? I'm sure that seemed much more reasonable at the time, given that Windows Phone always seemed to be competing more with iOS than Android.
[13:01:01] <nshepperd2> android has different volume settings for broad categories "media" "alarms" and "phone"

[13:56:00] <quanticle> Yeah, iOS originally shipped with a model that prohibited most background processing. That model has been relaxed somewhat today, but it's still considerably more restrictive than Android's. Android's model, as far as I know, is, "You can do whatever you want in the background, but if your app is in the background the OS may nondeterministically hibernate it if it needs resources." Android's
[13:56:02] <quanticle> model is most like that of a "real OS", but in the context of a phone, I feel like the iOS model is better for both the user and the developer.
