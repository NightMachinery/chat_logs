[05:14:13] <jeaye> It's not an SPA using the latest framework.
[05:14:19] <InPhase> ITD4004: It's brief, but we considered it sufficient in scope for the fundamentals.
[05:15:03] <ITD4004> i just came in wanting to learn how to Rust

[05:16:54] <ITD4004> right
[05:17:07] <ITD4004> to be fair my programming background mainly consists of quickbms scripts
[05:17:22] <ITD4004> had to learn how to script for two years
[05:17:42] <ITD4004> even then that wasn't enough as my experience with the quickbms language went by

[05:20:03] <ITD4004> tried to do C as well but every time i tried to write a C program, it felt like i was learning "how to C" in not the right way

[05:22:26] <ITD4004> that's the thing
[05:22:53] <ITD4004> when i think of "sticking with something" i think of "uh-oh someone's being stubborn and that's baaaaaaaaaaaad"
[05:23:17] <ITD4004> instead of "this will actually take me somewhere"
[05:23:35] <vdamewood> Go back to Python. See what barriers you run into.
[05:23:51] <luiserebii> There are some nice books for Python... I liked "Think Python"
[05:24:02] <vdamewood> Then get around them. Odds are, you'll learn more about programming.

[06:49:48] <vdamewood> Unfortunately, the LGPL requires that users be able to modify the library, and the app store doesn't allow that, so you can't really use the LGPL in an app-store app.

[08:10:24] <chance> Volund: to be clear, your layout makes sense to me. it's the idea of synchronizing state that i question, and why. the only two things your session manager needs to tell the service are that (X IP with Y token) is (connection #Z), and when that session token should time out
[08:10:41] <chance> and the only thing the service needs to tell the session manager is that connection Z has timed out or quit
[08:11:46] <chance> if the user disconnects and reconnects, they're either gonna do that directly with the service, which still has the unexpired token, or they're gonna get kicked back through the session init process, either way it's the same two pieces of information, as needed

[09:29:36] <PlanckWalk> If there are no branches at all, it sounds like it's not Turing complete.
[09:29:41] <bcount`d> it checks status reg but i wonder if you can chain it with other instructions that aren't specifically meant to modify status
[09:31:02] <PlanckWalk> Although I guess it could be if you can still have unconditional jumps
[09:31:47] <jcarpenter2> i think the lambda calculus is turing complete but doesn't have branching
[09:32:17] <PlanckWalk> I guess that depends upon which level of abstraction you look
[09:32:23] <jcarpenter2> of course the runtime needs to branch to see if it's finished evaluation or if it still needs to go on
[09:32:36] <blahboybaz> If a try / catch block doesn't fit your use case then does the necessarily mean it isn't an error that you need to handle? In other words, are there other ways to handle an exceptioon than the functionality that try / catch provides?
[09:33:24] <blahboybaz> isn't an error that you need to handle \ isn't an exception you are dealing with
[09:33:25] <PlanckWalk> If an exception is thrown, usually the only way to handle it is with a catch.

[09:42:25] <blahboybaz> PlanckWalk: Well it's a utility funciton being used in all the other functions. It takes an index value and returns a node at that index. However, if a value that exceeds the bounds of the list is entered (ie: index < 0 || incex > list.size) then that's an exception that needs handledd. Thing is, because it's the dependency of those other functions it has an effect upon them when that exception
[09:42:31] <blahboybaz> happens.

[13:06:15] <papillon> mrig: Read Shahnameh for a while.
[13:06:16] <ronald_mcdonald> And migration or not doesn't matter, the fact is that languages like latin and classical greek are artificially propped up (and historically restricted) which is the reason they have had less change

[14:14:50] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: you can add names to a symbol table as you encounter them
[14:14:52] <pyzozord> From what I understand the compiler will first parse the code into AST, then do multiple passes on the AST until all "dependencies" are resolved. Does that mean that the compiler has a gigantic hash map of all symbols and scopes and as it walks the AST it adds new information to those symbols?

[17:02:14] <piou> I haven't read the backlog but "If you encrypt with the private key then any person who has the public key can decrypt it" -> yeah, don't do that, it works with naive "textbook" RSA but that's very RSA specific and even in that case real-world implementations generate private and public key differently because there are many subtle attacks that can occur and the properties of each are different.
[17:02:20] <piou> Encrypt with the public key, decrypt with the private one, don't mix them up, use separate keys for signing if you want to do that. Cryptography implementation doesn't have to be difficult, it's all about following the standard as closely as possible and not acting smart.
[17:04:05] <piou> NeatNit: as for this bit on the secret: the secret must a secret string. A random string is a good recommendation, while their other recommendation of using the public key encoded in some form is just plain stupid because if you use public value as a secret then it's not secret anymore. Note: encoded isn't encrypted, it just means written in another way, so you don't "encode with the private key".

[21:42:56] <ronald_mcdonald> pyzozord, oh of course

[21:43:07] <jeaye> Then maybe don't say it like it's such a fact.
[21:43:53] <jeaye> I highly doubt it takes several minutes to open Atom on a Linux machine with only 2GB RAM, let alone 4GB.

[21:44:31] <pyzozord> it's a shame atom lost with vs code though, but vs code is less laggy. Although I have bigger sentiment to atom, I was in the beta and was very excited at first about it
[21:44:32] <ronald_mcdonald> I might try emacs next
[21:44:37] <jeaye> For the simple reason that browsers open up more quickly than that and the slow part of Atom is that it contains part of a browser.

[21:46:18] <pyzozord> ronald_mcdonald: but I should explore more emacs at some point
[21:46:21] <ronald_mcdonald> What language does vi use?
[21:46:40] <ronald_mcdonald> in the sense of emacs being programmable/customizable via a lisp
[21:46:43] <beaky> vi uses its own language ex i think (which is extended from ed)
[21:46:44] <ronald_mcdonald> whats the equivalent in vi
[21:46:45] <pyzozord> ronald_mcdonald: vi doesn't have a language, it has a custom .edrc which uses ed syntax
[21:46:55] <ronald_mcdonald> I see
[21:47:04] <pyzozord> ronald_mcdonald: vim uses viml a language that is an extended version of that ed syntax

[21:47:09] <ronald_mcdonald> I think I'd just try emacs next

[21:58:24] <pyzozord> iosef: but yeah having my own editor just how I like it beats that in the long term, you can meet many teams, but if you have a personal editor, it's yours with you until the end
[21:58:30] <Donitz> what is an efficient method of checking two bitmap collisions?
[21:58:31] <iosef> pyzozord: The same thing happened to me. I use Linux and had to leave the last job because working on Visual Studio was a requirement for the job. They always kept chastising me because I didn't use IntelliSense and syntax highlighting.
[21:58:52] <Donitz> ie, finding which pixels collide, and the bitmaps can be offset by x,y
[21:59:02] <iosef> pyzozord: A personal tool which is customisable is very helpful for productivity.
[21:59:24] <pyzozord> iosef: don't know what's the term for that, but there is a cast of developers who think they know what is the correct way to program and everybody else is wrong

[22:00:35] <iosef> pyzozord: People who keep using Windows for personal coding are beyond any prosetylisation.
[22:00:44] <Donitz> nothing wrong with windows for coding
[22:00:44] <pyzozord> iosef: no no, I don't think so. My tech lead is very talented. He just doesn't take into account that he might be wrong sometimes, or that there might exist alternative answers just as good that work better for other people
[22:00:46] <iosef> pyzozord: I hope I spelled it right.

[22:01:26] <iosef> Donitz: It's not morally wrong, I guess. It's toooooooooo cumbersome.
[22:01:26] <Donitz> also, there is nothing wrong with mouse-centered text editors
[22:01:32] <Donitz> I prefer them
[22:01:41] <ronald_mcdonald> Yeah nothing wrong with mice
[22:01:45] <iosef> Donitz: Go ahead.
[22:01:56] <Donitz> and I'm hardly a slow coder

[22:02:10] <iosef> Donitz: This another thing. If someone criticises people using Windows, they take it as an attack on their intelligence.
[22:02:24] <iosef> Donitz: I didn't criticise you.
[22:02:32] <iosef> Donitz: You're probably a brilliant coder.
[22:02:34] <Donitz> eh, it's just common critique of people not using vim
[22:02:35] <pyzozord> Donitz: one very interesting mouse-centered text editor is Sam http://sam.cat-v.org/
[22:02:37] <Donitz> that vim is so much faster
[22:02:45] <iosef> Donitz: No.
[22:02:47] <pulse> funny i use both vim and a mouse :p
[22:02:56] <pyzozord> although I'm personally not into mouse stuff
[22:03:03] <iosef> Donitz: I think people who use nano could be better coder than vim wizards.
[22:03:46] <ronald_mcdonald> So apparently in emacs the default is "insert mode"

[22:04:15] <iosef> Donitz: It's just that if the same people could customise the editor to fit their needs instead of customising themselves to fit the editor's need, they would have to spend much less mental energy.
[22:04:30] <iosef> Donitz: Tools are at least as important as the physical environment.
[22:04:33] <Donitz> in my personal opinion, the less you have to customize, the better
[22:04:39] <Donitz> I try to get used to the defaults of most things
[22:04:48] <Donitz> because I know I will have to set it up over and over and over
[22:04:51] <iosef> Donitz: What's the temperature in your room?
[22:04:53] <pyzozord> iosef: I think what editor you use is way too little information to judge how good a coder you are. Also the metric of "good coder" is inherintly flawed. No point comparing like that
[22:04:57] <Donitz> feels like 30 c
[22:05:03] <iosef> pyzozord: Certainly.
[22:05:43] <ronald_mcdonald> It seems emacs people have written many general purpose software packages for it in the emacs lisp
[22:05:45] <Donitz> ah, found a nice solution for my bitmappy issue. I'll just save the edge pixels and compare those
[22:05:46] <psydroid> why would you have to set things up over and over and over?
[22:05:53] <ronald_mcdonald> in some senses emacs is more than an editor then
[22:06:01] <pyzozord> I like terminal based editors because they can leverage the power of all of the shell as part of the "ide"
[22:06:01] <iosef> Donitz: Imagine it was always 38C and there was no way to change it. Imagine your chair was stuck at a particular angle and you couldn't change it. While the default editor settings in Visual Studio, etc. are not horrible. They could be cutomised to proper taste.
[22:06:19] <Donitz> that's why I like dumb editors iosef

[22:06:39] <pyzozord> entire shell becomes an "integrated development environment" and it makes sense - it's in the name. It's an entire environment of a developer.
[22:06:48] <iosef> Donitz: I think your opinion of vim users is biased because you have only seen hip users who try to make an ide out of vim
[22:06:53] <Donitz> I like geany these days
[22:06:59] <Donitz> because geany looks exactly the same on windows and linux
[22:07:19] <ronald_mcdonald> Donitz, does nano look the same on windows?

[22:07:29] <Donitz> I haven't tried it
[22:07:38] <Donitz> vim on windows is very bloated

[22:13:43] <pyzozord> I think it's very fun

[22:15:00] <pyzozord> I mean i really like modal editing, it's in my muscle memory, and feels extremly expressive and fast. But I feel ed-based line editing of issuing commands is much more fun
[22:15:16] <iosef> pyzozord: You already have it in `sed`.
[22:15:44] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: In Vim, "i" is not the only key to go into insert mode.
[22:15:47] <pyzozord> iosef: you can escape to ed mode in vi/vim too with Q in normal mode
[22:15:59] <iosef> pyzozord: Yeah.

[22:16:44] <pyzozord> but I would like that kind of ed-like command based editor to not opreate on lines - rather on ast of the language

[22:20:57] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: Don't worry. Emacs does support arrow keys as far as I remember.
[22:21:27] <pyzozord> ex is because it's extended ed. And ex/vi because vi and next are kind of two editors in one programs, you can think of them as two major modes for the same program

[22:28:50] <iosef> pyzozord: No. I did code in gVim in my company for some tasks. But the build had to be done on Visual Studio. I did not know how to call Powershell properly in gVim.
[22:29:30] <ronald_mcdonald> They are in an awkward position in the middle of the keyboard. wasd sits nicely at the topmost and leftmost of the alphabet keys. And the arrow keys need no explanation. h and l are still alright. Its j and k being horizontal rather than vertical that becomes confusing for me.
[22:29:33] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: It's like right v left hand. If you practice enough, you could write with left hand too.
[22:29:47] <pyzozord> oh that reminds me, I wanted to install steam via wine
[22:29:47] <ronald_mcdonald> There is nothing to remember which is top and which is bottom besides convention.
[22:30:02] <pyzozord> see if I can play some windows games on my linux
[22:30:04] <ronald_mcdonald> pyzozord, normal steam actually uses wine these days
[22:30:05] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: My finger is always on the j key coz it's engraved. I don't need to look down.
[22:30:15] <ronald_mcdonald> they have a steam client for linux
[22:30:21] <ronald_mcdonald> and it uses wine internally for the windows games
[22:30:37] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: Just thing you need to feel the bump and what do you do when you open a new file, you go down. "j" -> down.
[22:30:44] <ronald_mcdonald> well as I said due to video games and natural position of the key wasd is blind for me too
[22:30:49] <pyzozord> ronald_mcdonald: I know but many games are still not supported in that mode. I'm hoping I can install windows's steam via wine, and that way I'll be able to install age of empires 2 definitive edition :D
[22:31:01] <ronald_mcdonald> I see pyzozord
[22:31:08] <iosef> ronald_mcdonald: w a s d is unintuitive for me coz they are on the left hand, lol.

[22:31:45] <ronald_mcdonald> I am not one either, the games I play are of a distinctly non-gamer bent.
[22:31:55] <iosef> pyzozord: Can you run Adobe products through Wine?
[22:32:33] <ronald_mcdonald> wasd is just a relaxing position to keep your arm on
[22:32:36] <pyzozord> iosef: I think it's possible and quite well supported since there is a big demand for that specifically, but I personally never tried
[22:32:45] <ronald_mcdonald> if you are right handed at least
[22:32:59] <iosef> pyzozord: I wanted to use something like Adobe After Effects.
[22:33:24] <iosef> pyzozord: There is no alternative on Linux except Blender, but it's like a whole factory there.
[22:33:51] <pyzozord> ronald_mcdonald: I'd argue asdf is actually more comfortable, fingers are aligned, pinky is not off in akward position for shift or even worse caps lock

[22:34:58] <ronald_mcdonald> But its all a horizontal row
[22:35:08] <ronald_mcdonald> mapping from horizontal to up-down is a confusing thing for brain
