[00:21:24] <kakashiA1> at the moment I have two answers why its required:

[00:34:28] <[itchyjunk]> well a limit exists when left and right limit exists and are equal is one way limits are taught
[00:34:30] <cherim> But if you already have both one-sided and normal and compare them, then in typical applications having one-sided limits only but not the usual limit makes a function closer to non-differentiable ones by properties
[00:34:32] <[itchyjunk]> I remember this being taught

[01:25:18] <cuppajoeman> what is the advantage of using this?
[01:26:46] <Z-module> it's just a way of naming sets
[01:27:52] <Z-module> instead of each set in the infinite collection having a name totally different from every other name in there, like, U, V, W, ...., we make all the names based on one symbol (typically "U") and give those subscripts.

[01:28:45] <Z-module> especially when you get into subcollections, etc.

[01:34:15] <cuppajoeman> how would a finite union of balls still be a ball through?
[01:34:26] <Z-module> it's not: it's some union of balls
[01:34:31] <Galois> also, infinite unions are allowed
[01:34:35] <Z-module> an infinite such union
[01:34:52] <cuppajoeman> but only finite intersections?
[01:35:14] <Galois> a finite intersection of unions of balls is still a union of balls. If you haven't proved this, you should.
[01:35:22] <Z-module> sorry, I thought you said how would the intersection of two open balls be an open ball.  It's not, but it *is* (as you can prove fairly easily) a union of open balls.
[01:35:31] <Z-module> right, only finite intersections in general
[01:35:42] <cuppajoeman> Why is that the case that intersections be finite??
[01:36:01] <Galois> it is possible to take an infinite intersection of unions of balls and end up with a result which is not a union of balls.
[01:36:06] <Galois> If you haven't proved this, then you should.
[01:36:12] <Z-module> for example in R, the intersection of all the open balls (intervals)  (-1/1, 1/1),  (-1/2, 1/2), (-1/3, 1/3), ... is the set {0}. THis set is not open in R: it is not a union of open balls.
[01:36:37] <Galois> I know Z-module is trying to help, but in the end there is no substitute for you doing the work to figure out these things on your own.
[01:36:49] <Galois> if you are constantly dependent on someone else to tell you math, then you're not learning math.
[01:37:46] <cuppajoeman> I am very new to topology, so sorry if I ask so many questions
[01:37:47] <Z-module> Right, do work on examples yourself, of course. I just think one needs a bit of a start on these examples, sometimes.
[01:38:14] <Galois> the point is that the "open sets" from calculus form an example of a topology from your topology class
[01:38:52] <Z-module> You should definitely work out, purely from axioms for a metric, why the intersection of two open balls in any metric space (or just in R^n if you like) is some union of open balls.
[01:40:13] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I will try that out
[01:40:19] <cuppajoeman> that seems very odd
[01:40:42] <Z-module> by the way, lots of other sources/books only require that intersecting *two* open sets gives an open set. From that you can prove that all finite intersections of them are open.
[01:41:28] <cuppajoeman> Would that be equivalent because of induction?
[01:41:32] <Z-module> remember that to be open, in a metric space, you only need to be some union of open balls -- no restrictions on how many (can be infinitely man), no restrictions on their sizes.,
[01:42:10] <cuppajoeman> Oh so you're saying you can cover any shape with inifinitely many circles, if you can make them infinitely small?
[01:42:40] <Z-module> there are no "infinitely small" things
[01:43:11] <Z-module> but there are balls of all possible radii r, for positive reals r, around any point of the space
[01:43:25] <cuppajoeman> So can you cover a square with balls like this?
[01:43:53] <cuppajoeman> I feel like it's not possible because of the corners
[01:44:04] <cuppajoeman> or wait, any straight line

[01:52:37] <Z-module> so in other words, chopping up the set S into finitely many pieces, and moving them around rigidly and reassembling them to become D, with no holes, no overlaps.

[04:03:24] <qergle> arctan(y) + x * 1/(1+y^2) * dy/dx + 3x^2 = 3(y + x * dy/dx) or so, yes?

[06:41:04] <somiaj> and then add that to the homogeneous solutions which are just c1 e^(-t) + c2 t e^(-t)
[06:41:07] <Panther> The diagonalization of a real symmetric matrix in Chapter 3 corresponds here to the solution of an ODE defined by a self-adjoint operator L in terms of its eigenfunctions, which are the “continuous” analog of the eigenvectors in Chapter 3.

[09:51:40] <droid3> So i think finding a relation with continued fraction to be periodical for cubic  degree 3 algebraic number seems to have to have some special numerators not all equal to one.
[09:52:05] <droid3> But in doing so you can introduce integer or fractional values back into things
[09:53:13] <droid3> So its not so useful unless there some weird formula for the cofficents of the numerator to abide by to weed out the integers, fractions , and quadratic surds and still be periodic for only cubic

[10:12:23] <qergle> say you have y=stuff, then ln(y)=ln(stuff), and then you differentiate to y/y' = d/dx ln(stuff)
[10:12:25] <Guest60> oh wait a second... natural log of a fraction becomes a difference of natural log of the term!
[10:12:46] <qergle> you have several rules
[10:13:00] <qergle> ln(stuff^(1/3)) = (1/3)*ln(stuff)
[10:13:09] <qergle> and ln(a/b)=ln(a)-ln(b), etc
[10:13:14] <Guest60> mm
[10:14:23] <qergle> put all those log properties together to show me what ln(right hand side) becomes in simplest form
[10:15:52] <qergle> up there i meant y'/y
[10:17:23] <pikapika> differential equations are very exciting

[11:21:15] <Guest60> can you do that?
[11:21:30] <somiaj> well |y| = sqrt(y^2), though this still isn't differentiable if y =0
[11:21:46] <somiaj> kinda depends on what you want the formula to look like
[11:21:57] <Guest60> (1/2)*(tan^2(x))^(-1/2) * 2tan(x)*sec^2(x)

[13:46:42] <cadmio> I think that instead of permutations you condier Z_p you could translate the head of p locations e.g [1] rgypw = wrgyp, [2] pwrgy,... and so on
[13:47:03] <riv> so [1] = (1 2 3 4 5) ?

[13:47:44] <cadmio> well Z_p is an additive group so I'd have used [1] + rgypw = wrgyp
[13:49:13] <cadmio> yes it should be that permutation
[13:50:34] <riv> ok, sounds good!

[13:52:11] <cadmio> the same
[13:52:13] <riv> rgypw and pwrgy
[13:52:48] <cadmio> the same

[13:53:43] <cadmio> if the colors are between same letters they are the same cups
[13:54:04] <riv> i don't understand?
[13:55:36] <cadmio> rgypw and rgpwy here in the second configuration  y is between w and r, in the 1st g and p
[13:55:44] <cadmio> so they are different
[13:56:13] <riv> ok good!
[13:56:24] <int-e> what about rgypw and rwpyg?
[13:56:36] <riv> so, the ones that were the same rgypw and wrgyp, rgypw and pwrgy were related by cyclic shifts Z_p permutations
[13:56:45] <riv> and rgypw and rgpwy that were different, were related by S_p permutation

[20:12:58] <riv> So F(a) is the splitting field of some P(X), P(a) = 0 for all conjugates of a since P has coefficients in the base field
[20:13:25] <riv> let Q(X) be the minimal polynomial of a, then again Q(a) = 0 for all conjugates. and by minimality we have Q(X) | P(X)
[20:14:22] <riv> this tells us F(a) is also the splitting field of Q(X)
[20:14:52] <riv> (for example if a = sqrt(3), P(X) could be (X-7)(X-2)(X^2-3) but Q(X) is just X^2-3)
[20:16:56] <rubiksdream> actually i dont see why what isekaijin says needs to be true, just take something like X^3 - 2, which is irreducible as a poly over Q, and adjoin the real cube root of 2 to Q, getting Q(2^{1/3}}, but X^3 - 2 is not going to split in this extension field, because the other two roots it has have non-zero imaginary part, and Q(2^{1/3}) is certainly a subset of R
[20:17:04] <isekaijin> Errr... I expressed myself really badly. What I meant is “In principle, F(a) could be the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of a different element b \in F(a), while still not being the splitting field of a.”
[20:18:02] <isekaijin> Adjoining a cube root of 2 does not give you a spliting field of anything.
[20:18:10] <rubiksdream> oh whoops, sorry you are right

[22:15:09] <reddishblue[m]> Hey, so, I was wondering, Is it possible for a nobody like me from a noname university to do something great in math/computational science?
[22:15:10] <reddishblue[m]> Like, I really have a passion for CompSci (more into theoretical stuff than programming) and math (and also physics but eh) but I didn't get in a good university for bachelors, I really want to  study the topics I love in great depth and hopefully contribute to them. Extremely ambitious for someone like me I know i guess... its like, wherever I look around top people in these fields, I realize that they were extremely good at stuff from
[22:15:10] <reddishblue[m]> school days or even from childhood, like, they had won international competitions, went to top universities like MIT, ivy-leagues etc., done something groundbreaking at a very young age etc. I didn't even participate in any competitions in high school and stuff. It kinda demotivates me from learning stuff when I compare myself to them
[22:19:29] <|smlckz|> do not compare yourself to others
[22:19:47] <|smlckz|> perhaps compare yourself to your past
[22:21:28] <[itchyjunk]> the college you are from doesn't matter. you can publish it to arxiv and such these days
[22:22:07] *** Joins: node1 (~node1@user/node1)
[22:23:07] <jpearse> reddishblue[m]: if you like a particular subject then your university likely has people (like professors) who are also interested in that subject you should talk to about what to do with your passion for the subjects
[22:23:14] <[itchyjunk]> but contributing in those fields is pretty tough I'd imagine

[22:26:23] <[itchyjunk]> trying to find research and then getting interested in it sounds like not the best idea
[22:26:29] <[itchyjunk]> what is it that you are interested in?
[22:26:39] <jpearse> i have been involved in formal methods research in the past
[22:26:41] <[itchyjunk]> just the idea of having names on research papers?

[22:29:41] <jpearse> reddishblue[m]: if you are truly interested in the subject in the modern day and your university has access to research archives then you have a good foundation for mastering some branch of the subject that you want to get into.

[22:59:13] <jpearse> but yeah, basically. just go for it online and try to find someone at your uni who can help if you are stuck trying to figure it out
[22:59:43] <jpearse> even if the compsci prof isn't specialising in that subject they will probably know someone who can assist.
