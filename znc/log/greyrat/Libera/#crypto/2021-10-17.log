[00:03:54] <Alipha> dostoyevsky2: you're sending 3x the info. Only md5 or sha1 would be fine. Though that would be vulnerable to malicious collisions. I'd use sha256 instead
[00:03:55] <maroon> instead of md5 + sha1, might be simpler to just use sha256
[00:04:55] <maroon> so the server is keeping a list of the checksum for all its files?
[00:05:54] <maroon> be famous, be the 1st to come up with an sha256 collision
[00:06:34] <Alipha> Or a double md5+sha1 collision
[00:06:53] <dostoyevsky2> maroon: I could just store the sha256 instead of the file content... decompression is just a question of waiting for your random number generator ;-)
[00:06:58] <maroon> has there been a md5+crc32?
[00:08:24] <dostoyevsky2> I think S3 does it like this: they store the checksum of objects in memory, along with other metadata... and the blob on disk..  And I think they store blobs as fragments of up to 5G... that can make things easier when mirroring the data
[00:08:32] <maroon> i guess there would be, because once you have a collision, you can just append extra blocks, and eventually one of them would cause a crc32 collision
[00:09:41] <Alipha> Does that mean you could do md5 + sha1 by the same method?
[00:09:46] <maroon> i thought i saw that dropbox has globs of 4mb when deciding whether chunks of a file ie zip need to be uploaded

[00:10:23] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, I guess limiting the size will reduce the likelihood of a collision
[00:10:55] <maroon> no, because the md5 and sha1 exploits are just finding a collision, then appending identical chunks to both files
[00:10:57] <dostoyevsky2> also helps with parallel downloading, if you can request a files fragments from different servers, in 4mb chunks
[00:12:58] <maroon> so you could take an md5 or sha1 collision, then try to find identical data that would append to each while causing a crc32 collision - the birthday collision for crc32 would be much easier
[00:14:16] <int-e> maroon: that's one thing that crc32 doesn't do
[00:15:33] <int-e> (if crc32(p1) != crc32(p2) then crc32(p1||s) != crc32(p2||s))
[00:15:55] <maroon> ok, then with all the md5 collisions out there, eventually one of of them should itself be a crc32 collision?
[00:16:19] <int-e> sure, that'll work eventually
[00:16:29] <dostoyevsky2> is md5+crc still commonly used to hash files?
[00:17:01] <maroon> no, but i commonly see md5 as if a quick and dirty crc128

[00:20:35] <maroon> hrm, at the crc polynomial zoo, they don't have anything longer than 64
[00:20:58] <int-e> I guess the thing about crc32 is... adding crc32 will not slow things down in a *generic* collision attack, since it's easy to generate plain texts with a given crc32 checksum. But it does interfere with differential paths and all that
[00:22:29] <int-e> But still, I wouldn't see it as adding protection against collision attacks. Just use a hash where the generic attack is still the best known one. :P
[00:23:02] <maroon> right, and if you want to shorten storage, then you can sha256/truncate=N

[21:54:43] <river> probably tor browser

[21:56:48] <river> what do you want to resist exactly?
[21:56:51] <caveman> tor vs. no tor is making no difference.
[21:57:02] <caveman> JA3 fingerprinting some websites deploy.
[21:57:12] <caveman> https://browserleaks.com/ssl
[21:57:23] <river> why don't you want to be fingerprinted?
[21:58:13] <caveman> because occam's razor.
[21:58:19] <river> that makes no sense
[21:59:12] *** Joins: PsyZeus (~TheLight@user/psyzeus)
[21:59:12] <ms7821> the way to resist fingerprinting is to use a commonly used client to send your requests
[21:59:33] <caveman> the set of assumptions about the world is smaller when you leak less information.  hence more simplicity.  then plug occam's razor in, and it means less error for my world model.
[21:59:40] <ms7821> wat
[22:00:15] <river> i dont understand
[22:00:45] <river> anyway the reason i suggested tor browser is because everyone using tor browser will have the same fingerprint
[22:00:55] <river> so you can't be differentiated based on the fingerprint
[22:01:11] <river> (if enough other people also use it)
[22:01:17] <caveman> the definition "the world is OK if you leak X bits of information" becomes more complex when X grows.
[22:01:40] <ms7821> where on earth does that "definition" come from and what relevance does it have rn?
[22:02:21] <caveman> rn?

[22:03:27] <ms7821> lol
[22:04:33] <river> caveman, bruh
[22:04:35] <ioxzev1z> ( ._.) wat
[22:05:57] <caveman> say that you're assigned the duty to defined worlds where certain conditions are met.  e.g. "define a world where birds can't fly".  you can define a set of worlds that the conditions are true.  you can compress them using shannon's entropy, and get some number of bits.  that number of bits is the average complexity of worlds when that definition is followed.
[22:05:57] *** Quits: river (~river@tilde.team/user/river) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:06:31] <caveman> so far good?
[22:07:17] <ioxzev1z> k
[22:07:56] <caveman> so, that's the complexity of our assumption about the world, given some definition.
[22:09:18] <caveman> now, let's try this:
[22:09:21] <caveman>   (1) define worlds where leaking 0 unnecessary information bits is ok.
[22:09:23] <caveman>   (2) define worlds where leaking 5 unnecessary information bits is ok.
[22:09:25] <caveman> entropy/complexity of definitions based on (2) is higher than that of (1).
[22:09:36] <caveman> this is why you better not leak information when you don't have a reason.  
[22:09:47] <caveman> the default is to not leak excess information.
[22:09:58] <caveman> the default is not "leak all information, unless you're doing something wrong"
[22:11:33] <tolarz> well the default should be to leak as much information as everyone else does :)

[22:16:22] <caveman> which is unfortunately true.
[22:16:41] <caveman> but we must aspire for an even greater world:  a world where no one leaks any excess information.  that's even better.
[22:16:50] <caveman> i.e., a world where you blend for leaking least information.
