[03:35:50] <hajonnes> emanuele6, Thanks a lot. If I want to learn this way of writing commands do you know where I should look?
[03:38:42] <emanuele6> the problem is that -exec runs a command directly, not with a shell; `&' is shell syntax for "run this command in the background", so you need to invoke a shell and run `mimeopen' with the shell so that you can use `&'
[03:39:33] <emanuele6> your original line is interpreted by the shell as: run `find /opt/freemind-bin-max-1.0.1/ -iname '*png' -exec mimeopen {}' in the backgrount and then run a command named `;'

[03:40:45] <emanuele6> but even if you escape the &: find /opt/freemind-bin-max-1.0.1/ -iname '*png' -exec mimeopen {} \& \;
[03:41:07] <emanuele6> you still have the "problem" that `-exec' is not using a shell
[03:41:20] <emanuele6> !-c > so you invoke it using -c 
[03:41:20] <greybot> so you invoke it using -c: bash -c 'bash commands to execute' "$0" "$1" "$2" ... Since "$0" is typically unused, it is often set it to something arbitrary like _

[21:03:06] <chymera> hi guys, is there any easy way to have cron inherit all my user env? I'm stuggling to get this script to work wrt notify-send. https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard/blob/master/bin/mailsync It works if I hard-code DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS â€” but by the looks of that path and that it's under /tmp I assume it's going to change at some point
[21:03:07] <checkbot> chymera: I think the problem is on line 62. This word is constant. Did you forget the $ on a variable? See 8 issues on https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb5187
[21:03:35] <chymera> checkbot: no, but thank you

[21:03:59] <izabera> smarts
[21:06:15] <chymera> any ideas re getting cron to just inherit my user env? `source ${HOME}/.bash_profile` also didn't do it

[21:33:43] <greybot> Cron is used for scheduling recurring jobs. at(1) is used for scheduling one-time jobs. crontab -e, /etc/crontab or /etc/periodic are places where you can configure jobs. The most common problems with cron jobs include %'s in a crontab (escape with backslash: date +\%Y), commands that rely on $DISPLAY, and having a different environment (eg. PATH/SHELL). See man 5 crontab.

Can I write the script in such a way that some auxiliary private functions are not imported when I source the script?

[23:13:35] <MDingas-> does this answer my question? I don't think so

[23:15:45] <MDingas-> fair enough. The use case is that I write a bunch of functions in a script, and then i use them interactively in the shell to interactively run them to perform some task
[23:16:01] <MDingas-> so when i want to use them i just do 'source functions.sh'
[23:16:10] <MDingas-> but this imports all functions, even ones i want to keep private
[23:16:12] *** Joins: thebombzen (~thebombze@67.194.1.214)
[23:16:16] <Soliton> source does not work in sh.
[23:16:27] <Soliton> you should use .
[23:16:51] <greycat> I'm guessing the error here is the file extension, not the command
[23:18:01] <Soliton> anyway, do you expect your private functions to still be called? why are they in the file at all?
[23:20:10] <MDingas-> my intent is my sourcing the file, the user in the interactive shell gets to use these public functions i gave him
[23:20:30] <Soliton> and those functions call the private functions?
[23:20:34] <MDingas-> indeed
[23:20:44] <Soliton> so how should that work if they are not defined?
[23:21:14] <greycat> So you have a file, and in this file there are 4 functions and then some code.  If the file is executed as a script, it should just run the code normally.  If it's sourced, only the first two functions should be defined, and then it should stop reading before it defines the other 2 funcs or runs the code.  Yes?  The FAQ seems appropriate.
[23:21:20] <MDingas-> well, it works in programming languages does it not? I can import a library whose public functions can utilize private functions that cannot be called from external programs
[23:21:51] <MDingas-> the problem is that if they are not read, they cannot be used by the public functions

[23:22:02] <greycat> Are you saying you also need to provide "stub" versions of the 2 missing functions for the "sourced" case?  Then do that.
[23:22:03] <Soliton> then you should use those programming languages.
[23:22:13] <Soliton> bash does not work that way.
[23:22:19] <emanuele6> bash doesn't have private functions it does not even have local functions :(

[23:24:03] <Soliton> you need to know the secret handshake to call them?

[23:24:24] <MDingas-> i would like the sourcing not to include the "private" functions for interactive use

[23:28:06] <justsomeguy> Bash is pretty primitive as a programming language.

[23:40:37] <dcand> actually isn't a problem i am having
[23:40:57] <dcand> i saw 9front's man page for git lists git's subcommand as git/subcommand
[23:41:08] <dcand> wondered if it works on bash
[23:41:46] <greycat> if you write a bash script that accepts subcommand names as its first argument, you can search for those in a directory that you configure for this purpose, but it won't be done by $PATH

[23:44:00] <euouae> I want to search all instances of $word::$word in a file
[23:44:02] <dcand> i just checked, sub/foo works on rc
[23:44:21] <euouae> where $word repeats. so things like Foo::Foo should come up, but not Foo::Bar
[23:44:32] <dcand> so its feature of rc
[23:44:39] <greycat> euouae: BRE has backreferences, ERE does not, so you will need to use BRE or another tool that has them
[23:44:53] <euouae> thanks greycat , what does BRE stand for?
[23:44:55] <greycat> !bre

[23:45:00] <greycat> e.g. "grep"
[23:45:21] <euouae> ty I think I can take it from here, look up backreferences and grep  
[23:46:33] <greycat> # printf %s\\n Foo::Bar Foo::Foo Foo:Foo | grep '\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\}\)::\1'
[23:46:34] *** Parts: dcand (~dcand@user/dcand) ()
[23:46:35] <shbot> greycat: Foo::Foo
[23:46:52] <greycat> might need it a little fancier to avoid false positives like Foo::Foot
[23:47:13] <phy1729> ^ and $
[23:47:27] <greycat> it's not clear what the input actually looks like
[23:47:32] <phy1729> Hrm guess not
[23:47:32] <euouae> Can you use \w instead of [:alpha:]?
[23:47:41] <greycat> BRE has no \w
[23:47:51] <greycat> your particular flavor of grep might add that as an extension
[23:48:07] <euouae> Got it greycat, ok so we're using alpha then

[23:48:54] <euouae> how about 'Foo::Foo ' with a space?
[23:49:14] <euouae> Your stuff confuses me a bit, not sure wht you're doing {1,}
[23:49:23] <greycat> BRE has no + either
[23:49:32] <greycat> \{1,\} is the BRE version of +
[23:49:41] <euouae> One or more, ah got you 
[23:50:34] <euouae> awesome, thank you

[23:56:08] <earnestly> I do like how much more expressive it is over +
[23:56:25] <earnestly> two or more, three or more, four or five, etc.
