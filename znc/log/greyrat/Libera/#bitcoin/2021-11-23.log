[15:09:16] <k3tan> why then does the service file point to /usr/bin/bitcoind
[15:09:42] <k3tan> also, -daemonwait doesn't actually work (or even exist, afaik)
[15:10:21] <k3tan> and the conf= and datadir= are not even close to being in the right place. when you install bitcoin, the default datadir is /home/username/.bitcoin

[20:40:15] <jamesecombs> what are you currently workin on?
[20:40:34] <while> just curious, for a given bitcoin address, why would bitcoin core give an empty result ("[]") for listunspent for a given address while getreceivedbyaddress return a positive amount, suggesting the presence of unspent transaction being spendable by that address's private key in the form of a signature?
[20:41:33] <jamesecombs> interesting
[20:41:41] <jamesecombs> are you getting this info from cmd?
[20:42:08] <jamesecombs> does the address indeed have UTXOs?
[20:42:31] <while> yes `bitcoin-cli listunspent 0 99999 '["address here"]'` vs `bitcoin-cli getreceivedbyaddress 'same address'`
[20:43:05] <while> let me try the call for listing utxo's
[20:43:13] <jamesecombs> pardon for clarifying, does the address have any UTXO's you know of
[20:45:05] <while> not to sound like a newbie, but upon further inspection, I don't think it does
[20:45:52] <jamesecombs> that may be the issue. bizzare that getreceivedbyaddress is coming up positive
