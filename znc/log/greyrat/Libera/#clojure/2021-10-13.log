[21:28:42] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Maybe the whole ordeal gave publicity to channels. That would be unfortunate tho
[21:29:26] <Para> Would be kinda funny if that sparked the uptrend of IRC again.
[21:29:38] <Para> (nah, won't happen but one can dream)
[21:32:00] <shem> i, for one, welcome another swarm of retronerds
[21:33:09] <shem> well, perchance a wavelet
[21:33:21] <Para> The next wave of hipsterism could cyberhipsters who only use 80s tech.
[21:33:49] <yeik-the-spik[m]> IRC nowadays just looks like another messaging app. If you use it thought matrix
[21:34:10] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I understood people looking at me funny when I was IRCing through emacs
[21:34:26] <yeik-the-spik[m]> But the matrix client just looks "normal"
[21:35:23] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I mean to say. It does not look retro. How does it appeal to hipsters? How does it not appeal to "non-tech" people?

[21:45:03] <technomancy> it appeals to me because A) the extremely wide selection of clients and B) I can interface with it to make my own bots and stuff in like ten lines of code and C) people who like Electron "modern" UIs can also participate in conversations.
[21:45:29] <technomancy> I don't care at all about matrix except that it helps prevent people from ditching for discord or slack or some other godforsaken hellhole
[21:48:55] <shem> yeik-the-spik[m]: i agree, i've glimpsed irc through matrix and it's another channel, a room, a site. the retro appeal comes when you use it with the traditional command line clients
[21:53:05] *** Joins: atw (~user@dynamic-089-014-041-169.89.14.pool.telefonica.de)
[21:55:53] <shem> i occasionally use irc with an actual vt220 glass tty, and i certainly then concentrate more on the substance than the flair
[21:56:39] <technomancy> jelly
[21:59:18] <shem> lemon jelly?
[21:59:45] <technomancy> why not
[21:59:54] <technomancy> (what I meant was I'm jealous)
[22:00:56] <shem> the keyboard on a vt220 is hideously spongy but otherwise it's lovely
[22:01:00] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I am using though matrix web right now. I don't really know why. This computer has my utmost spectrum set-up (thinkpad x220, arch linux with dwm, emacs as editor) but I am connecting to irc through a web app.
[22:02:15] <Para> Because it's easy and convenient?
[22:02:39] <technomancy> this is a no-clientshaming zone
[22:03:06] <technomancy> however if you are looking for ways to save memory and CPU, weechat's matrix client is quite good
[22:04:01] <Para> That's a curious pile of turtles.
[22:04:39] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: More convinient than emacs? I dont know...
[22:04:51] <Para> I don't think I've ever even started emacs.
[22:05:11] <Para> I'm sort of semimotivated to learn either emacs or Cursive properly by the end of this year though.
[22:05:23] <yeik-the-spik[m]> technomancy: I will check it out. thanks for the recommendation
[22:05:32] <Para> I do have this dream that I would have a remote machine I could ssh into and have all my work crap in the cloud instead of locally.
[22:05:48] <technomancy> bonus points: weechat also works for slack, which saves me a huge amount of headache at work.
[22:06:08] <Para> weechat's design also makes sense on high level
[22:06:25] <Para> Coming from irssi's cryptic this-is-how-it-just-is it was very refreshing.
[22:06:34] <technomancy> Para: I kind of do that; my work machine is a virtualbox that runs on a macbook sitting in a closet that work sent me for compliance reasons but I've never touched it since the last mandated security update; I just connect over SSH from more pleasant computers.
[22:06:40] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Para: I am really happy I learnt emacs when at uni. It definitely paid off at work. Specially when I had to use windows. Although emacs on windows is a  can of worms. But better than using windows
[22:07:15] <Para> I'm 36 very soon, my learning curve at this point looks like the before picture in certain blue pill ad.
[22:07:46] * jeaye runs weechat in tmux on a Digital Ocean droplet which is already running a bunch of other things.
[22:07:58] <jeaye> Easy to SSH in and attach to the tmux session.
[22:09:22] <shem> seems i'm an outlier here, i like my wayland-gtk emacs very local indeed, pull stuff in for development and then push stuff into the cold void

[22:12:18] <Para> I'm young enough that I've always used GUI OSes, which is my personal hindrance in all these things :) It's kinda curious to be on that edge.
[22:12:36] <Para> I lack a lot of the implicit awareness needed to understand the terminal stack and ordering
[22:13:29] <technomancy> eh; tmux is just a window manager with some missing features
[22:14:35] <jeaye> Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill?
[22:14:40] <Para> Which doesn't practically say much to me, the "why" part is gone.
[22:14:48] <Para> But that's for me to google :)
[22:15:07] <technomancy> well, I guess the biggest difference is you can't detach and reattach a conventional WM
[22:15:24] <technomancy> you can run it over SSH with X forwarding, but without detach/reattach it's a major headache
[22:16:10] <Para> And what is X, why would I want to forward it...this is the unix turtle pile I've never gotten familiar with properly :)
[22:16:30] <shem> i use tmux with servers and irc but for actual dev stuff i like immediate response
[22:16:30] <jeaye> tmux is limited, as a WM, but escape sequences. The way I use my WM (i3) is not possible with tmux, since the keys I press don't generate escape sequences which tmux can use.
[22:16:45] <Para> I know the stuff on high level but not on practical. This is curious to me even, I literally started my computering in the summer 1995 with brand new PC with Win95.
[22:16:47] <technomancy> Para: oh haha, well I just mean you can run GUI programs remotely over SSH too, not just command-line ones.
[22:17:02] <jeaye> I'd be quite frustrated if I tried to use tmux for anything more than a means of detaching/attaching over SSH.
[22:17:32] <jeaye> suckless folks who suggest it for local WMgmt are masochistic.
[22:18:22] <jeaye> s/but escape/by escape/
[22:18:44] <technomancy> jeaye: well, tmux as a window manager is not very useful because you can't run firefox inside it, and to an emacs user the point of a window manager is to have a place to put your non-emacs programs. =)
[22:18:51] <shem> luckily, whatever we started with, we can try alternatives
[22:19:30] * jeaye is a vim user; his WM is a separate tool which does its job well.
[22:22:32] <v3ga> xmonad is the one true window manager...
[22:23:05] <technomancy> xmonad is by far the best of the non-emacs WMs I've tried; I love how it's under 2kloc
[22:24:11] <shem> i find it strangely appealing that some core parts of xmonad were proven to function to the spec by coq
[22:24:16] <jeaye> xmonad's a good one.
[22:25:40] <jeaye> I landed on i3wm after trying so many other tiling WMs. scrotwm (now called spectrwm), dwm, awesome, xmonad, ratpoison, etc.
[22:28:08] <jeaye> Also made my own tiler, before finding i3, which ended up being a worse version of i3. Worked out well. ^_^
[22:28:37] <Para> That's also another thing, emacs being everything but a text editor.
[22:29:11] <Para> Like...what am I really supposed to run if I want to use emacs and IRC remotely from the same remote session? I don't want options, I want definitive solutions :)
[22:29:15] <jeaye> That's why people use evil mode, I suppose.
[22:29:21] <Para> Gnome or KDE; who cares, I want the one that works.
[22:31:52] <technomancy> Para: what do you mean using emacs and IRC remotely from the same session?
[22:32:01] <technomancy> that seems contradictory
[22:32:37] <technomancy> honestly keeping a separate emacs instance just for IRC channels has worked really well for me over the years and I don't see a lot of benefit in merging
[22:32:40] <Para> That's a major part of the whole problem of lacking proper understanding of what the stack is meant to be.
[22:33:30] <Para> Having too many options without definitive answers makes majority of people, me including, to simply shut off and go elsewhere.
[22:33:41] <technomancy> the problem is I take so much of this stuff for granted that I don't even know how to explain it to someone who's unfamiliar with emacs
[22:33:55] <Para> Not having a definitive opinion is a major sign of something not being ready to use.
[22:34:18] <technomancy> like I forget that most people don't think of "there's no way to immediately view and edit the source for any given command in their OS" as a show-stopping bug
[22:34:58] <technomancy> Para: that's a weird definition of "ready"; sounds more like a monopoly to me
[22:35:25] <technomancy> like is the web more "ready" now than it was in 2013 because every program is just an increasingly-unconvincing skin around chrome?
[22:35:53] <Para> If it's easy to access and use and doesn't absolutely kill my computer, then sure.
[22:36:29] <technomancy> to me a monopoly is a sign of an ecosystem in collapse
[22:36:44] <Para> I can take that as well. It might be natural even.
[22:36:56] <Para> Like how populations of predators and preys work in nature over years.
