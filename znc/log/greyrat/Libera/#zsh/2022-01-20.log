[00:36:17] <irc_user> Is there a way to change my prompt color depending on whether `git status --porcelain` outputs anything or not?
[00:36:35] <Mikachu> yes
[00:37:01] <irc_user> Would you be able to point me in the right direction?
[00:37:44] <Mikachu> you can check out the vcs_info docs in man zshcontrib (or man zshall), or just look at the precmd hook if you want to do it more manually
[00:37:45] *** Joins: frm_ (~frm@user/frm)
[00:39:29] <irc_user> ohh, is precmd what gets called every time a new prompt is generated?

[00:53:31] *** Joins: zenof (~zenofthin@88.130.155.166)
[00:55:14] <irc_user> Ah that makes sense, so `[[ -d .git && -n $(git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null) ]]`, thank you.
[00:57:36] <Hello72> also that will only work in the repository root, and also it's probably not that efficient to ask git to generate the whole list if you only want to know if it's non-empty
[00:57:58] <Mikachu> i'm not immediately aware of some way to ask git for "is there any non-zero change, don't care how much"
[00:58:13] <Hello72> and because it's synchronous that will noticeably delay your prompt in large repositories
[01:02:04] <irc_user> Hello72: I see, thank you. I don't usually like flashy stuff so I was just going to test out this rudimentary approach to see if I liked it to begin with.
[01:02:25] <irc_user> I guess I could remove the `-d .git` to solve the repo root problem
[01:03:09] <Mikachu> looking forward to your re-implementation of vcs_info ;)
[01:04:19] <irc_user> LOL. Well I haven't found anything in vcs_info that accounted for any non-zero change as you mentioned

[01:05:21] *** Joins: w0ng (~w0ng@185.218.127.41)
[01:06:08] <irc_user> dirty tree == any non-zero change?
[01:06:16] <Mikachu> yeah
[01:06:25] <irc_user> Oh
[01:06:56] <Mikachu> it appears to use git diff --no-ext-diff --ignore-submodules=dirty --quiet --exit-code
[01:07:07] <Mikachu> perhaps that is smart enough to stop on any change
[01:08:25] <Mikachu> of course, it will still be slow if the change is "last" in the files checked
[01:10:32] *** Quits: zenof (~zenofthin@88.130.155.166) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:11:02] <Mikachu> for me in the linux git tree with cold cache, git diff first run takes 8.5s, second run takes 0.07s, after that (without clearing caches again) git status --porcelain still takes 1.28s additional, and rerunning that is then down to 0.06s
[01:11:11] <Mikachu> so git diff does exit faster than git status
[01:11:28] <Mikachu> (i have one modified file)
[01:12:06] <irc_user> Thanks for sharing, I wonder how diff could be faster than status
[01:12:33] <Mikachu> since it uses --quiet --exit-code it is only checking for any changes, and as soon as it finds one it will quit without checking more files
[01:12:46] <Mikachu> but status will collect a list of all changed files
[01:13:23] <Mikachu> it would make some sense to have status --quiet --exit-code but git doesn't usually make sense
[01:13:24] <irc_user> Ohh I thought you used just `git diff` I see.
[01:13:33] <Mikachu> yeah i was just abbreviating the previous commands
[01:14:20] <irc_user> By first run taking 8.5 seconds, is that the first time *ever*, after which git caches something causing all future runs to be quicker?
[01:14:51] *** Joins: emanuele6 (~emanuele6@user/emanuele6)
[01:15:32] <irc_user> or does git frequently auto clear that cache or something
[01:17:12] <Mikachu> the only cache involved is the operating system cache
[01:17:33] <Mikachu> git probably stats every file in the work tree to see if the timestamp matches the index, if so it doesn't need to read the file at all
[01:17:54] <Mikachu> if it needs to generate a new index it will probably take longer
[01:18:02] <Mikachu> but that shouldn't normally happen

[01:29:07] <irc_user> I see, thank you. Why does everyone I talk to on here know so much about everything lol.
[01:29:22] <irc_user> `git diff --no-ext-diff --ignore-submodules=dirty --quiet --exit-code 2>/dev/null; if [[ $? -eq 1 ]]; then` This appears to work well
[01:29:44] <Mikachu> you can just use the command directly as the condition
[01:29:53] <Mikachu> if git diff ...; then
[01:30:14] <Mikachu> (no practical difference)
[01:31:24] *** Quits: Torr (~Torr@user/torr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:31:59] <irc_user> The issue is that if I use it not in a git repository, the exit code is neither 0 nor 1, so I only want to check for 1 specifically.
[01:32:00] *** Joins: Torr (~Torr@user/torr)
[01:32:10] <Mikachu> ah okay, that makes sense
[01:33:48] <irc_user> Is using `$?` fine here? ' I wasn't able to get it to work inside of the `[[ ]]`
[01:34:07] <Mikachu> what do you mean?
[01:34:25] <Mikachu> if you need to check for exactly 1 then you do need the separate [[ $? -eq 1 ]] check as you had originally
[01:35:40] <irc_user> I meant as opposed to something like `[[ git diff --no-ext-diff --ignore-submodules=dirty --quiet --exit-code 2>/dev/null -eq 1 ]]`
[01:36:04] <Mikachu> ah yeah that won't work
[01:36:11] <Mikachu> [[ itself returns an exit status that is checked by if
[01:36:14] <irc_user> Because `$?` depends on the last command being correct, and I know it's synchronous, but I don't code in sh often so I'm second guessing stuff

[01:37:06] <Mikachu> [[ ]] is not syntax specific to "if", you can use it wherever you want, and you can use any command as a condition for "if"
[01:38:24] <irc_user> I see. I meant that I was using `$?` because the `-eq` gets considered as a flag to `git`, so I couldn't put it inside of the brackets, but I didn't know if that was a robust solution.
[01:38:41] <Mikachu> right, you can't put commands inside [[ ]] at all
[01:38:50] <Mikachu> it should work perfectly fine as you wrote it

[19:23:25] <zenof> hey there. is there an elegant solution to read from either a file given as argument OR stdin in a shellscript, something like  ... file=${1:-/dev/stdin} ... but how to handle other arguments then?
[19:25:25] <llua> need more context about the concern
[19:27:05] <Soliton> put optional arguments last.
[19:29:39] <zenof> well, I would like to handle several cases, '$ myScript somefile.txt' but also '$  myScript -n 10 somefile.txt' and '$  myScript -n 10 -'  and '$  myScript -' with - for stdin
[19:32:02] <llua> the normal option parsing would process -n and it's argument leaving the remaining operands to do as you please
[19:33:48] <zenof> and then I would have to see if a file name is given (then use this) , or an explicit '-'  or nothing is given and then use stdin ?
[19:34:23] <llua> yeah
[19:36:09] <zenof> very much straight forward then, though I thought there could be a nicer solution... what ever nicer in that context means ;)

[19:52:26] <phy1729> argparse doesn't expose enough info to automatically generate a completer from it's argument parser object, so you can't do something like https://github.com/phy1729/click_completion_zsh
[19:54:00] <esc> phy1729: no I did it all manually and all the comments are out of date, people still use it because there is no alternative
[19:55:48] <esc> but something seems to be an issue with how the module is supposed to be initialized, so many people seem to have issues with this.
[19:56:24] <esc> I have no idea, I wrote this completion many years ago and I am not well versed enough in zsh to fix these issues.
[19:56:36] <esc> it seems to be working well for many people, however
[20:00:41] <llua> https://github.com/esc/conda-zsh-completion/issues/38 dude just seems confused
[20:01:46] <esc> llua: can you --verbose
[20:01:51] <esc> :)
[20:03:36] <llua> for the compsys to notice a completer, it has to be in fpath before compinit is ran. its even correctly documented here https://github.com/esc/conda-zsh-completion/blob/master/_conda#L15-L22
[20:05:47] <llua> after being bootstrapped, you can use compdef to add addtional ones but ideally you setup fpath as desired, then call compinit
[20:08:47] <llua> setup fpath completely that is, then call compinit; once.

[20:14:59] <llua> all compinit is really doing is defining the compdef function, then search for files in fpath that begins with _ and has a magic comment #compdef. so if you extend fpath after compinit is ran. nothing of interest will happen within the compsys
