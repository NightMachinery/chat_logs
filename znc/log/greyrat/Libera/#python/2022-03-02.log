[02:04:29] <exarkun> zerosum: All of your examples have one key/value pair per dictionary.  Do values always look like that?
[02:04:40] <nedbat> pfloyd: sounds like you should parse the whole yaml file, then manipulate the python dicts/lists/etc.
[02:04:53] <exarkun> zerosum: Could an element be {'192.168.1.0/24': '172.16.0.0/24', '172.16.0.0/24': '192.168.1.0/24'}?
[02:05:02] *** Joins: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1)
[02:05:44] <pfloyd> nedbat: the exact structure of the YAML needs to be rather loose, or I'd do that, yeah. I think I might just load the file into a string and reg.sub for each of the replacement(s) and create the yaml object from the modified string
[02:06:19] <nedbat> pfloyd: do you mean something like, "i need to adjust strings no matter where they appear in the data"?
[02:07:08] <exarkun> using a regular expression will definitely be broken.  yaml is not a regular grammar.
[02:07:11] <zerosum> exarkun just realized that's not a very accurate example, I repasted with something more accurate: https://bpa.st/YE2Q, and yeah they all have one key/value pair per dictionary
[02:07:37] <exarkun> zerosum: Okay.  So how would you go from a dictionary with one element to a `dict_key` and `dict_value` to use in your comparison?
[02:08:20] <pfloyd> nedbat: yes, ideally only in lists or values of keys but I am willing to keep it simple and allow replacement anywhere if it simplifies the solution. which I think given the small size of the yaml files is to just read the file into a string, manipulate it and safe_load on that modified string
[02:08:57] <pfloyd> exarkun: for the purposes of what I'm doing, and given the need to not adhere to a strict structure in the YAML, it's the best I can hope for
[02:08:58] <nedbat> pfloyd: you'd have to be careful not to break the yaml with the regex.
[02:09:16] <exarkun> pfloyd: yaml supports a limited number of types.  once you load the whole document, it should be easy to visit all of the values and substitute as desired - safely.
[02:09:18] <pfloyd> yep, but as they say garbage in / garbage out
[02:09:22] <nedbat> pfloyd: your other option is to use a recursive function that walks the structure, making changes as it goes.

[03:44:52] <sharpertool> I'd like to be able to define, at a 'class level' a 'task' method. I can easily just define a generic named "def task_method(...)" and be done with it, but I'd kind of like that method to be defined as a more specific name. I wanted to configure this 'named method' with a class variable, but, I can't do something like "task_method = self.do_this_task", or, "task_method = __class__.do_this-task".

[03:57:10] <whoami97> Hi
[03:57:11] <nedbat> sharpertool: you want one base class, then subclasses, each with their own more specific name?
[03:57:41] <sharpertool> This is kind of 'guilding the lilly' really. I can just override "task_method" and be done with it, which is what did. Also, I can override __init__ and set `self.task_method = self.my_special_method`
[03:57:45] <sharpertool> tht works.

[04:31:13] <sveinse> It's actually worth telling: I worked in a company making special microwave communication equipment that had a very special protocol. Everything low-level were written in C++. However prototyping in C++ is tedious, so we selected to integrate the low-level comms with higher level Py. Py had by far the easiest C integration, so that wasn't that difficult. The end result is that this enabled high-level
[04:31:19] <sveinse> protocol testing and experimentation in Py, which sped up the development pace enormously.

[06:02:04] <Jong> SnoopJ  you can select blobs from a sqlite db and then run np.frombuffer(record)
[06:03:27] <SnoopJ> Jong, so where does np.load() come into it? Do you store serialized arrays this way, too?
[06:04:22] <blei> you can marshall the array to oracle berkeley db
[06:04:30] <blei> retrieval should be faster than sqlite
[06:05:35] <Jong> The load-side-code np.load would be used if the save-side-code np.save was used.  The load-side-code np.frombuffer would be used if the save-side-code stored the numpy array to a sqlite blob
[06:06:00] <blei> its safe to say that no one has benchmarked that
[06:06:37] <AhmedAmerican> any recommendation for reading `pdf` from `response.text` or `response.content` ?
[06:06:38] <Jong> SnoopJ  it's a pair. The save and load code either using numpy load save code or the load/save code used to work with sqlite.

[13:11:08] <Jong> A minor annoyance is when there are two choices a variable can take such as if a variable is either "test" or "train" and if only one is checked in an if else statement, such as if mode == "test":  [bunch of code here] else: [bunch of other code here].  It would be visually satisfying if there was a way I could make it more effortless to associate the else with mode == "train".   I could use an elif, but the problem is that removes the
[13:11:08] <Jong>  communication that always of the two paths (if body path or else body path) is taken and never are they both skipped.   Has anyone else ever wondered how to resolve this?

[21:22:26] <twb> bjs: then you need to buy a new computer
[21:22:29] <bjs> the problem is that you can't really have that coroutine part of the same event loop, as asyncio isn't designed to have tasks running in different threads

[22:09:36] <Guest92> Suppose a json file (randomly picked: https://gist.github.com/gcollazo/884a489a50aec7b53765405f40c6fbd1) which gets read into a Py dictionary. I’d like to: search a given substring (eg. “:image”) and return the section/list it is part of (in this case, that would be lines 68-71). Is there a straightforward way of doing this? (besides regex)

[23:12:51] <BinarySavior> for example, `git pull domain.net` would download `readme.txt`

[23:29:01] <BinarySavior> EdFletcher that's exactly why I want to change it to wget... because `git clone` doesn't really carry the same connotation as `git pull` and `git pull` is basically the wrong command
