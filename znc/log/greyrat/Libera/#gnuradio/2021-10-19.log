[00:49:15] <flash[m]> I changed an OOT block ctor to take a structure rather than a zillion arguments. I inadvertently broke the GRC integration
[00:49:24] <flash[m]> I don't use GRC; is there a place to look for what to fix?

[00:55:20] <DerekKozel[m]> In the oot
[00:56:45] <DerekKozel[m]> If it's a C++ block and you're using the Python access then the pybind wrapping, or for 3.8 the swig (so sorry)
[00:57:06] <flash[m]> yes, still in 3.8, in this case
[00:57:57] <flash[m]> I see the templats: make: which looks like the ctor call. How do I set up a structure in the yaml?
[00:58:08] <DerekKozel[m]> You may change your mind about the value of changing the API of you still need Python access
[00:58:48] <DerekKozel[m]> You'll need to fix the Python automatic wrapping first, and SWIG is notoriously less than fun
[00:58:57] <flash[m]> definitely a coin toss ... it had so many defaulted parameters and I changed it in a way that could fail silently, so I thought the API breakage was worth it
[00:59:23] <flash[m]> are the .i files auto-generated or maintained?
[00:59:27] <DerekKozel[m]> You'll have to wrap the struct class into Python

[01:00:38] <DerekKozel[m]> Me
[01:01:21] <flash[m]> there was a time where we had embedded python calling C++ shared library from the executable

[01:20:00] <flash[m]> it looks like what I need is more than a simple function call, but rather a code block that populates the structure and passes it.
[01:20:16] <flash[m]> I can resurrect the knowledge of how to do that in SWIG, but how does the yaml play?
[01:26:24] <willcode4[m]> flash: Easier to use a lot of setters, and leave most params out of the ctor.

[17:29:41] <Guest5950> Hey all, I am looking for a method to average numbers. Lets say I have numbers in range(0,100). I want to average first 10 nummbers and then second average will be from 11 to 20, 3rd average from 21 to 30 and so on. 
[17:29:59] <Guest5950> Can I implement this using moving average block. 
[17:30:44] <Guest5950> I know moving average is different concept, and is about calculating average with moving time points. 
[17:33:41] <tnt> You can use a decimating FIR filter and set decimation to 10 and the taps to [0.1, 0,1, ... ] ( 10 times 0.1 )
[17:34:29] <tnt> you could do it with a moving average and a keep 1 in N block but that'd be a waste because you would be computing 9 averages just to drop them right after ...
[17:37:37] <Guest5950> tnt sorry, I missed your point on moving average and keep 1 in N block 
[17:38:21] <Guest5950> To add my original question, I want to store the averaged values in a location using vector sink.

[21:30:11] <DerekKozel[m]> The porting guides are sequential, but not clear that's part of the issue
[21:31:28] <mwk088[m]> yes, I used the steps from 3.8 to get to 3.9
[21:33:19] <mwk088[m]> I keep thinking the Pybind C++ file being generated isn't quite right 
[21:33:25] <DerekKozel[m]> Ok. can you import the OOT from python outside of grc? Possibly there's an incomplete binding of the wifi module?
[21:35:50] <mwk088[m]> So, I don't see my block if I do python3 -> import(wifi) -> dir(wifi)
[21:38:32] <mwk088[m]> and that error I first showed comes when trying to execute my flowgraph containing the ParamMgr block

[21:41:31] <DerekKozel[m]> I don't know I have any useful advice without poking around at it. My first guesses are lack of binding, incomplete bindings, or the resulting c++ to Python binding isn't installed or visible (ldconfig)

[21:56:38] <DerekKozel[m]> look to see if there's a wifi_parammgr binding file (or similar)
[21:56:52] <DerekKozel[m]> and try running python3 there and importing wifi_parammgr

[22:01:24] <Hash[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "Hash: The PDU Preamble F has..." <- Thatâ€™s a good question, I was so happy it worked at midnight I might have missed something critical.
[22:01:31] <mwk088[m]> I tried it and keep getting ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wifi_ParamMgr_python'
[22:02:07] <geraman21[m]> Hello everyone, I have a .dat file in an interleaved I&Q 16-bit integer format sampled with 4MHz. When trying to use it in a source block with type complex, I am not getting the data inside. Is there anyway to use this file as a source ?
[22:04:01] <geraman21[m]> mwk088: Did you try removing your build directory and cmake make again ? Binding files should be generated automatically then, by default at least. 
[22:07:02] <DerekKozel[m]> Or is there some error message in addition to the ModuleNotFound? Right now I'm expecting that there's some error and hoping that this will show more detail
[22:10:06] <willcode4[m]> geraman21: What does "not getting the data inside" mean?
[22:10:46] <mait[m]> geraman21 the idiom I use is to set the file source to short output, followed by an IShort To Complex block, then a Multiply Const block to scale.
[22:12:50] <geraman21[m]> willcode4: Its hard to explain, values from 0 to -1 I believe. 
[22:13:16] <geraman21[m]> mait: Let me try !
[22:14:22] *** Joins: dd_ (dd_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/dd/x-95652672)
[22:14:28] <willcode4[m]> There is a scale factor in the IShort To Complex, so the Multiply Const should not be needed.
[22:15:16] *** Acinonyx__ is now known as Acinonyx
[22:16:11] <geraman21[m]> mait: That worked !
[22:19:19] <mait[m]> willcode4 yeah, with 3.9. But I've been doing it a while, and even that block in 3.8 versions did not scale.
[22:19:45] <geraman21[m]> So to be clear, source is 16 bit, when I connect the file source with iShort to complex, it will interleve I and Q values into gr_complex type correct ?
[22:20:08] <geraman21[m]> s/source/short/
[22:20:58] <mait[m]> Yup.
[22:23:27] <geraman21[m]> mait: Thanks !
[22:25:13] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[22:26:18] <mait[m]> This is for the common case where the short samples are signed integers. Sometimes I have seen data scaled into an unsigned short, which just needs a bit more math to scale into a float.
[22:31:06] <mwk088[m]> Ok, I deleted the build folder, reran cmake and tried the same steps with the same ModuleNotFoundError
[22:33:19] <geraman21[m]> mwk088: do you see your module in GRC ?
[22:34:38] <mwk088[m]> yes
[22:35:22] <geraman21[m]> You have to check in which python dist folder you install your module vs where GR is looking at
[22:35:44] <geraman21[m]> So during sudo make install, look where it installs it 
[22:50:01] <mwk088[m]> ok, looks everything is going into python3.8 dist folder, which is correct.
[22:50:50] <geraman21[m]> mwk088: Are you on mac or Linux ?
[22:51:44] <mwk088[m]> linux, working out of a centos 8.4 docker container
[22:52:21] <funkylab[m]> on centos, `dist-packages` is typically **not** part of PYTHONPATH.
[22:54:01] <mwk088[m]> I source a setup_env file which sets the python paths
