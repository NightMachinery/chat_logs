[01:03:59] <Blondie101010> velix:  you can still use it
[01:04:19] <velix> Blondie101010: I know, but people always dislike the movement of the pointer ;)
[01:05:01] <velix> Blondie101010: but count()/sizeof(), array_slice() or array_get_last_key (don't know the right name) might be costy, too :)
[01:05:13] <stenno> you should probably not use that pointer in the first place
[01:05:20] <stenno> it will just lead to spaghetti code
[01:05:22] <Blondie101010> take good note of this:  the first thing that matters is that the code works, and then you look for common good programming principles, and those DO NOT include restrictions on array operations
[01:05:36] <Blondie101010> stenno:  don't encourage him :)
[01:05:54] <stenno> bad timing
[01:06:04] <velix> stenno: But I just want the last entry of an array...
[01:06:15] <velix> I'm not using any pointers ;)
[01:06:56] <velix> end($array()) also makes a semantic sense ;)
[01:07:07] <velix> end($arr)
[01:07:25] <__adrian> "people always dislike the movement of the pointer" this isn't really a valid concern anymore
[01:07:27] <Blondie101010> please stop...  if you need the last entry then get it
[01:07:32] <stenno> just use slice or $array[count($array) - 1]
[01:07:40] <stenno> array_slice
[01:07:42] <Blondie101010> that's NOT better
[01:07:43] <__adrian> you should be using foreach() to iterate an array; so pointer position doesn't matter
[01:08:21] <Blondie101010> `end()` exists for valid reasons
[01:08:22] <__adrian> if you need the last item, then end()
[01:08:42] <stenno> yay side effects for array access, amazing
[01:08:42] <__adrian> if your code breaks because you used end() then it's probably a different problem that you should also solve
[01:08:52] * Blondie101010 nods
[01:09:08] <__adrian> end() is not aside effect of array access
[01:09:14] <__adrian> exactly the opposite, in fact
[01:09:17] <stenno> end has a side effect
[01:09:29] <__adrian> yes, which is NOT that the pointer moves
[01:09:36] <__adrian> the pointer moving is the deliberate effect
[01:09:43] <__adrian> getting the value is the side effect
[01:09:54] <stenno> sure, ok
[01:10:05] <stenno> but you want to have the value, you don't want to 'move the pointer'
[01:10:07] <__adrian> as i said above, the pointer moving should generally not be a problem anyway
[01:10:26] <stenno> you people are way too chill about this stuff :v
[01:10:44] <velix> oh dear, what did I do :D
[01:11:18] <Blondie101010> velix:  you ask more questions than you write lines of code, that's why
[01:12:17] <Blondie101010> you'll never get better that way, even if you pay attention to all the feedback you get
[01:13:59] <stenno> Blondie101010: __adrian how about `list($last) = array_slice($array, -1);`
[01:14:25] <Blondie101010> why would it be any better?
[01:14:44] <Blondie101010> it will be slower for one thing
[01:14:47] <__adrian> that's a lot of work for no benefit
[01:15:06] <stenno> it does not mutate $array
[01:15:18] <__adrian> moving the pointer is not a mutation
[01:15:20] <Blondie101010> moving a cursor does not mutate it
[01:15:32] <__adrian> don't write code the relies on assuming the pointer position

[01:16:54] <stenno> in which situations does the cursor actually matter..?
[01:17:06] <Blondie101010> when you rely on it after
[01:17:06] <stenno> i assume stuff like next() which you shouldn't use anyway

[01:17:13] <stenno> ok i can see where you are coming from
[01:17:48] <Blondie101010> hmmm... don't like that "iterating an array the wrong way" :S
[01:17:59] <stenno> i would use the array_ for array manipulation or foreach/as for iteration
[01:18:04] <stenno> array_* methods
[01:18:16] <stenno> or array handling or w/e the right expression is
[01:18:58] <Blondie101010> but that wasn't adrian's point
[01:19:52] <stenno> how _do_ i iterate over an array in the wrong way, a while loop with next() ? :D
[01:19:59] <__adrian> sure
[01:19:59] <Blondie101010> something like that
[01:20:05] <stenno> oof
[01:20:05] <__adrian> or for()
[01:20:23] <Blondie101010> sometimes it can be useful
[01:20:27] <stenno> is that 3-clause for?
[01:20:36] <Blondie101010> doesn't matter

[02:55:34] <jaggz> what options are good, nowadays, for putting out a site with carousel type thumbnails, in rows,
[02:55:42] <jaggz> like a netflix type view or something
[02:56:41] <deltab> CSS grid
[02:56:42] <jaggz> will need to load the data from a sql db
[02:58:51] <jaggz> deltab, that just the low-level css thing?  I'm looking for a high level coding solution which lets the [customizable] carousels work, with some ajax retrieval of newly-appearing items
[02:59:03] <jaggz> both the items (columns) and rows
[03:01:00] <jaggz> I guess I don't mind spitting out the <divs> and stuff myself
[03:01:47] <deltab> oh right
[03:03:02] <jaggz> Maybe I do need to do the client and server side stuff separately.. looking at https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/demos.html now
[03:03:14] <deltab> if it's just single rows, I think all you need to do is make sure the elements are positioned horizontally, and make the container scrollable
[03:03:32] <jaggz> https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/lazyLoad.html
[03:03:44] <deltab> I see that pattern a lot in web pages on my phone, even without JS
[03:04:03] <jaggz> I wonder how they would do lazy loading without js
[03:04:13] <jaggz> (is there another term for this, other than lazy loading?)
[03:04:14] <deltab> there's an html attribute for it
[03:04:23] <deltab> loading="lazy" iirc
[03:04:46] <jaggz> neat
[03:04:48] <jaggz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading
[03:17:51] <jaggz> okay, so is there any layout toolkit, with js, that gives you a bunch of handy knickknacks, like little animations already set up, and you just enable them, pretty styles, etc.?
[03:18:10] <jaggz> if I just look for "templates" .. eh..
[03:18:26] <jaggz> (in my experience I've not had that great of experience with various templates anyway, even for-pay ones)
[03:19:52] <jaggz> (and "templates" itself doesn't encompass the slightly lower-level aim here, where I can pick and choose from stuff)
[03:23:14] <jaggz> I'm going to need to adapt this to mobile too, so I'm going to need to do some restapi type thing I guess

[10:12:57] <hans_> well for the time being it's practically impossible to write code that actually enters the !==CURLMSG_DONE condition, because that's the only message type that exists in upstream libcurl, for now. but that's subject to change, and when it does, guzzle will start closing curl handles prematurely, which is what that PR fixes
[10:13:19] <AllenJB> And give OSS maintainers time. They've almost certainly be notified of the additional comment on the PR. The PR has been open since May. Another few days is not going to cause any issues.

[15:16:26] <dag> when requiring a php file from a class method it's possible to access $this e.g. <?= $this->foo() ?> but <?= parent::foo() ?> gives error PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Cannot access parent:: when current class scope has no parent
[15:18:02] <dag> my class does actually inherit from a parent but looks like the parent:: keyword is not valid when it's not syntactically inside a class
[15:22:09] <Naktibalda> looks like a bad idea anyway
[15:22:35] <Naktibalda> better way to modify functionality is to use inheritance.

[15:35:02] <__adrian> dag: that's... smelly. write your code so you can simply use $this. this sounds like a template-rendering method or similar...? why would you need to use the parent class's version of the method? the template should be thought of as outside code, it shouldn't know anything about the inner workings of the class.
[15:38:34] <dag> yeah template rendering method. i want to call parent method because it emits some common html and each child may possibly add some additional html

[15:42:59] <__adrian> your template would do  echo $this->x();
[15:44:01] <__adrian> if you sometimes want parent and sometimes want child, then your class is broken: it should have two different methods with two different names.

[16:02:15] <goddard> how should i solve the error?
[16:02:53] <TinoDidriksen> If you build PHP from source, you need to build everything that depends on PHP from source as well, against your custom PHP.
[16:02:54] <AllenJB> goddard: What is the error message (and what was the command that caused it)?
[16:03:10] <goddard> Fatal error: Uncaught ErrorException: Composer detected issues in your platform: Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 8.0.0". You are running 7.4.24. in
[16:03:49] <TinoDidriksen> You should also use Docker or similar to isolate versions. You almost certainly don't need to build from source - there are packages of the versions you want.
[16:04:39] <__adrian> "dag> problem solved ... encapsulate the logic inside child method"  awesome
[16:05:24] <__adrian> goddard: that error seems pretty clear...? and yes, +1 for "don't build from source; there's almost never a good reason for this"
[16:05:26] <AllenJB> goddard: As I read that: Your project has a dependency (library) that requires PHP 8, but you're not running PHP 8. You need to either run the project on PHP 8 or modify the dependency minimum version (if your project code can use a lower version of the dependency)

[16:23:25] <goddard> 8 is installed on impish by default
[16:23:40] <__adrian> why do you need 7.4 in order to switch from short tags?

[16:24:13] <__adrian> what's that got to do with _fixing_ them?

[20:34:38] <__adrian> strictly, no. it _is_ something i would question, though.
[20:34:51] <Byteflux> It's wrong in the sense that __adrian mentioned, why are you putting stuff in the DOCUMENT_ROOT

And i then
[21:54:47] <rveerman> restarted the apache2 server, but i keep getting business logic PHP failures due failure to load&/find a specific function from that mailparse.so
[21:55:01] <rveerman> any clues would be much appreciated
[21:56:45] <da_wunder> rveerman: just to remind that php 8.0.0 is not the latest version 8.0.11 is the latest stable
[21:56:56] <rveerman> eh, i'm actually running 8.0.11 on a kubuntu overlay of ubuntu-20.04
[21:57:07] <rveerman> sry, hasty typo there

[21:59:59] <da_wunder> did you open that phpinfo() file with your browser or did you just executed that on cli?
[22:00:16] <da_wunder> just because cli and webserver could use different php.ini files

[22:56:04] <omegatron> ah, whatever ..
[22:56:28] <rveerman> update : i again recompiled mailparse.so, sticking to the exact instructions that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35793216/installing-mailparse-php7-mbstring-error/36636332#36636332 gives this time, then moved the compiled mailparse.so to the folder listed in /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini as the value for key extension_dir, and double-checked the file-modified date; it is now 8 minutes old..
[22:56:30] <da_wunder> omegatron: php 4 didn't really have classes
[22:56:51] <rveerman> then i retried my own business logic from the browser, and the function it needs is still not available
[22:57:10] <omegatron> ok, then why there are several reports  https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.9  about class-related stuff, huh?
[22:57:46] <omegatron> for example   https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22004
[22:57:59] <rveerman> and nothing in listed in the php error log either, and i've checked that it's set up properly : as value of the key error_log, but with a full path to the file you want it to write to
[22:58:12] <da_wunder> omegatron: In PHP 4 everything, including objects, was passed by value. That was changed in PHP5
[22:58:17] <Albright_> Pretty sure 4 had stdClass and inheritance but still didn't have the full breadth of OOP stuff that 5 introduced
[22:58:43] <omegatron> where did I mention anything about pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
[22:59:17] <da_wunder> that is something that classes most likely do...
[23:00:42] <da_wunder> "One of the main differences of OOP in PHP4 is that everything is open; no restrictions about the usage of methods or properties.

[23:46:58] <__adrian> there's nothing _really_ different about them beyond convenience
[23:47:06] <da_wunder> you really cannot compare that to js solution...
[23:47:10] <da_wunder> different languages...
[23:47:11] <__adrian> nope
[23:47:35] <stenno> __adrian: fat arrow has lexical scoping
[23:47:39] <__adrian> js is pretty substantially noncomparable to php
[23:47:46] <__adrian> stenno: no, it doesn't
[23:48:01] <__adrian> it's just a shorthand for  use (all,vars, currently, in, scope)
[23:48:10] <stenno> :|
[23:48:15] <__adrian> i.e., it copies them
[23:48:23] <__adrian> it does not share scope. nothing in php does that.
[23:49:33] <stenno> <hercules> disappointed!
[23:50:19] <novns> we need the scopeless PHP where all them scopes are gone
[23:50:30] <__adrian> lol
[23:51:14] <__adrian> bbl
[23:54:34] <Sammitch> we don't take kindly to yer datatypes round these parts.
[23:55:06] <stenno> that happens sometimes in php where something looks really and then it turns out to just be hack upon an existing feature
[23:55:15] <stenno> well thats not fair
[23:55:21] <stenno> but i am still disappointed
[23:55:30] <stenno> really neat*
