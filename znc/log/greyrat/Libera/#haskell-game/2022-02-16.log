[21:41:50] <EvanR> f-a how's the game jam going
[21:43:41] <f-a> EvanR: the game jam is over, I released a crappy, unfinished haskell game that taught me a lot tho, so I chalk it as a win
[21:44:02] <EvanR> how many days was it
[21:44:16] <EvanR> how long have I been asleep
[21:44:36] <f-a> 14 days
[21:45:32] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/pictonaut.zip ‚Üê this is *very very very* unfinished but I like the idea of making a roguelike adventure (I repeat, not even alpha, just a doodle)
[21:45:45] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/lj202202/log.txt and the logs
[21:46:04] <f-a> weekend was spent fixing a fridge, so that was a wrench in the wheels
[21:46:26] <f-a> one thing where I failed it taming QuickCheck to generate random but winnable scenarios
[21:46:31] <f-a> (I repeat, crap game ahead!)
[21:46:43] <f-a> I also learned a lot about how blind people interact with a terminal
[21:47:35] <EvanR> yeah just caught up on the log
[21:48:37] <f-a> not satisfied with my setup, I need to abstract some machinery in a library
[21:48:42] <EvanR> the experience of writing code but not enjoying it -- so real you can taste it xD
[21:49:36] <f-a> there are people who are better than me and could have approached this better
[21:50:10] <f-a> but again, it was a reality check and next few weeks I am going to standardise this ‚Äúmessages between sections of the game‚Äù I keep using
[21:51:25] <EvanR> the large scale glue
[21:51:37] <EvanR> I'm convinced no one does this right in any language xD
[21:51:46] <EvanR> and maybe computers are just bad at ait
[21:52:58] <ManofLetters[m]> right, we just need faster computer
[21:52:59] <ManofLetters[m]> s
[21:53:31] <EvanR> the computer context maybe, rather than the machine
[21:56:29] <f-a> but yeah, one of the things I want to try in 2022 is to become more efficient in what I do (coding related)
[21:57:07] <sm> good work f-a üëçüèª ‚úÖ
[21:58:03] <f-a> not where I wanted to land, but a delivery is a delivery and as I have said, ideas were learned
[21:58:17] <f-a> I also learned `ed` meanwhile :P
[21:58:35] <ManofLetters[m]> that explains a lot
[22:03:01] <sm> speaking of efficiency... today I am working on getting my emotions right for client work to go faster . 
[22:03:01] <sm> I noticed I start with the physical (todo item, hands on keyboard, hours clocked), resist resist, eventually get the mental on board (mind into the problem space), and only at last get emotions moving in the right direction (sense of achievement, desire). 
[22:03:57] <sm> I'm suspecting this is the wrong order
[22:04:24] <f-a> I would love to read a writeup about that
[22:04:53] <ManofLetters[m]> wow, my next step after "resist, resist" is usually quite different ;)
[22:05:10] <sm> f-a noted , thanks
[22:05:17] <EvanR> smoke break?
[22:06:12] <ManofLetters[m]> day off
[22:06:36] <EvanR> taking a mental day
[22:06:47] <f-a> I feel sm‚Äôs problem is slightly different
[22:06:50] <EvanR> for when the previous day was absolutely mental
[22:06:53] <f-a> what to do first to get in the mood
[22:06:53] <sm> Man of Letters: I did say "eventually" üôÇ
[22:07:24] <sm> in bad cases it can take weeks ‚òπÔ∏è
[22:08:24] <sm> probably a proper day off is what' aim not doing
[22:09:28] <ManofLetters[m]> is it similar to the famed "writer's block"?
[22:09:44] <ManofLetters[m]> I think writers break it the same way as you do
[22:09:50] <ManofLetters[m]> every day 5000, no excuse
[22:09:53] <ManofLetters[m]> *words
[22:10:03] <sm> yeah
[22:10:24] <f-a> I have read that and it is pretty scary
[22:10:28] <sm> quite similar I suspect
[22:10:51] <ManofLetters[m]> 500 lines of code; whatever code
[22:11:09] <ManofLetters[m]> to write good code, you need to write a lot of code
[22:11:15] <EvanR> ü§î
[22:11:41] <ManofLetters[m]> haha, I don't think it translates so straightforwardly
[22:11:54] <ManofLetters[m]> 500 lines of bad PHP a day
[22:12:04] <EvanR> 500 lines of perl poetry
[22:12:47] <ManofLetters[m]> 500 lines of code or of refactored code
[22:12:57] <sm> my client work is usually php but most often it's debugging/trying to understand problem reports / the system - no lines of code at all, no sense of flow, it's like facing a cliff
[22:13:14] <ManofLetters[m]> ouch
[22:13:26] <EvanR> that was where my last big corporate job ended up
[22:13:49] <ManofLetters[m]> writers have it easy
[22:13:50] <EvanR> web programming was so "solved" (not!) we never really wrote any code
[22:14:09] <EvanR> mainly fucking with ancillary things or massaging shit other people wrote
[22:14:24] <sm> have to find ways to increase sense of flow in such cases. usually writing/documenting helps but I tend not to allow that since it feels wasteful. but I might as well...
[22:14:46] <EvanR> I wrote a lot of documents
[22:14:55] <EvanR> not sure if anyone read them
[22:15:22] <EvanR> probably not, instead just starting from scratch
[22:15:56] <EvanR> but I guess it did solidify things in my head
[22:16:35] <sm> yes i write it for myself, to understand. but such docs will sure help my successor (if this thing outlasts me)
[22:16:48] <f-a> document writing is always good
[22:17:00] <f-a> worst case scenario ideas are crystal clear in your head
[22:17:02] <sm> big danger of getting sidetracked by documentation technology though
[22:17:09] <f-a> and most likely you are helping someone down the road
[22:17:26] <EvanR> at work it was google docs
[22:17:30] <sm> but, lately obsidian is my writing omni-tool and that's helping
[22:17:37] <EvanR> here it's endless vim text files
[22:20:45] <EvanR> in f-a's log there is a thing about boring code (that is necessary to get the game to even run) meanwhile the game logic is a long way off. Is it equally hard or more hard to write abstract game logic with no way to see anything? 
[22:21:31] <EvanR> is this the main difficulty with a 1 man operation
[22:24:49] <EvanR> i should get back to boring code
