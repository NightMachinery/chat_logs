[01:05:13] <Robomot> This Nintendo “insider” fooled thousands of followers with fake predictions | Ars Technica (Authentically timestamped Twitter forecasts that were literally too good to be true.)
[01:05:45] <gwern> quanticle: wouldn't help! you could just do the same trick at the account level. the problem is the privateing
[01:06:27] <gwern> quanticle: that is, even if twitter or someone made deletion impossible, you could just set up thousands of accounts set to private, register sets of predictions, and unprivate the winners
[01:06:55] <gwern> the problem here is that it *looks* like the predictions were made publicly, but they were not in fact made publicly but in private
[01:07:56] <gwern> "wow, these are amazing predictions in this public account. sure, I guess there could be thousands of accounts and I'm only looking at the lucky one, I know about the classic forecasting scam - but if there were all the failed sockpuppets, I would have noticed all those public predictions being tweeted! and I didn't."
[01:09:01] <quanticle> Right, but the fact that the correct predictions were made by different accounts would mitigate the problem. All of a sudden it's not *one* timeline filled with correct predictions about the next Nintendo announcement. It's a dozen timelines. And then you have to convince people that all those timelines are yours, and that you haven't made any others (set to private) which contain incorrect
[01:09:03] <quanticle> predictions.
[01:09:21] <gwern> no, you'd have a single account or two
[01:09:41] <quanticle> But then you'd have a bunch of private predictions

[01:12:00] <gwern> just come up with a bunch of roughly even predictions, come up with a dozen predictions each 50-50, generate each permutation per private account, and after a thousand or two private accounts, one of them should get all dozen right; you unprivate just that one

[02:08:57] <ggreer> if substack added video embeds it'd probably be the best of both worlds. often I want a short video showing something along with text that I can skim

[02:09:43] <mst> this is true but also intensely annoying.
[02:09:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's kind of amazing that Substack doesn't support that
[02:10:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's so easy to support
[02:10:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (OborWiki supports video embeds, of course)
[02:10:20] <ggreer> I wonder if you could cobble some ML stuff together to figure out which parts of a video are just talking (not showing), then transcribe & summarize those bits, then intersperse that text with embedded clips of the showing

[02:11:03] <ggreer> it's certainly possible with today's tech but you'd have to train the stuff yourself. no way that openai would let you do something that open-ended
[02:11:14] <kuudes> ggreer, I expect over here the ev electric spike will get priced in

[02:11:41] <ggreer> kuudes: here most meters aren't smart. a guy just walks up and reads them once a month
[02:11:47] <quanticle> Yeah
[02:11:50] <mst> and he mentions a subscriber only video
[02:12:00] <mst> though as a non-subscriber I can't find out how that worked
[02:12:07] <kuudes> yeah. it required a law which makes smart meters mandatory and that they log your usage for 6 years per hour...
[02:12:08] <PlanckWalk> At the moment here they're not even reading them.  They estimate them every three months.
[02:12:09] <ggreer> mst: oh. huh. I guess more substackers should take advantage of that
[02:12:30] <kuudes> but yeah, it allows in near future sort of negative electricity production
[02:12:36] <kuudes> ie timing of movable consumption
[02:12:51] <mst> '6 years per hour'
[02:12:52] <mst> what
[02:13:13] <kuudes> the log is for 6 years. every hour gets counted each
[02:13:25] <kuudes> personally I dislike the privacy loss
[02:13:25] <ggreer> ah
[02:13:51] <kuudes> it feels a bit odd they wanted to tie the usage to person, not usage location
[02:14:42] <ggreer> with electricity and internet becoming less dependent on the grid, I wonder if I should buy some land in the middle of nowhere. food & water would be the only real issues. water is solved with rainwater and/or a well. food is solved with a costco membership
[02:15:07] <ggreer> even if I don't build something on it for a decade, it's not like the land will become worthless. and the low price will mean low property taxes
[02:15:28] <kuudes> might want to look into how climate change will develop the location?
[02:15:44] <kuudes> 13 C is apparently the human optimum
[02:16:12] <kuudes> which would suggest prices would be highest at location which has that
[02:17:21] <mst> which would also suggest that prices of land that's colder than that -now- but won't be -later- might be lower, which might make it worth a thought investment wise
[02:18:06] <ggreer> I'm much more worried about future danger from stupid laws (eg way more taxes and/or surveillance) and natural disasters (floods, fires, tornadoes) than a 4C difference in max temperature
[02:19:39] <gwern> you're probably in more danger from disability, from things like RSI or TBI, especially when any running or motorcycles get mixed in
[02:19:46] <kuudes> mst, indeed
[02:20:37] <kuudes> in europe the line of optimum seems to be moving maybe from uk-germany-slovenia to denmark-poland-bulgaria
[02:21:01] <kuudes> not much, but some hundreds of kilometers
[02:21:19] <mst> my bit of england still manages to get below freezing every winter so I'm reasonably happy
[02:21:24] <kuudes> it is indeed eye opening to look at europe's population density maps on square kilometer level

[04:27:21] <galambo> hi I just had a shower thought. why do we care about politics? I mean politics kind of shapes how the country we live in works. but we cannot really affect it. the country we live in is a package. the package includes the laws/rights, the wages we get, healthcare etc. we can either accept the package the way it is. or if we dont like it we can leave the country and go somewhere else with better wages/healthcare/laws. its like buying a phone. I dont care 
[04:27:21] <galambo> about the design choice or the internal politics in the company. I just care about the final product. if theres a better phone out there I can just sell mine and buy a new one.
[04:28:42] <Betawolf> politics is about how those packages might be changing in the future
[04:29:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: Congratulations on reinventing neocameralism
[04:29:34] <quanticle> galambo: Pure entertainment. I care about politics for the same reason I watch football or Formula 1
[04:29:36] <PlanckWalk> You'd probably care more about the phone if it cost on the order of $100k to get a new one, you had to change jobs and language, and you had to get highly length and bureacratic permission (possibly taking years) of the other phone's manufacturer to buy the new one.
[04:29:49] <kuudes> I live here and don't want to leave

[04:30:45] <PlanckWalk> Costs of switching political systems is *insane* anywhere except maybe Europe.
[04:30:57] <PlanckWalk> And even there pretty darn high.
[04:31:07] <adiabatic> I dunno, moving out of California is pretty popular
[04:31:36] <PlanckWalk> How many percent per month?
[04:32:03] <adiabatic> beats me. I think we're at net negative population growth
[04:32:13] <galambo> PlanckWalk, but caring about politics will not really change the outcome, so whats the point? wouldnt you be better off just expending your resources into moving to a new country instead of worrying? this optionality is actually liberating in a sense.
[04:32:26] <adiabatic> which is pretty freaky since we're still right adjacent to, and way better than, Mexico
[04:32:56] <Betawolf> if you pay no attention to politics then you won't know where to flee to
[04:34:13] <galambo> Betawolf, I would have thought the countries worth living in dont show up much on the news?
[04:34:57] <kuudes> new zealand has been on news for being too good lately though
[04:35:39] <PlanckWalk> New Zealand is one of my practically achievable options, being in Australia
[04:37:33] <kuudes> if you move to iceland it seems pretty feasible to affect the politics there

[04:38:11] <kuudes> I don't know
[04:38:12] <adiabatic> you? easy. me? hard
[04:38:22] <Betawolf> if you pay attention to local politics you could actually affect things where you live

[04:41:03] <saturn2> we cannot affect the laws of physics but it's still useful to know about them
[04:41:14] <PlanckWalk> At which point is politics "too large" for a person to affect?
[04:41:18] <kuudes> re covid times it seems I may have changed interpretation of rules some 4 times, but I am not sure, there is not clear causal but only temporal connection
[04:41:53] <PlanckWalk> Or, at which point woudl removing yourself from the process make no difference?

[04:47:20] <PlanckWalk> So I don't really accept that caring about politics will not really change the outcome.
[04:48:09] <PlanckWalk> It might not have a direct and easily verifiable effect on the largest scales, but it has some on smaller scales and may affect larger scales to a lesser extent.
[04:48:19] <kuudes> I think in usa it likely is much harder
[04:48:30] <kuudes> because they have lower number of representatives
[04:48:40] <kuudes> so there are fewer people who you can connect to
[04:48:44] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and in any event >300M people is a lot.
[04:48:54] <kuudes> well sure
[04:49:04] <kuudes> but my sister has been in mep's staff, so...

[04:55:14] <gwern> let's see... first 10% finished. irritatingly, it stored the database in sorted order, so can't just diff it... it is in fact somewhat longer as intended. 'fgrep --count '<p>' custom-small.yaml custom-small.yaml-updated / custom-small.yaml:1274 / custom-small.yaml-updated:1471' <-- well, that looks as intended. a lot more paragraphs
[04:58:00] <gwern> ah, I can simply read & write the original to put it in order too, excellent, that gives me a usable diff
[04:58:22] <adiabatic> like a YAML auto-sorter?
[04:58:26] <Otthorn[m]> 450M in EU? Seems very low. I think its more around 700M

[05:20:44] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: that's the facebook override for locally hosted PDFs, especially the ones in docs/www/
[05:20:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: PDF links, with a hash that does not *start with* but only *contains, somewhere after the starts*, the string "facebook"?
[05:20:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like what does that actually look like
[05:21:18] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: '/docs/www/arxiv.org/623e4587b41c5a9a173d25659074c597706f444a.pdf#facebook'

[05:21:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm yes it will
[05:21:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[05:21:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It will also match this:
[05:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> a[href*="#facebook"]
[05:21:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> So why the fancy one?
[05:22:21] <gwern> I *think* it is because I was unsure how to handle 'page=N' links combination with the org. '#page=5&org=facebook'?
[05:22:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah!
[05:22:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait
[05:23:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that a GET-parameter-formatted string ... as a URL hash instead of actual GET parameters?
[05:23:12] <gwern> do you have to put the page=N first? can it be '#facebook&page=5'? such uncertainties vex me
[05:23:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf
[05:23:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the "&org=facebook" even *doing* there
[05:23:36] <gwern> well, the page= is read by the PDF reader. the 'org=' is ignored and is there as documentation
[05:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see
[05:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> sigh
[05:24:03] <gwern> does '#page=5&facebook' work??? these are things I didn't care to try. org= worked when I tried, so I stuck with it
[05:24:16] * gwern is pretty sure '#page=5facebook' would not work
[05:25:24] <gwern> (inband metadata is pretty sweet and convenient when it works, but there's always the nagging question of whether you have gone too far and it really needs to be out-of-band)
[05:28:25] <mst> from the point of view of the webserver, # -is- out of band
[05:28:46] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I also experimented with puttin the query parameter on the PDF URL (which presumably ignores it also) and then the hash: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-1645322279416502.png

[05:29:45] <gwern> but there's not too many atm so I can easily do site-wide string-replacements if you need a particular set updated

[06:23:12] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: got it training on a v3-64 :)
[06:24:00] <PapuaHardyNet> only downside: had to disable spectral norms logging, activation distribution summary logging, and wandb - first two didn't work on multi-TPU devices, and wandb reliably crashed JAX on a TPU
[06:24:11] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: only issue I can see is that old issue about the File: Wikipedia popup
[06:24:34] <PapuaHardyNet> basically my code is suckless because if it wasn't, it wouldn't work lmao
[06:24:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not linkicons
[06:24:56] <gwern> it is not but thought I'd mention it while I was at it
[06:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> No other problems you can see then?

[06:27:08] <gwern> EPUB looks good
[06:27:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool cool
[06:27:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't pull yet, gotta build one last part of this system
[06:33:00] * gwern is still running paragraphizer anyway
[06:42:15] <PapuaHardyNet> so I decided: wandb causes dependency conflicts with numba, and apart from that still crashes the TPU even after disregarding the dependency conflict, so I should use guildAI for visualizing logging. I used it in a previous project, and it was nice. Things will be fine, right?
[06:43:13] <PapuaHardyNet> wrong! I dropped guildAI a few months ago *because* of it having a dependency conflict. I just tried it, and boom, it vendors a library that has an issue. Upgrading the library via pip does nothing since the library with the bug is vendored. amazing!
[06:43:38] <gwern> ah python
[06:47:31] <mst> right, you pull it down, replace the vendored library with a fixed version, build and install that
[06:47:35] <mst> should be basically trivial
[06:47:39] <mst> or at least it is in perl
[06:49:43] <gwern> regrettably, only boomers and Xers these days know how awesome cpan is and how perl solved packaging problems 2 decades ago that other languages have yet to pull their thumbs out of their butts long enough to realize they have
[06:50:04] <gwern> 'computing is a pop culture' etc
[06:50:25] <mst> you are not wrong, sadly
[06:50:56] <mst> also perl's equivalent of virtualenv is a script that sets five environment variables and then all installation within that shell just works
[06:51:20] * gwern has never been much impressed by perl the language or VM, but CPAN and that ecosystem is an entirely different story
[06:52:13] <mst> this is entirely fair, and I suspect I know perl well enough to hate the language and the VM more extensively than most of the people who think they're good at complaing about them
[06:52:35] <mst> what keeps me writing perl is the attitude and the ecosystem
[06:53:37] <mst> gwern: oh, heh, you remember the leftpad debacle on npm was because they got legal threats from somebody about a namespace?
[06:54:17] <gwern> I remember the leftpad itself but not the roots
[06:55:43] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: But doing that at scale, on multiple machines? I assume your answer would be to fork guildai, fix its vendoring, and then use the forked version instead. which is sensible, but feels like yak shaving imo
[06:55:50] <mst> right, so, the root was that a company got pissy at npm because $author had uploaded a package that was a client to their API named after their company
[06:56:04] <mst> and npm gave them the namespace unilaterally
[06:56:12] <mst> so $author got pissed and unpublished all his modules
[06:56:15] <mst> which included leftpad
[06:56:22] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I'm making a github account to create and issue and lol, github doesn't allow >72 char passwords. what do they do, store it in rot13?
[06:56:53] <mst> cpan got sent a similar threat a year or so later - by Nagios, natch, because they're cunts
[06:57:41] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: what do you need a >72 char password for? that's a public key at that point, especially if they salt and use a slow hash like I assume. and github supports actual public keys
[06:57:59] <gwern> mst: and told them to go pound sand, one assumes
[06:58:08] <mst> gwern: p3rl.org/Nagios::Plugin
[06:58:11] <Robomot> Nagios::Plugin - Removed from CPAN by request of Nagios Enterprises, succeeded by Monitoring::Plugin - metacpan.org (Removed from CPAN by request of Nagios Enterprises, succeeded by Monitoring::Plugin)
[06:58:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I just use a password generator that defualts to 90 chars
[06:58:56] <gwern> mst: hm. goatse would've been better
[06:59:26] <mst> gwern: read the entire thing and consider just how much this enraged them
[06:59:28] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: at that point you're asking for subtle problems with truncated inputs or mistyped initial passwords and whatnot and risk locking yourself out
[07:00:02] <gwern> mst: you could've written an explanation *and* used goatse, I'd note
[07:00:53] <mst> gwern: this is true, but the very polite 'fuck you' was optimal for my purposes at the time
[07:00:56] <PapuaHardyNet> whoa, you are right about the truncated inputs. I'll lower it to 50 chars
[07:01:11] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:01:25] <mst> gwern: I'd also note that during those conversations they'd said "hey, you should talk to the fedora guys, they see it our way"
[07:02:21] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: not a hypothetical btw I have seen people online report issues with truncation lengths. I think the particularly vicious form is when the original input form allows a longer password than other / later inputs, and so you *can't* enter the same password
[07:02:31] <mst> gwern: it turns out they'd lied massively to the fedora guys, and my talking to them resulted in fedora going "wait, what? fuck these arseholes" and canceling the process of giving them control of the fedora package
[07:03:18] <mst> that's not in my public notes because I saw no advantage to giving the nagios ent. cunts an excuse to cause trouble for people who were doing the right thing
[07:04:23] <mst> gwern: what's really funny is I missed the original threat ... but then a couple days after I got a /msg from another cpan admin saying "hey, there's a situation here, and I think it's one you might enjoy dealing with" ... he wasn't wrong :D
[07:05:04] <gwern> they knew mst once shot a man in reno with a vaccine to watch him not die
[07:06:47] <mst> nagios really did not know what was about to hit them, and it was fucking funny
[07:08:27] <mst> note that shadowcat has a big chunk of legal insurance for various purposes, most of which are sensible commercial stuff, but some of which are because our managing director knows me well enough that it seemed like a wise idea
[07:08:54] <gwern> 'Hi there, You've reached your API usage soft limit of $96.00 for this month, which has triggered this friendly notification email. Don't worry, you still have API access! Your current hard limit is set to $120.00. If you reach this amount we'll start rejecting your API requests.' <-- hm, well, not surprised
[07:09:32] <mst> gwern: though honestly the fact it was me isn't the real point, the real point is that cpan's response was to find the biggest gun we had and aim it at the arseholes heads
[07:10:00] <gwern> yes, laudable in comparison (although it still should've been ascii goatse or something imo, I accept that it is no longer the '90s)
[07:10:07] <mst> I was honoured to be that gun, but it's the overall attitude that's the thing that's pretty cool about cpan

[07:12:06] <mst> > Mike informs me that "Simply copying legal on an email should not be construed as a threat of legal action", and that instead the mention of legal was because "We find it easier to get them involved from the start as they tend to understand the gravity of the situation a little quicker than most folks."

[07:12:12] <mst> I'm a programmer, not a lawyer, and as such am not qualified to have an opinion thereupon.

[07:15:38] <gwern> yes

[07:16:59] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: also, btw, your 'at scale' thing ... fixing up a pinned version and inserting it so that gets installed instead of the upstream version is trivial in perl land, and if python can't do that yet please grab the nearest relevant python maintainer and get them to talk to me so I can help them steal the relevant infrastructure :D

[07:27:29] <gwern> I'm a little puzzled how you can make 700 long videos and not have copies. a video can be a lot of work! did she upload each one and then go into a spring cleaning frenzy
[07:28:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, honestly, yeah, they kinda have a point?
[07:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did she have her videos ONLY on YouTube? Nowhere else?
[07:28:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not locally at all?
[07:28:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> That... yeah, that's extremely dumb, actually
[07:29:11] <adiabatic> "a bunch of NASes" makes it sounds like there were lots and lots of video data
[07:29:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok... I mean, this woman created the videos at great effort and expense, but... she was paying YouTube how much? To store them and to guarantee data persistence etc.?

[07:30:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I will spend lots of money to make a thing but $0 on ensuring that the thing doesn't go up in flames instantly and unrecoverably" doesn't seem like a smart stance
[07:31:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> What was her plan for if YouTube decided to delete them or ban her or... anything?
[07:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did she have a plan?
[07:31:25] <PlanckWalk> "Plan? What is this?"
[07:31:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is this another one of those "Americans do not make plans or think even one step ahead, ever" situations?
[07:32:03] <PapuaHardyNet> have you never felt the rush of waking up and wondering whether your life's work has been destroyed because of the whims of an overzealous corporate AI?
[07:32:20] <PlanckWalk> Well yes, but not on Youtube.
[07:32:27] <PapuaHardyNet> (i have no mouth and i must scream)
[07:32:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow I'm reading this post and it's even worse than I assumed
[07:32:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. This was for her company that she started, so that's like triple the reason to back up
[07:32:58] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: I still love perl but I'm not trying to convince anybody else to love it, I just get annoyed when other open source things haven't stolen our good shit already, like, what is open source for if not that? :D
[07:33:01] <PlanckWalk> PapuaHardyNet: Isn't that just the default state of anyone who has heard the term "AI alignment"?
[07:33:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Youtube actually sent her strikes first, and her response was somehow *not* "oh shit this is a wakeup call, I will now *immediately, fucking right goddamn now* back everything up"
[07:33:40] <nshepperd2> > You did the best you could with the information you were given. I don't think anyone should have to resort to building multiple NAS and distributing them geographically. It's 2022 and this an extremely esoteric thing to do.
[07:33:53] * Obormot\Arcturus facepalm
[07:33:57] <nshepperd2> literally just a pile of hard drives in the corner of the room would have been better than nothing
[07:34:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What about BUYING SOME HARD DRIVES
[07:34:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[07:34:35] <gwern> I realize 700 videos is a lot of videos but is it really 'can't even fit in standard consumer 8tb drives'
[07:34:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, for real though, how much was she paying youtube for this service? If the answer is "uh nothing" then WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU EXPECT
[07:35:34] <nshepperd2> 700 hour long videos will run you like... 1 TB
[07:35:42] <PlanckWalk> 700 videos isn't even 2 TB unless they're like a day long each
[07:36:03] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah it was nothing
[07:36:41] <quanticle> Yeah, the more I think about this, the dumber it seems. I have a habit of downloading videos with yt-dlp. I've downloaded pretty much every YouTube video I've watched over the past year. There are 3021 videos, many of them are 3+ hours long
[07:36:50] <quanticle> And the hard drive I have them on is 4TB
[07:36:56] <quanticle> And not even totally full yet
[07:37:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Forget "download", she *created* the videos, she had to *upload* them in the first place
[07:37:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> So she had the damn files
[07:37:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then
[07:37:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Deleted them?
[07:37:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because lol youtube is gonna store my shit for free forever?
[07:37:25] <quanticle> So this isn't even a matter of having a bunch of hard drives. Literally 1 hard drive. 1 hard drive that cost < $200
[07:37:30] <quanticle> Could have solved this problem
[07:37:32] <gwern> (boom, $120.21)
[07:38:18] <quanticle> gwern: What service is this, where you have a $120 hard cap?
[07:38:36] <gwern> the OA API. they can lift it, of course, they just haven't because I only requested it like 15 minutes ago
[07:38:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this guy is all like "oh yeah I should have had geographically distributed NASes but oh that would've been so onerous" ... like, yeah, keep telling yourself that your only option was "do thing that nobody can reasonably blame you for not doing", buddy
[07:39:04] <gwern> 'perfect is the enemy of better'. actually, sorta sounds like the stuff TLP would excoriate you for
[07:39:10] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, it's insane for a person who spends many thousands of hours on something to keep their own copy.
[07:39:18] <PlanckWalk> Who does that!?
[07:39:54] <gwern> "I should have had a geo NAS - bullshit. you didn't *want* to keep the videos. you were *hoping* youtube would delete them for you. so you are freed from your burden. 'Gosh', you say, 'it's out of my hands'. You'd make me sick except I see my own sickness in you.' &etc 
[07:40:17] <PlanckWalk> It's 2022, the socially approved method it to hand it all over to a corporate bureaucracy and delete all other copies.
[07:41:11] <gwern> 'I'm the victim you say. What a service! You ought to be paying Youtube to take the blame for you - but wait, here's a 15s roll ad. It's porn. It's all porn. Always has been.'
[07:41:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "FYI, before you chastise the OP for not backing up, please take a minute and think about the fact that this can happen with Gmail too. Have you backed up your email?" ... you're goddamn right I have
[07:41:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have that shit backed up in several places
[07:41:43] <quanticle> I don't even use GMail any more
[07:41:45] <quanticle> For that reason
[07:42:07] <PlanckWalk> Yep, backed up in multiple locations.
[07:42:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've been migrating away from it slowly ... perhaps too slowly, but the point is: yes I damn well do have it backed up
[07:42:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would you ever not!
[07:42:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> It supports IMAP!
[07:42:37] <PlanckWalk> And the amount of space it takes it pretty trivial

[08:07:05] <adiabatic> Looks fine to me.
[08:07:11] <gwern> ok, one is dark mode, but what's the what-if here
[08:07:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> The what if is just changing it to that
[08:07:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> From what it is now
[08:07:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is like https://share.obormot.net/screenshots/Arcturus_Screen%20Shot%202022-02-19%20at%2011.37.34%20PM.png

[08:07:57] <adiabatic> yeah, newer is way better
[08:09:00] <gwern> if you make the lines thicker it's going to blur together even more into a small opaque rectangle, especially in dark mode
[08:09:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I... made them thinner
[08:09:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the whole thing bigger
[08:10:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> The first screenshots I pasted are new (proposed), last one is current
[08:10:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Honestly it's so obviously an improvement that I'm just gonna commit it
[08:10:53] <gwern> oh, I got the direction reversed
[08:10:58] <gwern> yes, the new one is better
[08:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[08:11:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok pull
[08:11:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gonna do some more work on this tomorrow but yeah let's start testing it live
[08:12:25] <gwern> I'm starting a sync
[08:13:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Also, I'd like you to take a look at links.js and see if you can figure out how to add new linkicons, without me explaining anything about the new system... I wrote a bunch of comments but who knows if they make sense to anyone but me. I hope they do! I tried to make it easy to extend/modify
[08:14:25] <gwern> yeah, I'll look tomorrow as well
[08:14:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool
[08:15:18] <mst> tomorrow is rat trap day
[08:15:24] <mst> this should be fun
[08:15:50] <quanticle> Rat trap day?
[08:16:11] <quanticle> I know your British folks have some weird holidays (Boxing Day), but this is a new one
[08:16:19] <quanticle> *you British folks
[08:16:23] <mst> quanticle: https://www.mammal.org.uk/species-hub/full-species-hub/discover-mammals/species-black-rat/
[08:16:27] <Robomot> Species – Black rat – The Mammal Society (Black rat (Rattus rattus) / Taxon: Rodentia / Black Rat Red List Classification: / GB: N/A / England: N/A / Scotland: N/A / Wales: N/A / Global: Least Concern / General fact sheet (click to download) / Habitat: In UK mainly restricted to dockland warehouses, food processing plants, supermarkets, restaurants and other large buildings. Does not live out of doors in …)
[08:16:34] <gwern> quanticle: oh, is that what you trap in the boxes? makes sense
[08:16:44] <quanticle> Okay, but why do you have a special holiday to trap them?
[08:16:58] <quanticle> Is the problem that bad?
[08:17:01] <gwern> it's like parents always say, it's less of a chore if you make it a game?
[08:17:16] <mst> quanticle: it isn't, it's that I'll be grabbing the trap I ordered and bringing it into my apartment
[08:17:34] <gwern> or maybe it's one of those old community hunt strategies: everyone hunts on the same day, driving them into a panic and ensuring they get trapped
[08:18:06] <mst> then once I've trapped the little fucker I'll re-use a friend's fishtank as a home
[08:18:21] <gwern> he'll sleep with the fishes?
[08:19:02] <mst> it's been smart so far so rather than dropping it miles away I'm going to try and domesticate it
[08:19:29] <mst> relatively rare breed, and rats are smart, so it's worth a try
[08:20:25] <mst> gwern: the rat is not sharing my bed
[08:20:36] <gwern> what a cruel thing to say here
[08:21:00] <mst> *LOL*
[08:21:13] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:21:38] <mst> seriously though, if I'm right and it's a british black rat, they're actually pretty smart for rodents of usual size
[08:21:43] <quanticle> Okay, just don't get rabies.
[08:21:49] <mst> quanticle: england
[08:24:12] <mst> but if I make sure to put a few pistachios down on the floor he doesn't try and interfere with anything else, just comes in here to escape bad weather
[08:24:40] <quanticle> Oh. So he's a polite houseguest
[08:24:57] <quanticle> Or she, I suppose
[08:25:12] <quanticle> I don't know what sex your rat is
[08:25:19] <mst> which suggests to me he's smart enough to be domesticable so I figure I'll try
[08:25:30] <quanticle> And, knowing rats, well, he/she might change their mind on what gender they are too
[08:25:30] <mst> yeah, I'm using 'he' as a placeholder
[08:25:42] <mst> not like the rat's going to care if I get it wrong
[08:26:04] <quanticle> Oh, I find that some rats will correct you if you misgender them
[08:26:20] <mst> but yes, very much polite houseguest overall
[08:27:25] <mst> so I figure I might as well try and trap him and turn him into a pet
[08:27:42] <gwern> this is how group houses start
[08:29:01] <mst> gwern: eh, $fiancee is much more in favour of this than she has been of most of my other partners, it'll be fine
[08:29:20] <gwern> don't say you weren't warned
[08:30:17] <mst> this rat is smart and cute, we're both in agreement that it should be captured and domesticated
[08:31:16] <mst> I already know it likes bourbon biscuits and doner meat
[08:31:30] <mst> it is a rat of taste
[08:32:18] <quanticle> I wonder what a good diet would be, though, for a rat. Bourbon biscuits and doner meat, exclusively, doesn't sound like a good diet for either rats or humans.
[08:33:08] <quanticle> Also, on that web site that you linked, it states that the primary predator of the black rat is the domestic house cat.
[08:34:22] <mst> oh, sure, that's a diet that will let me catch it
[08:35:29] <mst> also why I need to catch it and teach it to live in domestic environs before my cat shows up here
[08:35:31] <nshepperd2> huh, the primary predator, really?
[08:35:56] <quanticle> Well, they live in urban areas, so I guess it makes sense.
[08:36:05] <nshepperd2> they don't get eaten by birds and things?
[08:36:20] <mst> nshepperd2: this is england, we already murdered the bigger predators because they were inconvenient
[08:37:05] <nshepperd2> lol
[08:37:33] <quanticle> Yeah, Wikipedia says that outside of urban areas, they're eaten by weasels, foxes and coyotes. But in England, I don't think there are too many of those around.
[08:38:00] <mst> quanticle: we still have foxes, don't know about weasels
[08:38:07] * gwern ponders all the London and EU jokes one could make there
[08:38:08] <mst> quanticle: coyotes totally aren't a thing here
[08:38:28] <gwern> didn't need coyotes before brexit
[08:38:32] <quanticle> lol
[08:38:33] <mst> quanticle: otherwise I'd want a dachshund to go with my cat
[08:39:25] <quanticle> Wait, you own a cat? Aren't you worried that your cat will eat your new houseguest? Or worse, treat it as a new toy to torture^W play with?

[08:51:28] <mst> he used to go hiking with the girl in the picture (who is $fiancee)
[08:51:42] <mst> when she'd stop for the night and make camp he'd wander off
[08:52:00] <mst> then come back a bit later dragging a rabbit that was bigger than he was

[08:55:02] <mst> quanticle: but yeah, back when she was on an oregon redneckville farm, she saw a coyote menacing him out the window ... by the time she got outside with her rifle it was already over, he'd broken both the coyote's front legs and wrapped his jaws around its throat so all she had to do was stand and be impressed until the coyote dropped dead of asphyxiation ;)

[17:41:11] <two2thehead> 'Okazaki and his colleagues used electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle responses as 20 woman completed various tasks that involved smiling or talking with or without a mask. The researchers were particularly interested in the orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus major, and depressor anguli oris — facial muscles that are involved in smiling and speaking
[17:41:12] <two2thehead> 'Wearing a mask was associated with increased orbicularis oculi activity when smiling. In other words, the researchers observed increased muscle activity around the eye when the participants smiled while wearing a mask compared to when they were not wearing a mask.'

[17:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ... the big win, at this point, now that the system's designed, the design validated, and the CSS infrastructure for it in place, would be to move the logic in links.js to the server side. This would be a huge win for client-side performance - not only over the current (new) system, but over the previous (wholly CSS-based) approach as well!

When actors first enter a community, the community rewards them for their easier-to-evaluate contributions to the community. Eventually, however, as these actors rise in status, further increases in stature come increasingly from engaging in actions that are more difficult to evaluate or even impossible to judge. These dynamics produce a positive 
[20:00:22] <two2thehead> feedback loop, in which those who have already been accorded some stature garner even greater status through quality-ambiguous actions. We present evidence from Stack Overflow, an online community, and from two online experiments consistent with these expected patterns.'

[21:50:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Once, to "hold a hackathon", or otherwise an event, meant that people come to a place, and do something together, physically in the same place...
[21:50:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Today - what does any of it mean? Images on a screen...

[21:53:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hmm, the youtu.be link works fine - I don't actually see the problem you described - but the youtube.com link doesn't even give a popup...!
[21:53:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah it's to a *channel*. ... why is it to a channel??
[21:53:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of your redirect rewrite things gone wrong?

[21:54:38] <gwern> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-FcS0EEnYY isn't a channel

[21:55:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Which link are we talking about, exactly
[21:56:10] <gwern> 'Other: video popups' in # Link Types
[21:56:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It works totally fine
[21:57:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> But take a look at the youtube.com link in link-icons
[21:57:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> That one's to a channel
[21:57:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> This video not playing or w/e, that seems to be on your end
[21:57:40] <gwern> that seems fine to me. channels exist
[21:57:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ok I guess they do
[21:57:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, unrelatedly
[21:58:07] <gwern> and the youtu.be link throws the same error and requiring two clicks to play
[21:58:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is it that on /index, in the Wikipedia section...
[21:58:22] <gwern> (this is a --temp-profile chromium so it shouldn't be any weird setting or extension or plugin)
[21:58:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the "WP & Whatever" links...
[21:58:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> The "WP & [first letter of whatever word" are wrapped in a smallcaps-auto span
[21:59:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> It looks weird AND it causes text shadow overlap, making it look even more weird
[21:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah that video works fine for me too. Let me test in Chromium I guess
[22:00:05] <gwern> I was trying to match whole phrases like "CSS & HTML" to make it look a little more consistent and reduce the number of spans
[22:00:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this case it does not seem visually appropriate, plus the glitch...
[22:01:10] <gwern> that one is due to "[A-Z]+ & [A-Z]+|"... hm. bet I can sharpen that
[22:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hmmm. I do see that issue in Chromium. I don't know what the console errors are about, but the double-start seems to be because you need to activate the html5 video element, and THEN, you have to start the youtube video player
[22:03:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whereas in FF the latter happens automatically, i.e. the youtube player autoplays once the video element loads it
[22:04:03] <gwern> (hm, no I can't, because there's no way to know what happens outside the Str which could be broken arbitrarily. oh well. I'll just delete that one. 'CSS & HTML' will just have to be two spans)
[22:04:27] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: unfortunate. so probably nothing we can help
[22:04:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I doubt there is, yeah

[22:18:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So ... the sample links for a .jsonl is https://www.gwern.net/docs/ai/anime/2020-06-08-danbooru2019-palm-handannotations-export.jsonl which is an ~8 MB file of over 118k lines. When displayed in a popup this results in the creation of ~118k DOM objects and the rendering of ~118k elements, plus an equal number of text nodes and pseudo-elements. The effects on the browser's responsiveness, etc., are about what you'd
[22:18:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  expect...
[22:19:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I am not sure what is the thing to do about such things... but something, surely; this is a very nasty surprise to spring on the reader!
[22:19:36] <gwern> it's there to test the link icon, not be a good idea to browse :)
[22:19:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, but my point is, do you guarantee you never link to any such thing on a real page?
[22:21:22] <gwern> no, because I do link one of the .jsonls on /Crops but it's clearly described as the full export and so the programmer reader has only themselves to blame
[22:21:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhh
[22:21:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't endorse that view
[22:22:01] <gwern> ' We used Shawn Presser's annotation website (`https://experiments-573d7.firebaseapp.com/exp?n=hands`) May--June 2020, and in total, we annotated _n_ = 14,394 hands in _k_ = 5,382 images ([JSON](/docs/ai/anime/2020-06-08-danbooru2019-palm-handannotations-export.jsonl)).' <-- any time you start using units like 'k' the reader knows they're not getting a few bon mots and a paragraph summary
[22:22:02] <Robomot> tagpls.com (Tag me, senpai!)
[22:22:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Surely it's not intuitive or natural to make the connection from "this is a link to some sort of big file I guess" to "if I mouse over this link then my browser will detonate and take out half my apartment block in the ensuing explosion"
[22:23:10] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, whenever I'm stuck on a pretty strange bug, gurkenglas' voice in my head tells me that I should be using a debugger
[22:23:18] <PapuaHardyNet> and I do use a debugger. And it helps a lot!
[22:23:32] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: maybe the raw-doc popups should truncate?
[22:24:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe, yeah
[22:24:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll think about how to do that best
[22:24:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was going to alter the implementation of code popups a bit anyway
[22:25:40] <mst> admittedly, if you've ever tried to debug modern front end javascript, you're likely to mostly be grateful that it only took out half the block

[23:36:23] <feepbot> <gwern> 'A trick I picked up years ago is not to save good policy from being weaponized but to plant instructions on how to destroy it for future wonks to use. Every policy or process doc I write now has a section called “Reasons to Revisit.” It is essentially a reverse success criteria. Rather than a short list of things I would expect to see if the policy was successful —
[23:36:24] <feepbot> which I do but in a different section — I write about things I would expect to see if the policy needed substantial revisions or to just be killed off altogether. It’s important that these signals be as specific as possible. If you’re familiar with the methodology of Objectives and Key Results, you should write them the same way you write Key Results. Be specific, be
[23:36:24] <feepbot> measurable and double check that whatever correlations you’re assuming are relevant. Some policy people think they’re covered by writing a summary of their goals and intentions in the beginning of the document. That should make it clear to everyone what interpretations make sense. These “commander’s intent” style statements are good to have, but I’ve never seen them
[23:36:29] <feepbot> prevent anyone from abusing a policy unless they reference specific benchmarks.
