[10:24:36] <WillPittenger> Suppose I have a class that provides a series of `System.Action<T>`, but I don't know what `T`.  That class then provides me a `System.Reflection.EventInfo` for one of the events.  How do I subscribe to it?  I'm guessing if I expand `System.Action<T>` with `object`, I'll get a runtime exception.

[11:37:22] <MatthiasVance> WillPittenger: What is your use case?
[11:42:12] <WillPittenger> Well, I'm working on a collection of objects, all of which will be the same type.  The base class used for the elements is known, but the derived class needs it's properties indexed and searchable.  So the collection needs to know when one of those properties changes.  I have `System.Reflection.PropertyInfo` instance and a matching `System.Reflection.EventInfo` instance for each property.  Technically, the delegate for the event isn't
[11:42:12] <WillPittenger> `System.Action<T>`, but rather a delegate I defined with the signature `delegate Handler<T>(DerivedElementType /*what ever that is*/ sender, T oldVal, T newVal)`.
[12:02:51] <biberu> inheritance strikes again ^^
[12:07:44] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[12:08:56] <WillPittenger> I actually don't need the `oldVal` and `newVal` parameters here.  But they're in there.  The `sender` parameter is the important one.
[12:08:58] <biberu> WillPittenger: what is an example of T?
[12:09:28] <WillPittenger> A class representing a YouTube video or playlist.
[12:11:10] <biberu> are those objects in the collection?
[12:12:46] <WillPittenger> Yes.
[12:13:00] <WillPittenger> So the date on which a video is published would be indexed.
[12:14:24] <biberu> not understanding the need for the collection to know that. can you e.g. make the objects observable and emit new index data on changes to decouple them?
[12:18:01] <biberu> WillPittenger: is the collection essentially an index -> matches?
[12:18:32] <WillPittenger> How each indexed property is sorted in the collection.

[19:35:40] <lz_> brianonymous: i'm half happy about it, i find it somewhat less responsive than 2019, and still have the same kind of bugs
[19:36:25] <lz_> + they made it harder to disable telemetry
[19:37:00] <lz_> (which always caused me freezes in itself)

[20:03:06] <edcba> yeah not sure why privacy settings are enrolling you by default in vs2022, doesn't look like RGPD compliant
[20:04:00] <Nasp> GDPR?
[20:04:05] <edcba> yeah
[20:04:12] <Nasp> Are peopel still affraid of that
[20:04:21] <Nasp> Seems like most companies don't care especially if they are small

[21:21:30] <MatthiasVance> lz_: What do you mean canceled the sale? Didn't you already have an agreement and sale?
[21:23:51] <lz_> MatthiasVance: well yes, and now he says he doesn't want to sell anymore. he's not telling me why but I guess he realized he could sell it for much more
[21:24:00] <MatthiasVance> meh
[21:24:22] <MatthiasVance> Or someone could pick it up the same day
[21:25:01] <lz_> I've been in this position of selling something and receiving litteraly dozen of messages because the thing I was selling was actually hard to find
[21:25:06] <irwiss> i mean... you either deal with that bullshit or just buy new, you pay for the guarantee of non damaged/worn out good, delivery on time and warranty...
[21:25:13] <lz_> irwiss: it's not available anywhere
[21:25:47] <irwiss> are you buying some old jank camera?
[21:25:50] <lz_> I told him that. I told him I could pay more, but I guess he won't admit the reason because he doesn't want to look like a jerk
[21:26:06] <lz_> irwiss: it's not available because of shortages
[21:33:16] <lz_> I remember seeing this model in the process of being sold and I thought to myself I could make a counter offer. I think I should have done just that
[21:33:25] <lz_> fuck that website for showing items "being sold"

[21:37:48] <lz_> the guy didn't even refund me and went offline, great, this is getting even better
[21:39:16] <lz_> ok in theory it should cancel automatically in 3 days
[21:43:26] <lz_> btw I'm pretty sure I could absolutely mess with that website by creating false profiles and selling undervalued items :D
[21:43:50] <lz_> people just look at how much similar items are sold for and reuse the same prices

[22:04:45] <lz_> I'll try to get the broken one and if that fails maybe I'll follow irwiss's advice and spend a shit ton of money
[22:05:41] <lz_> because all this is starting to just get me angry
[22:11:21] <irwiss> i mean if it's shortage you could wait a bit, "shortage" comes and goes as factories send out shipments

[22:18:21] <MatthiasVance> That's not working so well for GPUs is it
[22:22:48] <MichaelLong> is that really the case? e.g. when I look at a german retail shop for pc hardware, lots of different nvidia gpus are on stock (if we want to believe them for now).
[22:23:12] <MichaelLong> my impression is, they just kept the prices when there was the real shortage.
[22:23:23] <lz_> MichaelLong: I just checked the 3050 that was just released, already sold out
[22:23:39] <lz_> not that I would have bought it anyway, it's twice slower than my 1080
[22:24:02] <MichaelLong> https://www.alternate.de/Grafikkarten/NVIDIA-Grafikkarten was looking here, it is in german but you get the idea
[22:24:04] <lz_> I think you can find gpus, just that their retail price is 3x what it should be
[22:24:50] <MichaelLong> lz_, right but my point is, it might not be necessary due to shortages. there obviously lots of people willing to pay those prices
[22:35:13] <lz_> I'm this close >>> <<< to just order a $1000 camera
[22:35:41] <lz_> when I'm anxious I always make decisions I regret the next day :))
[22:36:42] <MichaelLong> lz_, may I ask which one? I'm also interested in that area
[22:37:09] <lz_> MichaelLong: xt30ii or xs10
[22:37:27] <MichaelLong> lz_, that's mostly not happening with me, I'm researchting stuff for days of not weeks before I make buying decisions
[22:38:16] <lz_> MichaelLong: I've been researching this for days/weeks now
[22:38:26] <lz_> MichaelLong: but my budget was <300
[22:38:35] <MichaelLong> heh
[22:38:47] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: it kinda does, i picked up 3060 ti a bit ago, it's was more expensive before and more expensive now than when i bought it :P
[22:38:58] <lz_> I was trying to find a used xf10, only options are from japan at $600+
[22:39:11] <MichaelLong> the xs10 looks interesting, the other one is more for the old shool looks
[22:39:19] <lz_> the retail price was 500
[22:39:43] <lz_> i couldn't care less about looks :D the xt30 doesn't have a stabilizer, this is why I'm not sure I want it
[22:39:53] <MichaelLong> I was planing to research the sony mirrorless ones
[22:40:25] <lz_> what I would get for spending 3x the price is 2 more megapixels, that's a meager consolation
[22:40:55] <lz_> but at least there would be a warranty etc
[22:42:19] <lz_> 50mps cameras are like $5000 anyway
[22:42:38] <lz_> maybe 3000
[22:43:36] <MichaelLong> I would not look at megapixels too much, remember your note 9 something? :)
[22:43:56] <lz_> MichaelLong: lol yeah, but that's exactly why I gave up on the idea of buying a phone :D
[22:44:09] <MichaelLong> btw. do you still have that thing?
[22:44:23] <lz_> no I returned it and lost $20 in the process
[22:44:28] <MichaelLong> ah ok
[22:44:49] <lz_> I was very dumb, I think I should have gone with it. Especially since the shots that made me lose my mind were probably done in poor lighting conditions
[22:45:10] <lz_> I still remember I was annoyed by some apparent upscaling in daylight conditions, but $200 was a fair deal
[22:46:41] <lz_> by upscaling I meant some sort of weird interpolation that didn't look natural at all when looking very close
[22:47:04] <lz_> none of that happens with a real camera, at least not with the shots I've inspected
