[02:10:43] <bdju> ugggggggggh the letter duplication in qutebrowser is driving me mad. I wish I knew what the deal was. it's like I can't just comfortable open a new tab and do a search or go to a quickmark anymore and expect it to work. there's always a pretty high chance of at least one letter getting doubled so it sends me to a search for a slightly misspelled thing
[02:10:54] <bdju> s/fortable/fortably
[02:11:15] <bdju> but if I waited for the letters to appear and then fixed any doubled letters it would take significantly longer to do anything
[02:46:32] <The-Compiler> bdju: hmm, maybe you can run with "--debug-flag log-sensitive-keys" for a bit and then do a :report (or read :messages debug yourself) to find out more
[02:47:06] <The-Compiler> bdju: I don't want to say I've never seen it the last couple of weeks, but I had some issues with bouncing keys on my keyboard, so it's hard to say what the culprit is

[06:11:09] <ml> did you previously :set backend webkit?
[06:13:55] <ml> run it explicitly with webengine, check output:  qutebrowser --backend webengine
[06:35:03] <hamblingreen[m]> it worked! thank you so much. i did not previously set it, but it said webkit was the current value. i changed it to webengine, and all is well

[09:35:15] <tent405> where are you seeing the error, which version are you running, what's your OS?
[09:37:26] <tent405> perhaps you will find more information if you launch qb from a terminal and turn on debug logging. just a suggestion.
[09:37:36] <jtgd> Arch, qute 2.4.0, I see it on the command line when I start, and also :messages
[09:37:54] <jtgd> how do I turn that on?
[09:38:35] <jtgd> command line switch?
[09:38:39] <tent405> yes
[09:39:46] <jtgd> just -d, or -D with a parm?
[09:39:56] <tent405> probs -l debug
[09:40:21] <tent405> you'll get everything. even keypresses. 
[09:40:36] <tent405> but start with verbose and filter down from there if needed
[09:42:47] <jtgd> well I can see stuff before that warning, but not sure how to interpret it. at some point it says self.set_dictionary_language so maybe something to do with spell checker
[09:42:56] <tent405> jtgd: when you installed arch did you properly follow the installation procedures for setting up your locale and such?
[09:43:05] <tent405> if it's a brand new install i'm guessing that could be the source of the problem
[09:43:11] <jtgd> yes, I think so
[09:43:42] <tent405> let's check, what is your environment variable %LANG
[09:43:45] <jtgd> do you think it could be the spell checker? that might not be all right
[09:43:46] <tent405> i mean $LANG
[09:44:37] <jtgd> dollarLANG is en_US.UTF-8
[09:44:53] <tent405> and that matches /etc/locale.conf ?
[09:45:14] <jtgd> yes
[09:45:38] <tent405>  and that matches grep -v '^#' /etc/locale.gen
[09:47:44] <jtgd> that has more lines. en_US.UTF-8 then 'en.US ISO-8859-1', then that first line 4 more times
[09:47:54] <jtgd> (I did do install a few times)
[09:48:07] <jtgd> should it just be the one line?
[09:48:46] <tent405> mine only has one line that isn't commented. if you're english only it's safe to make the entire file just have one line: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
[09:49:04] <jtgd> ok
[09:49:22] <jtgd> will qute sense that on next run or do I need to reboot?
[09:50:05] <tent405> then run locale-gen as root.
[09:50:28] <tent405> when I did this to confirm on your settings, I added the ISO line to mine, I got this error when running locale-gen:   en.ISO-8859-1...[error] cannot open locale definition file `en': No such file or directory
[09:51:12] <jtgd> done
[09:51:15] <tent405> do that then restart qutebrowser. 
[09:51:21] <tent405> see if the error comes back
[09:51:56] <jtgd> same error
[09:52:12] <jtgd> it mentions a python file
[09:53:12] <tent405> yanno what it might be a dictionary problem i'm grepping the source now
[09:53:24] <jtgd> "see scripts/dictcli.py in qutebrowser's sources"
[09:53:42] <jtgd> that sounds like spellchecker
[09:53:57] <tent405> yeah install hunspell
[09:55:12] <tent405> imma test on that too brb
[09:55:33] <jtgd> it was not installed so I did, along with the en file, but same error
[09:56:35] <tent405> I wasn't able to quickly uninstall hunspell it breaks things on mine
[09:57:13] <tent405> ok, do you want to send the debug logs to a pastebin maybe I can see something in there
[09:57:47] <jtgd> sure. where is it?
[09:58:59] <jtgd> should I just redirect the output?
[09:59:05] <tent405> ye[ i spose you could `qutebrowser -l debug 2>&1 | tee qbdebug.log`
[09:59:21] <tent405> then shutdown, start up again, send it
[09:59:48] <tent405> imma look at the source some more
[10:03:54] <tent405> webengine/spell.py is where i am
[10:07:06] <jtgd> ok
[10:08:39] <tent405> man, i need more monitors
[10:08:51] <tent405> I've been running on 2x1440 forever
[10:08:53] <hamblingreen[m]> is widevine (drm) content supported? on arch here, with the qt5-webengine-widevine package installed and qute running on the webengine backend
[10:10:06] <jtgd> http://ix.io/3Pzj
[10:11:29] <tent405> tbh the error you have is completely inocuous and could be ignored
[10:11:48] <tent405> but you could try running `scripts/dictcli.py -h` 
[10:12:15] <jtgd> please dont open that
[10:12:24] <jtgd> PLEASE
[10:12:26] <tent405> I've never even thought about spell checking unless I'm writing something conplicated :)
[10:12:29] <jtgd> I need to delete that
[10:13:24] <tent405> yeah you should probably doublecheck what you post, oof
[10:13:36] <jtgd> how do I delete that?
[10:13:54] <jtgd> fuck
[10:13:57] <jtgd> how?
[10:14:38] <tent405> that's up to what you set in ix.io 
[10:15:01] <tent405> should have a password or something to delete it
[10:16:21] <jtgd> it just says to -X DELETE but that asks for user
[10:18:15] <jtgd> their instructions dont work
[10:20:02] <jtgd> that's fucked. they don't require a user to send it but you need a user to delete it.
[10:20:32] <jasonwryan> have you tried creating a user?
[10:21:20] <jasonwryan> https://majgis.github.io/2017/09/13/Create-Authorization-Basic-Header/
[10:24:47] <jtgd> isn't it too late for that?
[10:25:41] <jtgd> I assume they mean that you uploaded the file as a user, but I didn't
[10:27:06] <tent405> Yeah idk about ix.io I always use more GUI oriented pastebins that don't require cryptic commands
[10:28:05] <jtgd> I was following advice from libera, but your advice sounds better. :)
[10:29:08] <tent405> Well, luckily you can hope that in here nobody cares because we're just a bunch of geeks using a boutique browser (the best one) trying to help eachother out
[10:30:03] <tent405> run scripts/dictcli.py and install the language pack see if that shuts it up
[10:30:33] <tent405> if not just clobber the warning in script
[10:30:46] <jtgd> yeah, qute's the best. Hopefully I can fix this tomorrow. I had no idea the debug log would spit out my whole config. You are right, I should have checked it.
[10:31:15] <tent405> you should have seen what happened to a certain donation website, got hacked, it was an ugly and stupid hack, with a massive information leak
[10:31:22] <jtgd> good old IRC, primitive, with no "unsend" :)
[10:31:25] <ktprograms> jtgd: Probably next time pipe it output to a file first
[10:32:05] <jtgd> yes yes of course, I just thought it would spit out what I was seeing on the terminal, but it was 200+kb

[18:55:47] <mparillo> You asked how I found the typo in the license file for the Bitwarden script? I started on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/ss51b5/what_web_browser_do_you_use_and_why/), and was going to add Qutebrowser, but I saw that ch33per beat me to it. Somebody asked about bitwarden integration, and ch33per replied with the link, which I followed, and the typo just jumped out at me.
