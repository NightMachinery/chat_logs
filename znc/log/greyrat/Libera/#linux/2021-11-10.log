There is no initialramfs so it won't get to a userspace, but this will prove whether that MSR is enough to get to long mode

[04:45:24] <Smashcat> Intelo: Plenty of people have results online. You can find them pretty easily. The difference is bigger based on the speed of your SSD. I have a PCIE-4 NVME drive and so its performance would be crippled using software encryption (instead of pushing data out with DMA, it has to all run through the CPU, to encrypt it first in a stream, then push it to the drive). With old mechanical drives, the
[04:45:24] <Smashcat> hardware itself is the limitation, so you'll likely not notice anything.

[07:36:49] <ayecee> the real question is how to configure a linux system to use TAI time, nothing to do with synchronization
[07:36:53] <dragonmaster> I suspect this problem has been solved by at least one 3-letter agency
[07:37:00] <Blondie101010> remote/sharing protocols use time syncing to preserve integrity, and that is what determines most of the access time
[07:37:06] <libfud> my question was what I have to worry about when it comes to leap seconds, and I think the answer is that it may depend on what chrony does

[11:01:07] <hexnewbie> royaljelly: I've almost never used tar -J, because I like specifying compression level. There might be a slight difference on how the file is opened (tar may do safety check that the destination file does not exist or something, which a shell redirect does not), but nothing significant.

[17:31:20] <BSaboia>  ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh(1) to log into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so
[17:31:20] <BSaboia>      password authentication should be enabled, unless you've done some clever use of multiple identities).

[17:31:50] <Yonle> Well, wireshark is good
[17:32:01] <SpeakerToMeat> BSaboia, ssh-copy-id does need a way to log in the remote user to be able to insert the key you're asking for. So either password, or a different key
[17:32:11] <ananke> BSaboia: what's the actual question here?

[17:36:00] <SpeakerToMeat> BSaboia, if this fails, ssh-copy-id is basically a script on ssh to do this the easy and right way, but you can perform the same effect by doing it by hand.
[17:36:32] *** Joins: Iamthehuman (~noname@user/iamthehuman)
[17:36:36] <BSaboia> SpeakerToMeat, yeah, I know. But it would be nice to automate this part
[17:37:02] <SpeakerToMeat> BSaboia, doing it by hand means, 1) log in the remote system. 2) verify .ssh/authorized_keys exists and is permed 600 (rw-------), create and chmod if not. 3) copy the contents of yourkey.pub on a line inside that file.
[17:37:09] <SpeakerToMeat> Yeah
[17:37:17] <BSaboia> I also see that ssh-copy-id has a -o thing that should probably accept the IdentityFile directive

[20:07:39] <Xeroine> wigums: I did "dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/somefile count=8000000" which gives me like a 4 GB file and the "free" column in "free -h" reduced by that amount
[20:07:40] <tusko> they don't know how good they could have it with a real language, like C
[20:07:47] <blackgatonegro> Is Rust safer? Easier? Is harder to data leak? Does it have more robust code and good error handling?
[20:07:54] <Xeroine> wigums: that should mean it's in RAM right?

[20:08:36] <tusko> blackgatonegro, the idea is that it is memory safe and thread safe by default. LIke, you're not supposed to be able to have memory leaks in rust
[20:08:41] <blackgatonegro> tusko most people actually use a C derivative due to limitations with plain C or use C with something else.
[20:08:45] <Xeroine> wdym what would I check in fstab?

For those that do not know, golang is a statically compiled single binary with the language containing all the libraries so there is no calling out to shared libraries. However, due to the nature of K8S tooling those binaries often need to talk to the Linux
[20:59:38] <TJ-> kernel. That means syscalls. They found that caused so much trouble that some tools have been rewritten in C - and those C tools have codebases that are smaller, faster, and much easier to reason about.

Anything special I need to do to provision this?  It's this PHY: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L6PQ6I2 and I'm runnning 5.10.17.  The other 3 ports on the i350 have hardwired RJ45's and work fine out-of-the-box.

[23:56:20] <PowerMan2206> Also a VPN ain't an option

[23:56:28] <Psi-Jack> VPN is always an option.

[23:57:35] <xx> samba doesn't even force-encrypt by default
[23:57:40] <jason1234> the easiest is probably the jailkit, make sure to remove /bin/bash into /etc/passwd
