[05:00:30] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> Happy New Year!!
[05:01:56] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> This is a new feature. Maybe this option should support list. (re @kauesena: Hi, everyone! I wonder how can I set both jk and kj as key bindings to escape insert mode. I haven't seen any mention to escape_key_binding  accepting more then one value and did not find any option to make the order of the escape sequence not matter.)
[05:04:17] <SpaceVimBot> <Mr_Cthulhu> Happy new year to you too âœ¨ðŸŽ‰ (re @wsdjeg: Happy New Year!!)
[05:06:28] <SpaceVimBot> <kauesena> Not yet here in Brazil. But Happy New Year everyone.
[05:08:19] <SpaceVimBot> <kauesena> Hm. I did not know it was a new feature. It is natural to wonder if that variable could be a list. I even tried it but to no avail. (re @wsdjeg: This is a new feature. Maybe this option should support list.)
[05:09:56] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> Okï¼Œ will check it (re @kauesena: Hm. I did not know it was a new feature. It is natural to wonder if that variable could be a list. I even tried it but to no avail.)
