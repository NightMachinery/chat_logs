[09:06:00] <bullgard4> LjL, Thank you. --  Does tinsoldier map one by one the English Wiktionary? (I could test that by testing a lot of example terms and verify or falsify this hypothesis. This would take much time. Do you know this more preecisely and can tell me please?
[09:07:02] <LjL> i don't run this bot, so i don't know it "precisely", but why would it use Wiktionary's definitions sometimes and sometimes not?
[09:07:26] <LjL> obviously it doesn't post the *whole* content of the Wiktionary page, as it would be too long. it posts the definitions that fit, and a link
[09:09:00] <bullgard4> LjL is a huge »institution«. And I like to use smaller and more precise tools in my work if I have an alternative.

[09:10:39] <snappy> wish there was a dictd/dict.org bot, but that dict protocol is pretty terrible
[09:11:30] <bullgard4> snappy, I agree with you. But sometimes dict is very handy.
[09:12:06] <snappy> yeah the dictionaries that come with are high quality
[09:13:29] <LjL> i tried making a dict bot in the past, but the dictionaries are pretty much freeform text, not very amenable to "extracting" for IRC (Wiktionary is pretty terrible too in that respect, because it's structured data in an unstructured format, so you basically have to write a different bot for each language's wiktionary if you want to use more than just the English one)
[09:19:11] <bullgard4> LjL, My deference to you! (Or should I have said "My obeisance to you!"?)
