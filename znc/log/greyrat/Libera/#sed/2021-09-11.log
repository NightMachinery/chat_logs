[18:50:54] <[R]> I have a sed sript that uses -i to edit a file, I want to delete every line once it finds a specific pattern, but I'm not sure how to do that (I'm already doing other things once it finds that pattern)
[18:51:35] <[R]> If it helps, this is guaranteed to be running GNU sed
[18:58:57] <emanuele6> [R]: sed -i '/my_pattern/ n' my_file
[19:00:06] <emanuele6> oh, it doesn't work
[19:01:13] <[R]> That doesn't do anything
[19:01:29] <emanuele6> yeah, i forgot sed commands :P
[19:01:33] <emanuele6> sed -i '/my_pattern/ d' my_file
[19:01:36] <emanuele6> this should work
[19:01:43] <[R]> I think I'm best off using a temp file and q
[19:01:50] <[R]> That just deletes the one line
[19:02:04] <emanuele6> that deletes all the lines that match my_pattern?
[19:02:09] <emanuele6> isn't that what you want?
[19:02:21] <[R]> No, it just deletes the one line
[19:03:22] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' line{1..10} | sed '/1/ d' | tr '\n' ' '
[19:03:23] <shbot> emanuele6: line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8 line9
[19:03:38] <emanuele6> no, every line that matches /1/
[19:03:46] <emanuele6> i also tried it locally on a file
[19:03:50] <[R]> Yeah
[19:03:59] * [R] is using the tempfile and q route now
[19:07:19] <emanuele6> i don't understand what you want  
[19:07:33] <emanuele6> [R]: this? sed -i '/my_pattern/ Q' my_file
[19:08:03] <[R]> q and Q don't work with -i
[19:08:55] <[R]> So now I'm doing: `sed '/pattern/ { /* bunch of things */ ; q }' $file > $file.tmp; mv $file.tmp $file
[19:09:15] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' line{1..30} > my_file; tr '\n' ' ' my_file; sed -i '/5/ q' my_file; tr '\n' ' ' my_file
[19:09:21] <shbot> emanuele6: tr: extra operand 'my_file'
[19:09:21] <shbot> emanuele6: Try 'tr --help' for more information.
[19:09:21] <shbot> emanuele6: etc... ( http://ix.io/3yzk )
[19:09:26] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' line{1..30} > my_file; tr '\n' ' ' < my_file; sed -i '/5/ q' my_file; tr '\n' ' ' my_file

[19:09:55] <emanuele6> q does work
[19:10:01] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' line{1..30} > my_file; tr '\n' ' ' < my_file; echo; sed -i '/5/ q' my_file; tr '\n' ' ' < my_file

[19:10:03] <shbot> emanuele6: line1 line2 line3 line4 line5
[19:10:53] <[R]> I had q in it from when I was testing it and just dumping the result to stdout, but when I switch to -i it was still keeping all the data after that match
[19:11:00] <emanuele6> q includes line5, Q does not include line5
[19:11:31] <emanuele6> what is the exact command you are using?
[19:12:14] <[R]> https://termbin.com/tm2w
[19:19:08] <emanuele6> interesting
[19:19:58] <emanuele6> if you move `q' before `c \', it deletes all the lines that match `#[testing]' and it does not replace them 
[19:20:46] <emanuele6> could this be a bug?
[19:22:30] <emanuele6> i guess it treats `q' as `d'
[19:22:40] <emanuele6> but it does not do it in my example
[19:22:40] <[R]> i and Q together work with -i
[19:22:52] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' line{1..10} > my_file; tr '\n' ' ' < my_file; echo; sed -i '/5/ q' my_file; tr '\n' ' ' < my_file
[19:22:54] <shbot> emanuele6: line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8 line9 line10 
[19:22:54] <shbot> emanuele6: line1 line2 line3 line4 line5
[19:23:07] <[R]> Thanks for making me look deeper into this emanuele6
[19:23:33] <emanuele6> maybe, since `c \' adds new lines, it confuses it somehow
