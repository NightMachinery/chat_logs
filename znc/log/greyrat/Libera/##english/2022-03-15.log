[11:28:20] <twb> Hrm... how do you refer to false nails, when "falsies" already means eyelashes?
[11:28:50] <GuiToris> !d falsies
[11:28:52] <tinsoldier> falsies — Noun: 1. plural of falsie https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsies
[11:28:56] <GuiToris> !d falsie
[11:28:57] <tinsoldier> falsie — Noun: 1. (colloquial, chiefly in the plural) Padding worn inside a brassiere to make the breasts appear larger or appear to exist., 2. (colloquial, chiefly in the plural) A false eyelash, used as a cosmetic enhancement. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsie
[11:29:51] <GuiToris> so falsie could also be fake hair on breasts
[11:30:35] <twb> There's a quote from someone like Oscar Wilde (but younger) where he takes a woman home and she takes off her false everythings and disappears
[11:31:51] <GuiToris> I'm not really into these types of girls. I had a girl who had false eyelashes from time to time, but it wasn't typical
[11:32:13] <GuiToris> especially if they are long, or obvious it ruins their intelligence
[11:32:27] <twb> I lived with a model and a burlesque dancer once
[11:32:45] <twb> It's an awful lot of work to do all that stuff, I know that much
[11:33:08] <twb> Also models have to get up at like 3AM because they have to drive out to somewhere scenic before the sun comes up
[11:35:22] <GuiToris> I found the word 'model' misleading. She may have been beautiful, but a lot of times they are just interesting, which isn't necessarily attractive.
[11:35:46] <GuiToris> Most female models are not feminine
[11:36:29] <twb> well I've only known two.  In my experience they were just people, doing a job
[11:36:45] <GuiToris> but it's quite surprising what you are saying. Getting up at 3am? I thought they sleep and rest a lot so they could preserve their looks
[11:39:16] <GuiToris> I looked up who's the richest model: https://cdn.wealthygorilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Richest-Models-Slavica-Ecclestone.webp
[11:39:48] <GuiToris> when I saw her, I didn't say WOW, she's such a woman :O
[11:39:55] <twb> GuiToris: it's similar to acting.  For an outdoor shoot, you have to be there when the light is there
[11:40:17] <twb> For an indoor set you can be more flexible
[11:40:27] <GuiToris> yeah I know, that's my original profession

[12:56:15] <twb> "no effort" not "no efforts"

[12:59:36] <hiya> Is this more effective?
[13:00:52] <twb> Well 
[13:01:01] <twb> Well "super easy" is a bit informal.  I suggest "trivial"
[13:01:49] <hiya> It is for an audience who might know basic English only.
[13:01:57] <hiya> For trivial they might have to do a web search
[13:02:04] <twb> OK.
[13:02:13] <twb> "very easy" then
[13:10:02] <hans> super mega ultra trivial

[17:59:01] <xau> Jmabsd -- some candidate words to denote "one particular constellation of participants": "subdivion", "subset", or "subgroup".  Also possible, depending upon usage and context: "coterie", "contingent", "cadre", "cluster", "clutch", "knot".  "Contingent" and "clutch" and "knot" can convey unwitting implications as they have alternate entirely different kinds of meanings as well.  
[18:00:59] <xau> A clutch of monarchists.  The king clutched his scepter.  A knot of executioners.  The executioner tied the knot.  A contingent of logicians planned to attend, contingent upon payment of expenses.
[18:04:00] <xau> Do you have a specific context you need a word for?  If so, perhaps share a sample sentence, and we could take one or two candidates for a test drive.
[18:06:22] <Jmabsd> xau: decentralization generally
[18:06:29] <Jmabsd> to describe it
[18:07:04] <xau> I prefer: "The King", but have been demoralized in recent years into downgrading to lower case, by examples in journalism plus bits of mockery I've received.
[18:07:18] <xau> ok Jmabsd
[18:09:45] <xau> In that case, "subset" should work, generally.
[18:11:09] <xau> Where and why to capitalize "king" (or not) is a little bit interesting, to me anyway.
[18:12:13] <xau> blkshp: is there a received view here with regard to: "anyways".  Accursed or admitted?

[18:17:53] <GuiToris> !ddg rialto
[18:17:56] <tinsoldier> Rialto were an English rock band formed in London in 1997. They released their self-titled debut album in 1998, followed by their second and final album, Night on Earth, in 2001. Their single "Untouchable" reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_(band)&amp;rut=46b7ee8905b4d0e0f2f9a35ad02ee4e0159cf957fe0f1d47c3d33a5e1a2b7de6
[18:19:17] <xau> "What news on the Rialto" is literary allusion that has standing as a colloquialism, GuiToris.  
[18:20:50] <xau> It's a line from Shakespeare, from "The Merchant of Venice".  It means in the way I used it: "what's happening?", "what's new", and even "how are you?".
[18:21:34] <GuiToris> It's too late, I've already ordered 2 copies of their Album

[21:51:14] <Bayes> idk IRC is hard
[21:51:17] <LjL> that's not at all how an IRC channel is ever stylized, so no :P
[21:52:42] <LuisR14> yo, nick spamming over at #LjL
[21:52:58] * LuisR14 :>
[21:53:06] <Bayes> LjL how is it stylized then?
[21:53:21] <Bayes> username@clientid/network
[21:53:43] <Bayes> username@##English/network
[21:53:52] <Bayes> LuisR14@##English/libera.chat ?
[21:54:37] <Bayes> maybe just username at libera.chat and leave out the channel since, well, you're referencing the user

[21:57:55] <LjL> Bayes, it really isn't, there isn't a standard thing for it. there is irc:// urls but i don't think they can refer to nicknames on channels
[21:58:37] <LjL> wow, i googled "irc urls" and one of the questions google suggests is "is IRC illegal?" :|

[22:22:32] <skyfall> Is "should have been" correct in this sentence? : Hitler should have been killed as a fetus during his mother's pregnancy.
[22:22:37] <skyfall>  I'm not sure if "should be been" is grammatically correct here. The sentence expresses an "ideal past" condition. Can we use "should have" in that case?

[22:58:31] <terminalpusher> wait a minute do you actually spell "50 euros" as €50 if you spelled it with the symbol just like with dollars?
[22:58:38] <terminalpusher> like instead of 50€ it's €50
[22:58:58] <terminalpusher> do you do that for all currencies and not just dollars? To put the symbol at the start
[22:59:35] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414)
[23:00:51] <terminalpusher> but then again "fifty cent" is 50c right?

[23:41:48] <Jmabsd> If you have a means of communication (telephony, networking whatever) that internally is multi-tiered, redundant, robust, so that it will work even in the presence of some internal malfunction like broken network links,
[23:42:07] <Jmabsd> what do you call that - *secure* is a bit too general maybe, secure as in that it *secures* the functioning/availability of the route
[23:42:15] <Jmabsd> *robust* is a good word but it may be insufficinet
[23:44:14] <Jmabsd> robust means if you beat it it'll still work
[23:44:48] <Jmabsd> will work in adversarial conditions
[23:45:48] <Jmabsd> maybe "reliable" is better than "secure"
