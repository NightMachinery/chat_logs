[00:38:59] <mags> Is there some way to set an absolute pixel width for monospace fonts?  ie. I have font Hack 14px, but every other character is a different width (8px, 9px, 8px, 9px, ...) in Firefox for me.
[00:40:31] <hassoon_> sgen: what is it
[00:40:32] <mags> Strangely, when I set font Hack 10pt, every character is exactly 8px wide, like I want.  I thought you should stay away from pt, though.  Ultimately, trying to get my website to render exactly as a terminal.

[01:16:38] <eXtr3m0> mags seems like font-weight:bold has an effect on your boxes
[01:17:07] <eXtr3m0> mags I like your 404 page. :D
[01:21:06] <mags> I never thought of bold being an issue, messing around with it now ...
[01:22:15] <mags> for reference, the boxes look fine in Firefox on linux, but have always been in issue in Windows, as is the ascii art
[01:25:33] <eXtr3m0> interesting
[01:25:52] <eXtr3m0> you use arch btw?
[01:26:06] <mags> well, what gave that away, lol
[01:26:21] <eXtr3m0> :D just riding on those meme waves
[01:27:40] <mags> sometimes Debian, gonna make a guide for that too one of these days
[01:28:01] <eXtr3m0> text-transform: full-width;
[01:28:13] <eXtr3m0> with that enabled it also the bold version seems to work
[01:28:20] <eXtr3m0> windows,firefox
[01:29:17] <eXtr3m0> https://caniuse.com/?search=full-width seems like a firefox only feature.
[01:30:37] <eXtr3m0> full-width: Is a keyword that forces the writing of a character — mainly ideograms and Latin scripts — inside a square, allowing them to be aligned in the usual East Asian scripts (like Chinese or Japanese).
[01:35:54] <eXtr3m0> font-synthesis: small-caps. With that you get chrome/firefofx/safari , 60% of market share
[01:37:37] <eXtr3m0> mags best would be if you just choose another font for your boxes for example. the root cause of the issue seems to be the font, because when I switch it to font-family: monospace; it works fine.
[01:41:40] <mags> right now I'm messing around with boxes out of images to emulate ascii boxes, and so I don't have to write out boxes manually, it seems to working well

[01:48:46] <eXtr3m0> looking at your content, I'd give it max-width: 80ch or max-width: 120ch :D
[01:49:16] <mags> Take a look at the non-test version: mags.nsupdate.info/arch-usb.html  If you resize the screen, some of larger code boxes will word wrap.
[01:51:09] <mags> well, I'll be, the bold->normal weight fixed the issue on windows
[01:51:19] <eXtr3m0> But then suddenly a \ appears at the and of the line and a : at the start?!

[01:57:39] <eXtr3m0> Did you check out border-image?
[01:57:48] <eXtr3m0> I haven't used it, but it could be handy
[01:58:33] <mags> yeah, I got it working, on the test site: https://mags.nsupdate.info/bindi/arch-usb_2.html  the main nav box on the right is a border image, not text
[01:59:25] <eXtr3m0> Ah. it looks a bit different, kinda smoother, but I wouldn't have guessed.
[02:00:08] <eXtr3m0> just from this image it's being generated? https://mags.nsupdate.info/border.png
[02:00:17] <mags> that's how all this text width fiasco got started, to make the css boxes look exactly like the surrounding text, the surrounding text has to be a constant fixed width.
[02:00:28] <mags> yup, that's the image I'm working with
[02:00:31] <eXtr3m0> This is actually incredible. I wasn't aware CSS does that.
[02:01:17] <mags> Oh, it took a bit of messing around to figure out exactly how it worked, but I think I have a decent working system for now
[02:01:26] <eXtr3m0> hey maybe one tip: does it make sense to scale your stuff in "ch" instead of px?
[02:01:55] <eXtr3m0> 1ch = width of character '0'
[02:02:00] <eXtr3m0> (zero)
[02:02:10] <mags> hmm... looking into it.

[02:18:39] <eXtr3m0> Absolute length units are generally considered to always be the same size.
[02:18:55] <eXtr3m0> Just gave a div width:10cm and measure 8,9cm with a ruler
[02:19:30] <eXtr3m0> I think that assumption that "it's the same length everywhere" might have been claimed when everybody just got 640x480 or 800x600.

[02:22:49] <eXtr3m0> it comes from the print world.
[02:23:43] <eXtr3m0> But this page is also saying that pt = 1/72th of 1in. So with a 72DPI screen it would be pixel perfect?
[02:24:35] <mags> Basically I want the exact same size font for my entire site, so relative sizing isn't something I'll probably use.
[02:25:04] <eXtr3m0> cool thing is though that you can use rem units also as width / height / padding / margin etc.
[02:25:11] <eXtr3m0> thats more the point I guess.
[02:25:29] <mags> sure sure, I'll use that for padding in my boxes
[02:25:29] <eXtr3m0> so if you change one value on your html code, the whole app will scale and not only the text
[02:25:39] <eXtr3m0> I see

[07:59:14] <FunkyBob> you'd want to fix your broken HTML first...
[07:59:31] <FunkyBob> you left out the </span>
[08:00:09] <FunkyBob> you can use the same margin: auto; approach I showed you in other places
[08:00:12] <FunkyBob> `center @ quartz
[08:00:12] <Selvvir> quartz, How to center anything: https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
[08:01:53] <quartz> FunkyBob: OK I'll try it
[08:06:45] <quartz> FunkyBob: Is the article > header trick count as using "inline" style tag?
[08:06:58] <FunkyBob> sorry?
[08:07:10] <FunkyBob> which bit of that is a trick?
[08:07:28] <FunkyBob> do you me a style attribute?  like when you put style="..." on an element?
[08:07:56] <FunkyBob> or are you asking about what the > means in the selector?
[08:08:36] <quartz> The assignment says I can't use any inline style tags
[08:08:49] <quartz> I was just wondering if that means I can't use the >
[08:08:52] <FunkyBob> no, we're not using any inline styles
[08:09:03] <FunkyBob> no... inline styles are styles in the HTML itself
[08:09:26] <FunkyBob> if you don't understand that... then either it's a shitty course, or you needed to pay more attention
[08:09:57] <quartz> It's both the course and me that are the problem lol
[08:10:43] <FunkyBob> if you put, for instance, <span style="color: red;" > ... that would be inline styles
[08:10:54] <FunkyBob> call it inline style "tags" is wrong, though
[08:10:59] <FunkyBob> fuck me, that lightning was close
[08:11:54] <quartz> FunkyBob: Ok thanks for the clarification.
[08:12:04] <quartz> Where are you located?

[08:37:14] <FunkyBob> depends on which 'it' you were trying to do
[08:37:23] <quartz> The spacing, without using <br>
[08:37:29] <FunkyBob> make the text go on separate lines?  why not put it in a <p> instead of <span>
[08:37:37] <FunkyBob> to add spacing between elements? there's margin
[08:37:52] <FunkyBob> either way, you've tried to cram _presentational_ choices into the HTML...

[08:42:08] <FunkyBob> if we make the top/bottom margin of your .button 2rem...
[08:42:21] <FunkyBob> and wrap that content on a <p>
[08:46:45] <FunkyBob> so, yeah... you can add space around elements by giving them some _margin_
[08:48:18] <FunkyBob> oh that's interesting...
[08:48:51] <FunkyBob> height on a button appears to set its box height... but on the flex'd div you had, it's content height...
[08:49:22] <FunkyBob> yah... different box-sizing defaults

[13:24:21] <hmw[at]> Andrew: Using body (or even html) is mostly no difference. There is some odd special effect with border collapse and those two elements, but besides that, they are just normal elements.
[13:25:02] <hmw[at]> I always use html and body as wrappers, and can thus save adding divs.

[20:41:51] <pgnd> In the case of a site that ONLY defines its own @font-face/woff2 fonts, and uses no externally-sourced fonts, is there any reason to continue use of fontstacks, rather than simply/explicitly define font-family: as the local @font-face/woff2 font?

[21:02:27] <nbjoerg> pgnd: well, the normal idea is to give the "regular" font name and then reference the woff2 version
[21:02:44] <nbjoerg> pgnd: so if the user has it installed locally, it is used, otherwise it fetches the resource

[21:05:27] <pgnd> nbjoerg: in this case, it's a rather specifically defined uncommon & *variable* font.  the user would never likely have it locally to begin with, let alone match.
[21:05:32] <boris[m]> Hello everyone ! Can someone help me make the widget fill the whole page ? https://codepen.io/atomtm/pen/NWwqLMj
[21:05:32] <boris[m]> The widget size is set to auto so based on the instructions on tradingview (https://www.tradingview.com/widget/advanced-chart/) it will take 100% of the space of the enclosing element
[21:06:10] <nbjoerg> pgnd: in that case, the only reason you might want to bother is if you care about browsers without woff2 support
[21:07:27] <nbjoerg> boris[m]: I'm not sure I understand the problem? except using 140% will force scrolling of course
[21:08:29] <pgnd> nbjoerg: yeah, that one I figured.  for this work, I'm jettisoning legacy support .... for my interests, this -- https://caniuse.com/woff2 -- is goof enuf.   Then, unless I'm missing something, sounds like I can drop the stacks 'safely', and insist on use of the delivered woff2 from my site.
[21:09:21] <nbjoerg> unless it is a specical purpose font, I think I'd still include a fallback, but yeah, otherwise it is reasonable

[21:15:47] <pgnd> nbjoerg: I'm waffling on the fallbacks.
[21:15:47] <pgnd> I'm matching an available 'free' var font as closely as possible to Typekit fonts from existing design; trying to get rid of Adobe ...
[21:15:47] <pgnd> The var font has some uncommon wdth/wght/letter-spacing which won't correctly mod a fallback, if it applies at all.  So a fallback ends up "looking really terrible".
[21:15:47] <pgnd> I'm trying to wrap my head around under what conditions my served font wouldn't be available/used, and what -- other than fallback -- to do if that's the case (js messaging? dunno ...)
[21:16:40] <boris[m]> Nboerg currently the graph is limited in the 1/4 of the page. How can I make it take the whole screen . Also by having an autosize option  I would expect this to be also  responsive
[21:25:57] <nbjoerg> boris[m]: your problem is ultimately the inner iframe
