[03:26:51] <aphysically> I see

[03:28:14] <BtbN> I don't want to send srt
[03:28:19] <BtbN> I want to receive it, like nginx-rtmp.
[03:28:35] <aphysically> yes, I switched from nginx-rtmp to this actually
[03:28:54] <BtbN> what you describe is the opposite way around from nginx-rtmp
[03:31:25] <aphysically> I don't know what you're imagining, the server isn't capable of sending, only receiving
[03:31:45] <BtbN> It'd be fed from OBS, via srt

[03:31:59] <aphysically> I've literally fed it from OBS
[03:32:10] <BtbN> you just said it's only an srt transmitter?
[03:34:20] <aphysically> anyway I was trying to fix the server to work with av1 now, but I imagine it's going to have the same problem the sending side does
[03:34:38] <aphysically> ffmpeg doesn't support the av1 in mpegts yet so it would choke on the input I assume
[03:34:41] <aphysically> but I don
[03:34:52] <BtbN> AV1 in mpeg-ts is not specified, and ffmpeg does not normally implement off-spec stuff
[03:34:55] <aphysically> but I don't have any non-ffmpeg way to try sending valid av1-in-mpegts so I couldn't test it
[03:35:35] <aphysically> I don't know what makes a spec official or not, but AOM has one: https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/av1-mpeg2-ts
[03:35:54] <BtbN> it being official, not something some random person/group came up with
[03:36:02] <aphysically> well, they do claim it's official
[03:36:28] <BtbN> I see no ISO/IEC standard for it
[03:36:43] <BtbN> it's just something aomedia has cooked up, it's not official mpeg stuff
[03:36:46] <aphysically> so then that answers my question what you'd consider official
[03:36:56] <BtbN> What else would you consider official?
[03:37:04] <BtbN> it needs to be officially specified to be part of mpeg-ts

[03:39:01] <BtbN> You can't just interpret random data as video stream
[03:39:16] <BtbN> you need to know the format it's packaged as, where/how to get the codec extradata, and so on

[07:52:41] <aphysically> znf: nvidia's 10bit hevc encoder is pretty good
[07:52:58] <aphysically> but I think their avc encoder is often better than their 8 bit hevc encoder
[07:53:08] <aphysically> their 8 bit hevc encoder is just entirely bugged, I think
[07:53:21] <znf> I can't use HEVC :)
[07:55:30] <aphysically> their rc-lookahead encoding parameter was bugged in nvenc until a few driver versions ago, but I haven't had a chance to retest it since they changed/fixed it
[07:55:54] <aphysically> it worked like a boolean option where everything >=1 had the same output, which definitely contradicts all their documentation
[07:56:06] <aphysically> but a few driver versions ago that changed (without changelog mentioning it anywhere......)
[07:56:14] <aphysically> and now it's doing something again
[07:58:31] <aphysically> BtbN: it looks like mpegts can't package vp9 either, but there doesn't seem to be any effort to provide a way to do it like there is with av1
[08:00:06] <aphysically> so the valid things to stream over srt that might conceivably be used in practice are, like, {avc, hevc} and {aac, opus, mp3}, I guess
[08:00:19] <aphysically> where only avc and aac/opus are well supported if you're going to try packaging into dash+hls
[08:00:24] <aphysically> (for web)
[08:00:49] <aphysically> browsers have problems with mp3 in mp4, but there may be some other weird stuff that work like MPEG2 (..?)
[08:01:50] <aphysically> all things considered I'm surprised opus managed to clear all the hurdles to be (mostly) working
[08:02:46] <aphysically> I should look into if people have tried alternatives to mpegts for srt packaging
[08:04:47] <aphysically> if I'm not using mpegts I have to recalculate all this payload size nonsense
[08:09:14] <aphysically> I don't even know what I would use instead of mpegts; ...can't mkv be streamed?
[08:15:32] <johnjaye> i've never heard of that

[08:18:46] <aphysically> hmmm maybe I could look into that if I could figure out the correct packet size to use
[08:20:27] <aphysically> mpegts is 1316 because it's the most 188 byte sections that can fit into 1500 MTU while leaving room for the header
[08:27:28] <aphysically> iirc I tried mkv over mpegts a year or two ago and while it didn't not work at all, I think I ran into a showstopper of I-don't-remember-what
[08:28:36] <aphysically> I could always try fmp4
[08:28:52] <aphysically> I limited by what fmp4 supports on the dash/hls side anyway

[09:15:59] <aphysically> I wonder if the decimate filter will work well on things animated on 2s
[09:16:36] <aphysically> I think there's some 29.970 stuff that's native 24.976 floating around, but I would think being animated on 2s would muck up the decimate filter
[09:16:43] <aphysically> not sure if there's a better solution
[09:17:39] <aphysically> although maybe because of the ranking it still works fine and drops the frame that's most-duplicated
[09:17:49] <aphysically> not sure how decimate actually works :)
[09:17:55] <aphysically> let's make some animated wrong fps stuff and try it
[09:34:12] <aphysically> if decimate can detect frames duplicated more than 2 times and favor removing that one then it will probably be fine, if it only removes one of the two most similar frames it will probably cause horrible judder :D

[10:36:57] <aphysically> oh geez this is a headache
[10:37:14] <aphysically> what's the best way to offset picsubs in time without extracting to a separate file....
[10:37:54] <aphysically> can I do something like setpts=PTS+some_number/TB
[10:37:58] <aphysically> or -some_number
[10:38:33] <furq> yes
[10:38:38] <furq> setpts,subtitles,setpts
[10:38:57] <furq> actually idk if that works for image subtitles
[10:39:01] <furq> obviously the middle bit doesn't
[10:39:31] <aphysically> let's find out
[10:39:48] <aphysically> I need to do like 400 ms hmm
[10:40:33] <aphysically> furq: for text subs I actually _always_ extract them to a separate file, otherwise it doesn't really work with streaming because of the way initialization can take arbitrarily long amounts of time
[10:40:40] <aphysically> so I can just trivially retime while extracting
[10:40:44] <aphysically> the interesting case is image subs
[10:40:55] <aphysically> where I'm not currently extracting it (and I'd like to avoid it if I don't need to!)
[10:45:36] <aphysically> wow it's making a corrupt video file :D
[10:48:30] <aphysically> I don't know I can't seem to get it right between setpts and the video overlay

[21:33:21] <gitautas> Hey guys, I was wondering for a more appropriate channel to ask about codec efficiency. I'm working on a personal project where I need a low latency solution for video encoding and decoding. I already support H264 since consumer GPUs have hardware encoders for them that are very fast, I was wondering how do Intel Quicksync/AMD CPU encoders compare
[21:33:22] <gitautas> when encoding vp8 in terms of encoding speed?
[21:33:40] <gitautas> If this is not the right channel perhaps someone could point me to a more appropriate one.
[21:35:01] <BtbN> I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
[21:35:14] <BtbN> Yes, hwencs are fast, but have comparaitviely poor quality as tradeoff
[21:36:19] <gitautas> Here quality comes second to encoding speed. I'm building an open source cloud gaming infrastructure and am considering if it's worth targeting browsers that cannot support H264.
[21:36:38] <BtbN> You'd have go to back a decare or more to find a browser like that.
[21:37:56] <gitautas> Well, in the case of MacOS Chromium doesn't support it by default and it's behind a flag on firefox.
[21:37:59] <gitautas> But that is a fair point.
[21:40:16] <BtbN> Browsers on OSX don't support h264? I have trouble believing that oO
[21:41:34] <xerox> they do, have for a long while
[21:42:21] <gitautas> I might be misinformed, either way in that case I can target H264 and forget about VP8.
[21:42:57] <BtbN> I've never heard of a vp8 hwenc anway. And quality would be piss poor
[21:45:16] <gitautas> Thanks for the help guys, sorry for not doing my full due diligence

[22:13:43] <kepstin> are you talking about normal video playback or webrtc?
[22:13:54] <kepstin> because support is different for those :/

[22:17:24] <gitautas> kepstin: WebRTC in this case

[22:19:12] <kepstin> right, i think safari still might not support vp9 in webrtc. at this point h264 should work with webrtc in all major browsers, with the note that firefox might be using openh264 on some platforms, which limits you to ... either constrained baseline or main, can't remember.
[22:20:43] <kepstin> so yeah, only two codecs you can really consider for webrtc are vp8 and h264 constrained baseline. and of the two, use h264 unless you have a reason to avoid it.
[22:21:21] <gitautas> That's what I've been operating with, I thought it'd be worth coming up with a VP8 MVP to see how much latency is introduced.

[22:24:04] <kepstin> i wouldn't expect vp8 format to cause any issues with latency itself. like h264 constrained baseline, there's no frame re-ordering, so the encoders/decoders can operate one-frame-in, one-frame-out.
[22:24:13] <kepstin> but browser implementation quality may vary :)
[22:25:45] <gitautas> Well for this use case the latency inducing part would be the additions of copying the raw video to CPU memory and encoding it in the CPU, but it's impossible to say how much that would add without trying
