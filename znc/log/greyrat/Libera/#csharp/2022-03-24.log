[00:18:01] <CoderGuy> I know I should give it a rest i've already solved this but
[00:18:43] <CoderGuy> just curious other then dynamic is there a way to set int[][] or int[][][] based on a value? Other then having like a bunch of potential cases to choose from?
[00:19:05] <CoderGuy> because int[][][][] or int[][][][][][]
[00:20:06] <Nasp> Suchiman:  nice
[00:20:08] <CoderGuy> is there anyway to say like size 3, or size 4
[00:20:12] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: other than using like a SingleOrArray<T> with implicit casting and then using SingleOrArray<int>, no
[00:20:21] <CoderGuy> oh okay
[00:20:35] <CoderGuy> but even in the single or array exmaple you'd have a limited list of it
[00:20:52] <CoderGuy> I guess unless you type out every single one but it's infinite so lol
[00:20:57] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: well... or using object[] where you then have to type check if (arr[0] is object[] arr) { } else { arr[0] is int i }
[00:21:14] <Suchiman> basically dynamic but the manual way :P
[00:21:28] <CoderGuy> ic so ultimately just dynamic is the only way
[00:21:37] <CoderGuy> wait what's the manual way of it doing this?
[00:21:42] <Cecen> Does anyone know off the top of their head if ASP.NET Core serves requests using the main thread pool?
[00:22:17] <CoderGuy> I guess I can just google what dynamic does but
[00:26:24] <JakeSays> dynamic does evil things
[00:27:32] <CoderGuy> sure but how?
[00:31:35] *** Quits: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy) (Read error: No route to host)
[00:32:26] <ki9a> yeah how so JakeSays?
[00:32:40] <ki9a> you as a php and perl lover should like Dynamic
[00:33:00] <CoderGuy> like what is dynamic doing where you can have dynamic a = new dynamic[]; but then a[0] = new dynamic[];
[00:33:25] <ki9a> dynamic jumps through hoops
[00:33:37] <CoderGuy> right but what's one way that it does this? why can it do this?
[00:33:53] <CoderGuy> I just wanna know that part, how does it somehow make a[0] a new dynamic[];
[00:34:14] <ki9a> dynamic works in a few cases
[00:34:23] <CoderGuy> right but how?
[00:34:28] <ki9a> if the target or source is dynamic
[00:34:39] <ki9a> or in a call if this, or any of the arguments is dynamic
[00:34:49] <ki9a> thats when it goes through dyndispatch
[00:35:18] <CoderGuy> sure and what's that do?
[00:35:36] <jonp> it fires up the C# compiler at runtime to interpret expressions / member resolution.
[00:35:42] <ki9a> sort of
[00:35:45] <CoderGuy> ohhhhhhhh
[00:35:49] <CoderGuy> wait that kinda answers it
[00:35:57] <ki9a> it has a partial copy of the overload / type resolving logic
[00:35:57] <jonp> slash "it's complicated"
[00:36:00] <CoderGuy> so it's like coding while running
[00:36:01] <ki9a> it's not the full compiler
[00:36:11] <ki9a> also failing while running
[00:36:25] <CoderGuy> I think I get it when explained this way
[00:37:16] <CoderGuy> so it'd be like taking what exists, copying it over & then writing it out again but just for that step
[00:37:47] <CoderGuy> soooo
[00:38:21] <ki9a> look at it like that

[00:39:53] <CoderGuy> I mean that does make sense why it would work if it analyzes it rewrites the code & then creates the objects needed
[00:40:07] <CoderGuy> or in any event analyzes it & creates the objects needed & then assigns your existing variable to do the new stuff
[00:40:11] <ki9a> if a is dynamic, then it calls Dynamic SetIndex(a, 0, new string[])
[00:40:16] <ki9a> or someting along those lines
[00:40:31] <ki9a> what ends up happening greatly depends on what's in a
[00:40:33] <ki9a> at runtime.
[00:40:41] <CoderGuy> yeah I think I get it
[00:40:58] <CoderGuy> because if you recreate everything then fine but I wonder how it creates the number of [][][]
[00:41:17] <CoderGuy> but maybe it does what that does behind the scenes
[00:41:25] <CoderGuy> here lets check what that does via umm that one place
[00:41:42] <ki9a> the end result is always as if it was typed
[00:41:53] <ki9a> the only difference is the timing, it's checked at runtime
[00:41:58] <CoderGuy> sharplab here
[00:42:16] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Okay those skips are quite clean since it does it on cuts
[00:42:19] <Nasp> I thought it didnt work
[00:46:03] <Suchiman> Nasp: you also gotta configure what kind of things you wanna skip, reminders (like subscribe), outros, intros, etc.
[00:46:06] <CoderGuy> yeah so looking at sharplab kinda helped to see
[00:47:36] <ki9a> i dunno about that
[00:47:39] <CoderGuy> i'm not sure exactly what's happening but I guess it takes the dynamic variable, analyzes everything then figures out how to create a new one & add to it based on the new structure
[00:47:47] <ki9a> the code generated for dynamic is huge and scary
[00:48:00] <CoderGuy> yeah but I see how this could work if you analyze eveyrthing
[00:48:50] <CoderGuy> like even if it was something crazy like
[00:49:06] <CoderGuy> wait idk the command for checking how many [][] there are

[01:00:36] <jonp> not sure i understand that question; what's the actual C# line involved?
[01:04:13] <CoderGuy> i'm wondering how you get the number of dimensions in a multidimensional array IE
[01:04:28] <CoderGuy> a[][] would be 2, a[][][] would be 3, a[][][][] would be 4
[01:04:44] <CoderGuy> and a[] would be 1
[01:05:05] <bomb> you got arbitrary number of nested arrays?
[01:05:49] <CoderGuy> kinda but i'm more just trying to understand given at runtime you had a 2d array or a 3d array etc how would you then take this & dynamically recreate it, like how does it achieve this?
[01:06:12] <jonp> CoderGuy: try the Array.Rank property
[01:06:16] <CoderGuy> I did
[01:06:19] <CoderGuy> it kept giving me 1
[01:06:37] <jonp> actually…that's right
[01:06:57] <jonp> int[][][] is a rank=1 array of int[][], which is a rank=1 array of int[], which is a rank=1 array of int
[01:07:11] <CoderGuy> yeah so like
[01:07:18] <CoderGuy> how to know the dimension count, how does it know XD
[01:07:21] <jonp> so what you'd actually need is .GetType().GetElementType();
[01:07:25] <jonp> recursivelly
[01:07:35] <CoderGuy> oh
[01:07:38] <CoderGuy> okay lets do for one just to see
[01:07:57] <CoderGuy> even that is enough
[01:07:58] <jonp> alongside Type.IsArray
[01:08:09] <CoderGuy> get type gives me System.Int32[][][]
[01:08:15] <CoderGuy> so that's enough on it's own
[01:08:48] <CoderGuy> okay makes sense, so they utilize get type and get element type for reflection as stated previously but now I see how
[01:09:12] <Nasp> Suchiman:  EVERTHING!
[01:09:37] <CoderGuy> alright thx jonp all has been answered for now atleast :D
[01:10:00] <CoderGuy> even given this info I could code something to do it at runtime
[01:10:17] <CoderGuy> but it'd probably be worse then whatever dynamic does
[01:11:15] <CoderGuy> anyways the knowledge is helpful to understand A why not to do this, but B if you had to do it, what you could do in order to achieve it, that GetType thing is very useful

[01:31:02] <CoderGuy> MakeArrayType

[01:40:39] <CoderGuy> so basically in order to achieve this, first they call GetType() to figure out what it is, then turn it into an Array via MakeArrayType() and finally create the array based on the known type that it is, and you can continuously loop to make an array type out of everything, but this is just dynamic so

[04:41:42] <brianonymous_> im not sure, but you saying what you did made me remember i saw a count in the magic code looker dialog thing
[04:45:15] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: actually this should work: "(<?key>[^=]+)=\"(<?value>[^"]+)\""
[04:45:37] <brianonymous_> nope, too late. i hate regex
[04:45:48] <brianonymous_> i was attempting to be lazy
[04:45:53] <JakeSays> regex's are cool
[04:45:56] <brianonymous_> they are
[04:45:58] <JakeSays> extremely handy
[04:46:18] <brianonymous_> this was a path that wasnt hot enough where i would have minded it
[04:46:59] <brianonymous_> but "2" forfils both my needs to not type a lot and not using regex
[04:48:09] <JakeSays> lol the count version has been around since 1.1

[04:54:08] <Nasp> Am i the only one who feels like people go for regex first when wanting to parse something
[04:54:38] <brianonymous_> Nasp: most of my parse cases in the text world are usually solvable with raw dog splits and indexofs
[04:55:01] <brianonymous_> then apple had to go make that hard and quote shit on me
[04:55:24] <brianonymous_> but then MS was like, here, take this 2 and go boldly forward
[04:55:30] <JakeSays> unless perf is an issue i'll use a regex first because they're often cleaner than a string   of splits/indexof's
[04:55:45] <bpmedley> JakeSays : Makes sense, thanks..

[04:57:08] <JakeSays> lol
[04:57:41] <JakeSays> it'd be nice if re2c would generate c++
[04:57:41] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I would say taht depends on the case
[04:57:53] <Nasp> But atleast have a static regex and make it compiled
[04:57:56] <Nasp> Because why not
[04:58:03] <JakeSays> of course
[04:59:28] <Nasp> I also was was it .NET 6 or 7 have compiled regex as in at compile time
[04:59:43] <brianonymous_> i feel like i heard some rumor where net6 or 7 amped up regex performance
[04:59:51] <brianonymous_> jynx
[05:00:17] <JakeSays> Nasp: you mean something like a regex literal?
[05:00:19] <brianonymous_> we must watch the same youtube videos
[05:00:38] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Like private static Regex = new Regex();
[05:01:19] <JakeSays> huh. not sure i like that
[05:01:31] <Nasp> Wel you have to mark it with some source generator label
[05:01:39] <Nasp> I just can't quite find where i saw that
[05:01:42] <JakeSays> ah it's one of those things
[05:01:48] <Nasp> yeah not by default
[05:02:05] <Nasp> [RegexSourceGenerator
[05:02:09] <Nasp> And then it needsd to be partial
[05:02:14] <Nasp> Although not sure if i made it into .NET 6
[05:02:18] <JakeSays> Nasp: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3654154/microsoft-revs-up-regex-source-generation-in-net-7.html ?
[05:02:26] <Nasp> Also i'm still not sure if it's worth it with all this ahead of time
[05:02:31] <Nasp> It's not like i favor slower compiles
[05:02:38] <Nasp> Unless it can be changed depending on debug/release
[05:02:51] <Nasp> Yes it was probably when i  read .NET 7 preview release notes
[05:03:16] <JakeSays> it might be necessary for AOT to get perf out of regexes
[05:03:30] <JakeSays> since in an AOT scenario the regexes would be interpreted
[05:03:36] <Nasp> Yup
[05:04:15] <Nasp> I kinda want to benchmark if it makes a different in request per second with compiled or using spans
[05:04:26] <Nasp> I feel like some stuff is too simple for a Regex
[05:04:44] <Nasp> Checking if something is alphanumeric, do we need a regex for that?
[05:04:46] <brianonymous_> i wonder if AOT boosts roslyn startup times
[05:04:59] <Nasp> "2021-01" datetime format, why regex it
[05:05:31] <JakeSays> Nasp: because you get validation as well as parsing. it's also cleaner than the alternative
[05:05:33] <brianonymous_> one of my services compiles a bunch of scripts, and that first one can take 3+ seconds just to get the compiler in gear
[05:05:33] <Nasp> "private static readonly Regex DigitRegex = new Regex("^[0-9]+$", RegexOptions.Compiled);"
[05:05:40] <Nasp> Checks if something is a number and then uses it as a number
[05:05:46] <Nasp> Wouldn't int.TryParse be better :D
[05:06:25] <JakeSays> doesn't tryparse strip whitespace?
[05:06:30] <Nasp> Sure
[05:06:38] <Nasp> But then you know it's a valid number and can just use the original string
[05:06:41] <JakeSays> then it's not equiv.
[05:07:05] <Nasp> Just TryParse(input, out discord)
[05:07:07] <Nasp> discard
[05:07:08] <Nasp> Damn it
[05:07:13] <JakeSays> the regex might also be faster
[05:07:19] <JakeSays> if all you want is validation
[05:07:36] <brianonymous_> id need to see numbers for that
[05:07:49] <brianonymous_> would be impressed if true
[05:07:58] <JakeSays> i vaguely recall tryparse involving lots of culture shit
[05:08:10] <JakeSays> maybe that was float.tryparse
[05:08:59] <brianonymous_> my regex pain is from oldschool experience there.. i should probably double check if the modern experience is dif
[05:09:08] <brianonymous_> and if so, how much
[05:09:58] <JakeSays> lemme bench it
[05:11:12] <brianonymous_> like, i wouldnt mind trading lines of code for a single liner with more visual complexity if performce is equal or better
[05:12:07] <Nasp> But i wonder if it really matters changing a regex to something faster overall
[05:12:15] <brianonymous_> why dont you bench the kvsplit with 2 and the regex version too, id love to know
[05:12:19] <Nasp> Like in micro benchmarks my other approaches are like 500x faster
[05:12:25] <Nasp> But not sure if it changes anything in the overall
[05:12:39] <brianonymous_> nasp: yeah, i mainly mean in hot loops..
[05:12:53] <Nasp> Well 2-4 per request is that kinda a hot loop?
[05:13:51] <Nasp> I could try and benchmark that DigitRegex vs TryParse
[05:14:06] <brianonymous_> that starts relying on requests per sec
[05:14:17] <brianonymous_> same story tho, yeah
[05:14:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: i'm doing that now
[05:14:27] <Nasp> I also like that we have a regex here that used to check if it's `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`
[05:14:38] <Nasp> And if true, then it's parsed with DateTime.Parse
[05:14:43] <brianonymous_> did a web guy do it?
[05:15:36] <Nasp> "static readonly Regex LineEnding = new Regex(@"(\r\n|\r|\n)");"
[05:15:39] <Nasp> It's used in a replace
[05:15:41] <Nasp> haha
[05:16:01] <brianonymous_> that has an order of web development in it
[05:16:25] <brianonymous_> odor
[05:16:48] <brianonymous_> ive seen some gnarly ones over on that side of the fence
[05:17:14] <JakeSays> 4 million regex: 00:00:00.155883 IntParse: 00:00:00.0503712
[05:17:19] <JakeSays> so def. not faster
[05:17:42] <Nasp> That doesn't look like benchmark dotnet
[05:17:49] <JakeSays> it's not
[05:17:50] <brianonymous_> oo, oo now do var kvSplit = kv.Split('=', 2, StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries);
[05:17:56] <brianonymous_> i bet its way worse
[05:18:00] <Nasp> So INtParse wins?
[05:18:00] <JakeSays> it's just code
[05:18:15] <JakeSays> Nasp: yeah by 3x
[05:18:19] <Nasp> :D
[05:18:23] <brianonymous_>  "(<?key>[^=]+)=\"(<?value>[^"]+)\""
[05:18:25] <Nasp> Take your regex and show it...
[05:18:28] <Nasp> shove, damn it

[07:27:06] <CoderGuy> Logically speaking is there ever a time when a variable could be unknown until runtime? Or are all variables technically known about ahead of time? Like even in the case of <t> when calling said function the type is declared right?
[07:28:00] <CoderGuy> user input aside of course
[07:28:40] <CoderGuy> so no user input when it comes to choice in variables, technically speaking are all types known ahead of time? or is there a situation where dynamic is definately required?
[07:30:26] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: by default all variables have a default value
[07:31:11] <CoderGuy> right so even if you did like var a = "ok"; you really just created a string and should know you created a string thus declare it as a string
[07:31:33] <JakeSays> huh?
[07:31:56] <CoderGuy> i'm trying to figure out if there ever would be a case when you couldn't know what variable type you're using until runtime
[07:31:57] <JakeSays> what you created is a variable with a string constant assigned to it
[07:32:31] <JakeSays> c# is static/strong typed so no there isn't
[07:32:40] <JakeSays> unless you actually create a type at runtime
[07:33:15] <CoderGuy> right
[07:33:19] <CoderGuy> so we not doing that
[07:33:56] <CoderGuy> but I was just trying to see because I have Array myarray; but then I want it to be string[], and other then doing (string[])myarray; it seemed hard to achieve this
[07:34:25] <CoderGuy> like I wanted to somehow base it on another variable, but I guess even basing it on another variable is illogical because you should always know the type ahead of time?
[07:36:28] <CoderGuy> like even if I have var myarray = resultfromfunction();   I should know that I assigned myarray to the type returned from resultfromfunction, thus if I want something else to be the same type I should cast it accordingly, IE if I want it string[] I should cast as (string[]) not based on the resulting var?
[07:37:13] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: why are you using Array?
[07:37:20] <CoderGuy> it's not on purpose i'm just experimenting
[07:37:23] <JakeSays> ah
[07:37:31] <CoderGuy> and one of the multidimensional array functions used that
[07:37:40] <CoderGuy> the one that creates layers based on array input
[07:38:18] <CoderGuy> so obviously I can change the function to return what I want
[07:38:27] <CoderGuy> but that begs the question, should I always know the type that I want?
[07:39:23] <CoderGuy> I think the answer is yes but then we have dynamic so I guess sometimes no
[07:41:40] <JakeSays> yes you should
[07:42:21] <JakeSays> dynamic was added to make COM interop somewhat sane and to support building dynamic languages
[07:44:14] <CoderGuy> ic ic
[07:44:22] <CoderGuy> alright well with that thought process this seems to work easily
[07:44:40] <CoderGuy> instead of returning array I returned (T)thevar;
[07:44:45] <CoderGuy> or rather
[07:44:51] <CoderGuy> (T[])thevar; since it's an array
[07:45:11] <CoderGuy> oh even that's wrong though because it's supposed to support multidimensions
[07:45:13] <CoderGuy> I imagine that ruins it
[07:45:19] <CoderGuy> so yeah you have to cast after the function goes off
[07:45:30] <CoderGuy> or maybe not hold on
[07:48:06] <CoderGuy> yeah you have to cast after, it fails trying to implement based on the T but only because of not assigning prior
[07:49:10] <CoderGuy> but in that case like maybe this is pointless because of not knowing the type ahead of time
[07:49:51] <CoderGuy> the function figures out whether to make an array or a[][] or a[][][]
[07:50:12] <JakeSays> that seems like a bad design
[07:50:36] <CoderGuy> but what if you only know the depth of the array after some loop calculation?
[07:51:30] <CoderGuy> like what if you have a bunch of data to be sifted through resulting in some complicated array based on the sort
[07:51:38] <CoderGuy> for example json
[07:52:39] <JakeSays> i would probably split in to two methods: one that determines the array arity and one that fills it
[07:53:04] *** Joins: Hanii (~textual@2a00:23c5:c583:a300:703e:83c:4ed1:bc6)
[07:53:34] <brianonymous_> i think im the only person here that has gotten channel approval for my use case of dynamic
[07:53:38] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: well, you should know the shape of the json data before parsing it
[07:53:52] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: you did not. i have yet to approve, dammit
[07:54:04] <brianonymous_> you conceded
[07:54:11] <teegee> what's your use case?
[07:54:16] <JakeSays> did not!
[07:54:18] <JakeSays> never!
[07:54:30] <JakeSays> and yeah, what's the use case
[07:54:36] <teegee> lol
[07:54:45] <brianonymous_> i have runtime compiled csx scripts that need configuration data on init that comes in from an API and can be of any shape
[07:55:01] <CoderGuy> brianonymous_, what'd you do to solve this conundrum?
[07:55:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: yeah i wouldn't have approved of that
[07:55:25] <teegee> just do it in python
[07:55:26] <brianonymous_> squashed the config data into a dynamic field
[07:55:37] <CoderGuy> teegee isn't that just saying "make it dynamic" ?
[07:55:43] <teegee> :>
[07:55:50] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: nothing can be of any shape and be useful
[07:55:53] <CoderGuy> ic, so I take it whenever this problem really arises, the answer is dynamic
[07:56:14] <teegee> I mean, there is json
[07:56:15] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: no
[07:56:27] <CoderGuy> does json work off dynamic?
[07:56:38] <brianonymous_> it can yes
[07:56:43] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: there are json parsers/writers that use dynamic
[07:57:04] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: i seriously conceded?
[07:57:06] <CoderGuy> are there ones that don't? like is this a solveable problem when the data can be of any shape after parsing the string?
[07:57:13] <JakeSays> or are you fake newsing me
[07:57:16] <brianonymous_> JakeSays: well, at least you understood the pain i was in
[07:57:20] <JakeSays> ah
[07:57:53] <JakeSays> yes, i can empathize and still smack you with a disapproval stick
[07:58:14] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: what do you use for a .csx editor?///////
[07:58:18] <JakeSays> fucking kbd
[07:58:19] <brianonymous_> i mean, i wasnt a huge fan of doing it, but it made it much easier for my script writers (read: support/implementations) folks to work
[07:58:31] <brianonymous_> i wrote my own script editor
[07:58:40] <CoderGuy> I guess  you could have like a limit on how deep the data can go before switching to dynamic?
[07:58:54] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: with syntax highlighting and intellisense?
[07:58:55] <brianonymous_> its pretty rad, it can emulate the full system
[07:58:59] <brianonymous_> yeah, wanna see
[07:59:05] <JakeSays> yes i do
[07:59:08] <CoderGuy> or you could make a really big file
[07:59:26] <CoderGuy> you could even have like 5 or 6 different variable types to handle all the cases
[07:59:43] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: that would be a cluster fuck
[07:59:55] <brianonymous_> http://98.117.195.56:88/ims.png .. it even has a built in "unit test" system
[08:00:11] <CoderGuy> well again Jake I mean the problem is simple which one to use a[] or a[][] or a[][][] or a[][][][] as you can see this bubbles up
[08:00:29] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: cool. what did you use for the editor?
[08:00:44] <CoderGuy> and the result changes based on the data input, soooo
[08:00:45] <brianonymous_> uhhh it was an A word i think
[08:00:50] <JakeSays> avalon
[08:00:52] <brianonymous_> yeah!
[08:01:05] <JakeSays> yeah that's an excellent editor
[08:01:21] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: what do you use for intellisense
[08:01:28] <brianonymous_> i didnt
[08:01:33] <brianonymous_> msdn
[08:01:40] <JakeSays> what??
[08:01:54] <JakeSays> you need to integrate omnisharp
[08:01:57] <brianonymous_> i had to make this thing fast, to help out my guys
[08:02:02] <JakeSays> well, my version of omnisharp
[08:02:04] <brianonymous_> they were using notepad++
[08:02:17] <brianonymous_> but i wanted them to be able to test with real world data while they wrote
[08:02:30] <JakeSays> that's very cool
[08:02:42] <CoderGuy> okay my new solution is this I think it's a good answer we'll see if Jake approves
[08:03:21] <CoderGuy> Figure out your data structure beforehand, if you can't figure out your data structure before hand, at the very least figure out the most common resulting data & finally if you truly can't do it, then just switch to dynamic
[08:03:57] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: that makes no sense. why wouldn't you know the structure beforehand?
[08:04:21] <CoderGuy> as we said earlier, sometimes you have data that is input which results in the data structure after performing a parse
[08:04:24] <brianonymous_> CoderGuy: what exactly are you doing, i think i missed that part
[08:04:40] <CoderGuy> brianonymous_, just experimenting with data, also working on ways to parse some css
[08:04:42] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: the parser knows the shape of everything it's going to parse
[08:05:35] <CoderGuy> JakeSays, if that's true why is Json dynamically typed?
[08:05:48] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: json isn't dynamically typed
[08:05:57] <CoderGuy> okay so how do they do it without the dynamic?
[08:06:03] <JakeSays> everything in a json construct has a type
[08:06:43] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: you should be parsing json data in to a concrete type
[08:07:14] <brianonymous_> and then think about trees
[08:07:16] <JakeSays> if your json is truly arbitrary, then you use a JObject
[08:07:26] <brianonymous_> parent/child stuff
[08:07:47] <JakeSays> but there are very very few situations where one would be parsing arbitrary json
[08:07:53] <CoderGuy> sure but you end up with stuff like { videos=["a.mp4"],id="123",usernames=["bob",["boo","jen"]] }
[08:08:19] <brianonymous_> by using json.bnet
[08:08:21] <brianonymous_> -b.
[08:08:32] <CoderGuy> right but how did they achieve this?
[08:08:38] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: well, you would parse that in to a type that matches the shape of the json
[08:09:01] <JakeSays> if the json doesn't match a type the parser expects, then the parse should fail
[08:09:09] <CoderGuy> ohhhh
[08:09:12] <CoderGuy> ic what you mean
[08:09:24] <brianonymous_> the array example is not disimilar from doing () parsings
[08:09:58] <CoderGuy> but what if all I want is to be able to convert my string into json such that some crazy structure could exist
[08:09:59] <JakeSays> there truly is no such thing as untyped data.
[08:10:00] <brianonymous_> tho you can still walkin linear and build a tree
[08:10:22] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: not sure what that means
[08:10:40] <CoderGuy> well maybe I just want to sort the string data so I can look at it
[08:11:00] <JakeSays> how do you know it's string data
[08:11:03] <CoderGuy> oh instead of it being a single type you have multiple
[08:11:10] <brianonymous_> it is multiple types
[08:11:30] <CoderGuy> ic so build a data type that can have multiple types
[08:11:33] <CoderGuy> and then build that structure
[08:11:35] <brianonymous_> infact, its a direct corrolation to trees/parents/childrens of objects by its name
[08:11:50] <CoderGuy> brianonymous_, so json is just a tree then?
[08:12:06] <JakeSays> it can be
[08:12:18] <CoderGuy> ic so you really do mean it when you say parse it the way it should be parsed
[08:12:26] <JakeSays> well, i suppose you could say it always is, just a very small tree
[08:12:33] <CoderGuy> rather than how i'm used to seeing it which is in dynamic languages like javascript
[08:12:34] <brianonymous_> a trunk?
[08:12:45] <teegee> is there a threadsafe way of: if (foo != null) await foo.DoStuffAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
[08:12:47] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: yes, i really do mean it
[08:12:53] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: lol yup
[08:13:15] <CoderGuy> okay that makes sense, i'm very used to using primitive types but considering you really had all that extra stuff hmmm
[08:13:25] <CoderGuy> lemme look at how c# handles json I bet we see something here
[08:13:46] <JakeSays> CoderGuy: c# doesn't handle json in any way. you use a json library
[08:13:58] <brianonymous_> teegee: i think i do something similar with a block cache downloder thing, lemme go look
[08:14:09] <CoderGuy> sure but like how that library generally handles it will probably answer this

[08:20:07] <brianonymous_> whats a good paster these days
[08:20:15] <CoderGuy> okay I see now
[08:21:02] <SAMSUNG> I just got an offer to do a Masters degree at Sydney University, should I quit my job and do the Masters or keep doing my job?
[08:21:07] <CoderGuy> so json will take the data, read it and apply it to the data structure of the class/object and then when you print said objects data, it just goes over the data of the object to print it or I guess "serialize" if you will
[08:21:16] <SAMSUNG> what if I do the masters then find out I can't get a job
[08:21:18] <SAMSUNG> it's a bit risky
[08:21:39] <SAMSUNG> I'm a programmer alread
[08:21:41] <SAMSUNG> already
[08:21:48] <CoderGuy> so rather than try to create some chaotic dynamically typed array, apply the data to the object properly
[08:22:00] <teegee> are you in sydney?
[08:22:28] <brianonymous_> teegee: https://pastecode.io/s/vuedo1ve
[08:22:41] <CoderGuy> as brianonymous_ was pointing out, you can apply it via a tree or just apply it via the class objects structure, but when printing it you go over it to print it
[08:23:08] <CoderGuy> JakeSays, okay I learned, cool stuff :D
[08:23:22] <CoderGuy> I see now also why my questions seemed off, I didn't realize there were other ways of storing data
[08:24:01] <CoderGuy> Also I think this problem can happen because whenever I look at data it's in it's printed form, so it didn't occure to me that it could be stored completely different from how it's printed
[08:24:55] <brianonymous_> teegee: suchi reminded me of the trick that you can plop a task into a var and await it later. i always forget

[09:11:29] <SAMSUNG> well, I had to use .NET Framework to convert RTF to TXT
[09:11:35] <teegee> exactly, get a job in something you like and do that
[09:11:59] <SAMSUNG> the old .NET is closed source
[09:12:09] <teegee> and then, 10 years later, when you're an expert you can hate yourself for going that way 10 years ago when all the job ads you see are for "the other thing"
[09:12:35] <ravindUwU> referencesource.microsoft.com is supposed to be the .NET framework source code though, isn't it?
[09:13:20] <SAMSUNG> I mean
[09:13:26] <SAMSUNG> windows is the most common OS
[09:13:34] <SAMSUNG> wouldn't it make sense to learn what is common
[09:13:37] <SAMSUNG> ?
[09:14:06] <teegee> you can do python and go on windows
[09:14:33] <teegee> but, you know, if I were you, I'd go into mobile. Definitely
[09:14:41] <SAMSUNG> yes

[09:14:54] <SAMSUNG> everyone uses apps

[09:15:23] <SAMSUNG> all their websites are served via apps
[09:15:26] <SAMSUNG> like tik tok
[09:15:29] <JakeSays> ravindUwU: most of it, but not the runtime
[09:16:01] <JakeSays> SAMSUNG: there are open source libraries for reading RTF
[09:16:12] <SAMSUNG> I just used a rich text box
[09:16:17] <SAMSUNG> and then copied the text
[09:16:23] <SAMSUNG> from the control
[09:16:41] <JakeSays> well, that's one way i suppose
[09:17:24] <SAMSUNG> I haven't done much coding, most of what I've been doing this past 2 weeks is database administration for elasticsearch
[09:17:30] <SAMSUNG> even tho ES isn't a database
[09:17:33] <SAMSUNG> it's a document store
[09:17:39] <ravindUwU> ravindUwU, ohhh _that_ makes sense; thanks ^^
[09:17:49] <ravindUwU> JakeSays, ohhh _that_ makes sense; thanks ^^
[09:17:51] <SAMSUNG> ES is also open source

[11:51:40] <maroon> just a followup for Suchiman, about not getting the expected 280% speed for openssl over the rust .dll's performance. i forget the rust dll was doing 2 fermat tests against p and q, so dividing the rust.dll's effect in half vs openssl against only p, was 140% speed, which is close to what i'm getting when i substitute openssl for rust in the program

[15:49:37] <Andrio> Does Unity itself have an 'allow unsafe code' build option?
[15:50:12] <Assault> Andrio, in assembly definitons there is an option to allow unsafe code. And it works, as I have other asm def in the same project that work
[15:50:45] <Assault> But I just saw a better error message about the problem in the unity console: "Unsafe code may not appear in iterators
[15:50:45] <Assault> "
[15:51:04] <Assault> and the method I try to use it in returns an IEnumerator...
[15:54:10] <Assault> so I guess the solution is to just move resolving the IntPtr that I need to separate helper method that returns IntPtr

[17:29:04] <bpmedley> alguien : Xamarin Forms is disappointing.  I'm hoping MAUI will be better.
[17:29:20] <alguien> i guess
[17:29:43] <alguien> bpmedley, I'm skeptical. It'll be better sure, but will it be different enough?
[17:29:52] <bpmedley> I should be more specific, I wager.  I'm excited about the cross-platform nature of MAUI.
[17:30:26] <MatthiasVance> I probably won't touch it any time soon .. but what I am excited about is that they centralized the image/asset management across platforms
[17:30:29] <MatthiasVance> That was a pain to deal with
[17:30:50] <MatthiasVance> Also, AQMP is bullshit
[17:30:50] <bpmedley> alguien : I'm taking a wait and see approach.  If there is another miss-step on the client, then I'm not sure what I'm going to do for desktop apps.  Maybe rust.
[17:31:32] <alguien> I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to more sense to write native or... MAUI without the UI(?) apps for Windows and macOS like it makes more sense to use Xamarin without the Forms for Android and iOS apps

[17:34:10] <bpmedley> I may go for a web based desktop app, but I plan on waiting a bit for MAUI and seeing if it works well.
[17:35:53] <bomb> that's too much trust on Microsoft
[17:36:16] <bomb> before MAUI, Flutter is going to be stable on Linux and macOS
[17:36:38] <bomb> it already is on Windows, but Win10+ only
[17:36:58] <bpmedley> bomb : Flutter sounds nice, but I want the .Net library ecosystem..
[17:37:24] <bomb> is CEF still a thing?
[17:39:59] <bpmedley> Dunno.  There is also a MAUI webview for things like Blazor, but then again, that assumes MAUI works well.
[17:40:25] <jmer> web based desktop apps is just a huge ressource drain!

[18:06:52] <Suchiman> jmer: you mean something like service bus?
[18:08:02] <jmer> Suchiman: maybe. From my understanding of service busses you have to modify your services to actively use them.
[18:08:16] <jmer> i.e. using Rebus
[18:08:22] <jmer> (or similar)
[18:08:29] <Suchiman> jmer: yes, what is your goal here?
[18:08:45] <jmer> Suchiman: not using API Management gateway for internal service to service calls.
[18:09:13] <jmer> It's entirely possible to do so, but it's not designed for this purpose and we have loads of on premise hosted services... If they all have to go by Azure's API management it won't be nice for latency

[18:54:39] <MatthiasVance> ORMs are bad?
[18:55:06] <MatthiasVance> I am always on the side of "whatever makes my life easier and makes migration painless"
[18:55:15] <MatthiasVance> But other people are like "whyyyy another DSL on top of SQL!!!!"
[18:55:22] <MatthiasVance> And "You don't know what it doeeees"
[18:56:34] <jmer> MatthiasVance: As long as the ORM isn't a crutch for lazy devs not wanting to learn SQL I have nothing against them
[18:56:58] <MatthiasVance> If you wouldn't use an ORM, what would you use for DB migrations?
[18:57:28] <MatthiasVance> Ah hm there is of course DbUp
[18:57:32] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I recently implemented FluentMigrator on one of our projects because a dev had used EF; but not consistently so the EF migrations broke
[18:57:44] <MatthiasVance> Ah yeah FluentMigrator is also nice
[18:57:55] <bpmedley> I like DbUp
[18:58:05] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I like that you can do most things with fluent interface, but it still lets you resort to SQL if you need something that the Fluent interface doesn't support
[18:58:31] <jmer> I didn't like DbUp because it was script based.
[18:58:54] <jmer> I compared DbUp, FluentMigrator and Simple.Migrations and FluentMigrator won out (just be reading docs/examples) but ofc. YMMV
[18:59:53] <bpmedley> Just looked at the FluentMigrator landing page and it looks neat

[19:11:29] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I spent two days trying but none of the solutions I found actually worked
[19:11:29] <MatthiasVance> So you've answered your own question now? :D
[19:11:41] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Oh, how come? :o You can just regenerate from the DB right
[19:11:55] <MatthiasVance> Well, not everything ...
[19:12:02] <jmer> MatthiasVance: it used Code first approach and it was the only project out of all solutions that used EF
[19:12:06] <jmer> everything else uses Dapper
[19:12:08] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[19:12:46] <jmer> That dev who did it isn't here anymore we basically had to roll back the entire project to before he did his "refactoring" because it was 10 times slower and 25 times more complex
[19:12:53] <jmer> he had used all kinds of fancy patterns
[19:13:07] <jmer> but this was basically about pulling data from a DB and outputting it as json...
[19:13:21] <jmer> I have no clue hwo one thinks it's a good idea to add so much extra complexity for such a simple task

[19:40:33] <jmer> MatthiasVance: what do you mean that an ORM gives the ability to filter by tenant id?
[19:40:41] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Oh with the query filters
[19:40:48] <MatthiasVance> It applies to all queries around a certain entity
[19:41:14] <jmer> oh... I don't have a lot of knowledge about EF
[19:41:22] <MatthiasVance> So you can do Entity<SomeModel>().AddQueryFilter(x => x.TenantId = _context.TenantId)
[19:41:25] <jmer> Most places I've seen it used, it's been used incorrectly, creating more issues than it solves.
[19:41:34] <MatthiasVance> And then every query on SomeModel always filters that based on context

[21:04:51] <bomb> how does that make him less safe?
[21:05:12] <lz_> ppl might not want to wait and see what he wants to do with his sword and take him out first

[21:39:00] <lz_> makes me wonder how much "google suggest" actually fueled this kind of behavior
[21:39:08] <irwiss> yeah the problem is that now you got the internet where no matter how dumb of an idea you have there's likely to be another idiot just like you who has the same idea
[21:39:48] <irwiss> so you always have circlejerks for the dumbest things, and it's very hard to get out of those since the experience of being 'in' is positive and feels nice

[22:18:18] <Fiji> question for you guys: i recently got an offer from a company that states any work i do off hours/off company resources is still owned by the company while employed by them. i dont contribute to a ton of OSS stuff but i do especially if i find a bug or something that i can fix. would open source maintainers accept contributions if i am under such a clause in the contract?
[22:18:41] <Fiji> keep in mind this is in the US so people like to sue anytime for anything lol
[22:18:49] <jonp> Fiji: ask your imployer
[22:18:50] <brianonymous_> the purpose for that is usually so they get first dibs at potential new IP
[22:19:12] <Fiji> jonp, i did, they said "oh it is fine to contribute" but wont let me know who owns the copyright on the contribution
[22:19:49] <Fiji> yeah i understand that brianonymous_, but the definition in the contract is "anything related to software", its excessively broad in my view
[22:20:41] <lz_> Fiji: what kind of stuff is this company doing? just so I know not to apply
[22:20:54] <Fiji> lz_, NLP :)
[22:21:22] <jonp> Fiji: your employer claims to own the copyright
[22:21:47] <lz_> Fiji: as in natural language processing ?
[22:22:26] <lz_> not sure about your country but my guess is such clause would probably be illegal in mine and not enforcable anyway
[22:22:39] *** Quits: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo) (Quit: The Game)
[22:22:46] <Fiji> right, but lets say i contribute to a project that is GPL or something similar, i believe the license claims any contribution to the project must assign copyright to the project itself jonp, in that case, who really owns it? maybe because my employer owns it, they would reject such a contribution from the project?
[22:22:53] <Fiji> lz_, yeah natural language processing
[22:23:15] <Fiji> lz_, yeah i mean its unenforceable in certain places but not in mine :X, that being said, i don't want to be the guinea pig to test it out
[22:23:29] <MatthiasVance> Fiji: I think the MS repos have a check where you have to say you can "give the code away"
[22:23:46] <jonp> Fiji: if the project requires copyright assignment, then you'll need to chat w/ your employer about assigning copyright
[22:23:47] <MatthiasVance> But yeah ask your employer and get things in writing
[22:23:52] <jonp> Fiji: but many projects do NOT require copyright assignment
[22:23:56] <jonp> Linux doesn't, for instance.
[22:24:10] <Fiji> jonp, ok, i understand, i wish they would just strike the clause from the contract though :/
[22:24:18] <MatthiasVance> Fiji: Make them do that!
[22:24:23] <Fiji> i am trying they won't budge
[22:24:28] <Fiji> probably will have to pass on the offer lol
[22:24:45] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I don't like that clause at all
[22:24:52] <Fiji> its just i have never before nor have any friends who have such a clause
[22:24:52] <MatthiasVance> I now have an explicit "allowed" in there :D
[22:25:01] <Fiji> in their existing contracts
[22:25:04] <Fiji> good
[22:25:34] <MatthiasVance> I am in EU though, not US

[22:26:40] <MatthiasVance> No thank you

[22:29:08] <MatthiasVance> Instead of trying to tell them, tell them

[22:30:28] <jonp> see §4 clauses (a)…(d)
[22:30:32] <brianonymous_> if its not related to my day job, id have to clear it with management, and was told for non-related fields, they would not care
[22:30:50] <Nasp> brianonymous_: So i think we will start paying from 1. april
[22:30:51] <MatthiasVance> jonp: "Lasl revised 3/1/98" , is that still current? :D
[22:30:54] <Nasp> For Datadog
[22:30:59] <Fiji> yeah jonp see section 4 sounds reasonable to me lol
[22:31:02] <jonp> MatthiasVance: i'd have to dig out my current contract ;-)
[22:31:11] <MatthiasVance> jonp: Ah no worries was just wondering :D
[22:31:17] <Nasp> I just tried to do some basic calculations, we'll pay 2500 euro just for a simple api.domain.com/ping :D
[22:31:24] <MatthiasVance> wuuut
[22:31:25] <Fiji> my version of section 4 includes "any thing related to software and completed during employment even off of company time or without using company resources" lol
[22:31:38] <jonp> that sounds excessive
[22:31:49] <Nasp> Fiji:  Here such contracts became illegal
[22:32:09] <Fiji> it's illegal here in some states, but not in others. my state has never tested it, and i do not want to be the first to test it ll
[22:32:11] <Fiji> *lol
[22:32:13] <MatthiasVance> Here you can have non-competes, but they cannot reasonably be enforced
[22:32:33] <jonp> they can be in many US states
[22:32:36] <Nasp> Here non compete is kinda implied, but many used to have "If oyu make anything, even in your spare time, it's ours"
[22:32:43] <jonp> and non-competes are moving "downlevel"
[22:32:48] <jonp> like, to burger flippers
[22:32:50] <jonp> insanity
[22:32:53] <MatthiasVance> Oh wtf
[22:33:00] <Nasp> Have anyone signeda non-compete in case they stop at their current workplace?
[22:33:06] <MatthiasVance> US workforce is screwed anyway =/
[22:33:06] <Fiji> i have never signed a contract that didnt include a non-compete lol
[22:34:13] <Nasp> Is the non compete against any kind of work?
[22:35:07] <Fiji> no just in the same industry usually
[22:35:22] <Fiji> so if i did clinical work cant go into making more doctor software somewhere else etc
[22:35:25] <Nasp> I think mine had any kind of work
[22:35:30] <Nasp> Which also included volunteer work
[22:35:33] <Nasp> Or like the board i'm in

[22:37:21] <Nasp> Althought looks like the content is underneath the popup
[22:37:28] <Nasp> But why would fastfood worrkers signi non compete
[22:37:39] <jonp> 'cause they have little/no choice
[22:37:47] <jonp> and/or don't realize it's even in there
[22:37:49] <Nasp> But dont they have less choice then
[22:38:01] <Fiji> 1 choice is better than 0 choices
[22:38:05] <jonp> my 16yo daughter signed a noncompete for her summer job
[22:38:11] <Fiji> lol... thats sad
[22:38:46] <jonp> which… she's a minor.  it's not like it's that enforceable, and i don't think it matters much
[22:38:54] <jonp> but it's kinda the principal of the thing
[22:39:00] <jonp> they're making EVERYONE sign these damn things
[22:39:03] <Fiji> principle?
[22:39:10] <jonp> whichever
[22:39:29] <Nasp> Also only non compete while working there?
[22:39:36] <Nasp> There's also those non compete after you stop working
[22:39:42] <Nasp> I dont get why people would ever sign those
[22:39:58] <jonp> 'cause there's not necessarily much alternative
[22:41:02] <Fiji> just imagine you live in some small town and the only jobs available to you for your current credentials are mcdonalds and burger king.. no other industry in the town that would offer you work... you gotta pay bills somewhow
[22:41:04] <Fiji> *somehow
[22:43:57] <ki9a> non compete are pretty common in NL
[22:44:18] <ki9a> as in you'll find them in pretty much every job
[22:44:35] <jonp> which just re-raises the question; *why*? and how often are they enforced?

[22:52:47] <ki9a> yeah..
[22:52:54] <ki9a> It's allowed
[22:53:00] <ki9a> everybody does it
[22:53:07] <ki9a> so the real question is probably "why not" for an employer?
[22:55:25] <bomb> jonp is Xamarin for Flutter becoming a thing in the future?
[22:55:47] <ki9a> if it's not officially now
[22:55:51] <ki9a> he's probalby under NDA :)
[22:56:28] <jonp> I've not heard of such a thing.  i don't know everything.
[22:57:11] <ki9a> a zircom one would probably make more sense
[22:57:13] <bomb> ki9a so jonp is telling lies to us right now?
[22:57:22] <ki9a> I doubt he's telling lies
[23:02:10] <bomb> too bad Flutter Web isn't like Blazor
[23:02:12] <bomb> that would be dope
[23:03:50] *** bomb is now known as bomberman
[23:05:26] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Yes but non competes in NL are not enforceable
[23:05:38] <ki9a> are you 100% sure?
[23:05:56] <MatthiasVance> There is plenty of precedent that if you as an employee get to a "better place" they can't do it
[23:06:05] <jonp> in NL?
[23:06:07] <MatthiasVance> Which is usually why you leave
[23:06:08] <MatthiasVance> yes
[23:06:19] <ki9a> ah well there you go
[23:06:21] <MatthiasVance> That was regarding: " <+ki9a> non compete are pretty common in NL"
[23:06:24] <ki9a> that makes them quite useless
[23:06:27] <MatthiasVance> Indeed
[23:06:59] <MatthiasVance> Although this sounds serious: https://business.gov.nl/regulation/non-compete-clause/
[23:07:28] <MatthiasVance> But, important: "Your employee could ask the district court if the non-compete clauses in the contract are truly necessary and legitimate. If you fail to properly substantiate the non-compete clauses, the district court may void the clauses."
[23:08:00] <MatthiasVance> And usually they are way too broad in NL
[23:08:10] <MatthiasVance> Like you can't work for any software company for 2 years.. like wtf
[23:08:32] <MatthiasVance> non-solicitation clause on the other hand is a good one to have
[23:08:39] <MatthiasVance> (maybe)
[23:09:18] <MatthiasVance> "The non-compete clause may not limit your employee unreasonably. The clause must be clear on what is and what is not allowed."

[23:24:45] <brianonymous_> tho, at the same time, i dont think there has ever been a case i actually needed MS support for net
[23:25:03] <jonp> ki9a: i think we're thinking of: https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/09/using-java-11-in-production-important-things-to-know/
[23:25:54] <ki9a> hmm
[23:25:58] <jonp> which basically means "don't use the Oracle build, use someone else's build"
[23:26:03] <ki9a> that yes.
[23:26:05] <jonp> of which there are *many*
[23:26:07] <ki9a> but I did say a bit messy
[23:26:12] <MatthiasVance> Do they still do security releases for .NET 5 after that? Or is "no support" no releases at all?
[23:26:14] <jonp> Microsoft has an OpenJDK-11 build now!
[23:26:27] <jonp> MatthiasVance: "no support" i believe includes "no security updates"
[23:26:35] <jonp> if you want security, update to .NET 6, the LTS release
[23:26:36] <MatthiasVance> Oh very good
[23:26:40] <jonp> and then you'll get updates for 3 years
[23:26:49] <MatthiasVance> Ah yeah, so you should have stayed on 3.1 for now
[23:27:15] <brianonymous_> as long as i dont have to rewrite any controller again, im happy

[23:29:15] <ki9a> don't you still use webforms?
[23:30:06] <bomb> WebForms was a brilliant idea
[23:30:16] <bomb> now many companies selling that as "low-code platform"
[23:31:34] <MatthiasVance> I'm working on an integration platform, but I am not sure if the complexity is worth it :o
[23:31:43] <irwiss> so that's what that song was about heh https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/tlwa78/the_story_behind_michael_jacksons_vocalizations/
[23:32:01] <irwiss> also TIL installing forza horizon on hdd was a baaaad idea...

[23:35:01] <bomb> what is an hdd? oh those steam-powered industrial revolution machine that's supposed to store data
[23:35:26] <jonp> no, it's a magical device that stores data through magic
[23:37:15] <jonp> bomb: https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1463733095144771585 + thread
[23:37:56] <bomb> jonp I was excited for a moment thinking it would be about Xamarin + Flutter :(
[23:38:14] <jonp> SwiftOnSecurity? mention Xamarin? lol
[23:38:50] <irwiss> even a simple audio cd is pretty complex as a physical object
[23:38:51] <bomb> ha. didn't notice :D
[23:39:21] <bomb> is NTFS a compressing filesystem?
[23:39:41] <bomb> oh yeah, that's literally the 4th tweet

[23:41:17] <jonp> NTFS supports compression
[23:41:45] <jonp> but the primary point -- which wasn't on that thread, but elsewhere, and I can't find it -- is that "0" bits and "1" bits don't really exist anymore on modern magnetic media
[23:42:04] <jonp> it's all "guesswork", which is guessed accurately 100% of the time.
[23:42:09] <jonp> fucking magic
[23:42:55] <bomb> "all fonts should be monospaced"
[23:43:00] <brianonymous_> ki9a: lol, i am proud to say I never once used webforms
[23:43:07] <ki9a> :)
[23:50:32] <MatthiasVance> I think I looked at it once and saw the gigantic stuff it added to the DOM
[23:50:44] <MatthiasVance> And ran
[23:50:44] <irwiss> tbh they don't exist in practically any modern electronics above transistor level either, even simple wire protocols use at the very least simple encoding schemes, even simple usb used nrz, something with bandwidth like pci-e uses much more complex encodings to get both bandwidth and ecc into the signal
[23:51:22] <bomb> jonp Xamarin Fuchsia
[23:55:39] <Guest65> MatthiasVance: why? You don't like turning HTTP into a stateful monstrosity by serialising loads of random server state and shunting it back and forth to the client?
[23:56:14] <jonp> lol
