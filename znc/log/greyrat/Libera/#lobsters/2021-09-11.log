[19:08:13] <riv> well my question about the multi-terabyte thing: did just a few kb of a large file change?

[21:54:29] <technomancy> epilys[m]: yeah they exist but A) they don't work because browsers suck and B) why should I need a new keypair when I already have a perfectly good one?

[21:58:39] <imode> be my guest.
[21:58:41] <rhn> riv: why shouldn't it be "good"? it solves some problem I'm sure
[21:58:45] <riv> which problem?
[21:59:01] <imode> geographic distribution and fault tolerance.
[21:59:07] <riv> two of the disadvantages are: having to run multiple servers, having to send messages between servers, netsplits
[21:59:28] <imode> you don't have to run multiple servers.

[21:59:57] <rhn> technomancy: I'll go for "why should I need a static keypair"
[22:00:07] <imode> it's advantageous to, because a large network can then be geographically distributed for its users, resulting in lower latency.
[22:00:08] <riv> i don't understand the engineering reasons people do it. All I can think is it costs more money
[22:00:28] <imode> well, the engineering reasons are... what happens if the one libera IRC server goes down?
[22:00:33] <imode> everybody's SOL.
[22:00:45] <drobilla> A literal single server can't support an Internet scale service
[22:00:46] <riv> I see
[22:01:08] <imode> fault tolerance means redundancy.
[22:01:11] <drobilla> Things that pretend to are just veneers on a bunch of servers anyway
[22:01:37] <imode> tell me about it..
[22:01:49] <riv> drobilla, but don't you have to send the same amount of data anyway?
[22:01:58] <imode> to where and to what?
[22:03:14] <riv> well say 100 clients all send a 1 byte message to 1 server. that is 100 bytes. Now suppose you have 10 servers, 10 users on each, each send 1 byte message: Now your server gets 10 messages from clients plus 9 messages from servers that contain 10 messages each
[22:03:22] <riv> so it comes out 100 bytes in either case
[22:03:44] <ngoldbaum> riv: if one server goes down then the whole network doesn’t go down, only the leaf nodes connected to the trunk node that went down
[22:03:55] <imode> right. but if one of those 10 servers go down, the rest of the 9 don't.
[22:04:08] <ngoldbaum> worse case you have a split brain that eventually resolves itself (netsplit)
[22:04:17] <imode> so you'd be sending 90 bytes/sec, for example, instead of 0, which is what happens when you choose a single server.
[22:04:58] <riv> could a single server handle as many clients as 10 servers though?
[22:05:08] <edk> if it was ten times as big
[22:05:08] <imode> debatable, but usually no.
[22:05:20] <riv> is it the number of connections that matters more than the amount of data coming in?
[22:05:27] <imode> it's both.
[22:05:40] <edk> one of the reasons we do it this way is that we get all our servers for free so we try to keep the resource requirements small
[22:06:09] <riv> edk, what resources exactly is that? RAM/CPU?
[22:06:15] <edk> both of those
[22:06:26] <imode> put it to you this way. a common way to shield yourself from some kind of blast or projectile is to distribute the force of that projectile over some area, so that one point isn't taking up all of the damage.
[22:06:33] <riv> so handling fewer connections lets you use less RAM and CPU
[22:06:44] <ngoldbaum> compare the stability of libera and matrix, which doesn’t distribute load across multiple servers…
[22:06:53] <imode> matrix doesn't?
[22:07:07] <riv> i haven't really used matrix in that way but i assume that it's much less stable?
[22:07:07] <imode> that's not that surprising the more I think about it, how could it.

[22:08:04] <imode> put it to you another way, riv. why don't we just build one giant solid concrete blob to hold up a bridge instead of multiple redundant beams, cables, etc.
[22:08:14] <drobilla> Never trust a single computer
[22:08:16] <riv> i am very skeptical about physical analogies
[22:08:17] <drobilla> No exceptions
[22:08:18] <edk> i don't know what the matrix.org homeserver is inside but it definitely contrives to look like just one server
[22:08:35] <imode> the concept of "distribution" applies to more than just computing.
[22:08:55] <imode> averaging some quantity over another quantity is how you gain efficiency.
[22:09:10] *** Quits: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:09:17] <imode> provided the cost of ramping the latter costs less than handling all of the former with less of the latter.
[22:09:25] <rhn> how loaded are IRC servers these days? the protocol is rather lightweight, could libera be hosted on a bunch of laptops with 56K modems?
[22:10:17] <edk> maybe not actually 56K but it's pretty light yes
[22:10:30] <riv> how many nodes is libera?
[22:10:34] <edk> we do tend to get attacked, though, which is a different story
[22:10:51] <edk> 25 apparently
[22:10:58] <rhn> fair enough, that alone will consume both bandwidth and computing power
[22:11:18] <riv> so 40k users over 25 servers, roughly 1600 users per server
[22:11:36] <drobilla> The severity of attacks would also probably increase if they actually could bring down the whole thing so easily
[22:11:50] <edk> not quite, some of the servers are not public-facing or are in inconvenient regions
[22:12:14] <edk> we don't ever point irc.libera.chat to asia or australia
[22:12:26] <rhn> if I was an attacker I would consider being able to take down one server motivating feedback
[22:12:29] <ngoldbaum> slack also goes down more than libera does
[22:12:32] <imode> why asia?
[22:12:46] <imode> australia I get.
[22:12:47] <riv> ok byt
[22:12:52] <riv> in terms of bandwidth
[22:12:54] *** Quits: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:13:02] <ngoldbaum> and if libera “goes down” usually that just means i dc and reconnect to the round-robin
[22:13:22] <imode> looooad balancing...
[22:13:23] <riv> the input is the same, but the output is actually less isn't it?
[22:13:27] <riv> I didn't realize this until now
[22:13:40] <rhn> compared to what?
[22:13:54] <riv> im comparing a single server to a set of servers
[22:14:20] <imode> the net bandwidth is greater if you're counting the cost of taking a single user's message and sending it to all other users.
[22:14:25] <riv> if you have a set of servers, the server has to output messages to each of its clients plus n-1 servers
[22:14:40] <riv> so thats #clients/n + (n-1) which is a lot less than #clients
[22:14:51] <edk> yes, each server gets to do less work
[22:14:52] <imode> right, so locally it's less.
[22:15:05] <riv> im happy now with this
[22:15:07] <imode> but the total bandwidth across all servers is greater, because of the forwarding to other servers.
[22:15:21] <imode> but that's on the order of 1 send per message per hop.
[22:15:23] <imode> so.
[22:15:44] <imode> not really "heavy" in terms of traffic, there's little amplification going on there.
[22:16:02] <edk> imode: asia same basic reason as australia, it's far away from most of our users and connectivity is patchy
[22:16:17] <imode> edk: ah fair, not up to speed as to the infra in that region.
[22:16:31] * rhn is surprised
[22:16:42] <rhn> is it patchy in general or patchy for Western services?
[22:17:28] <rhn> China/Korea/Japan sound like they shouldn't be behind on net
[22:17:50] <edk> mostly i'm trying to connect it to western stuff but i believe it's also not particularly cohesive even inside asia
[22:18:06] <edk> korea, japan, hong kong and singapore are ok

[22:29:02] <riv> ah

[22:32:10] <edk> well, there are n-1 edges in a spanning tree total
[22:32:44] <indigo> IIRC some IRC networks had "hub" servers and "leaf" servers
[22:34:51] <imode> if it's a tree then there has to be a root.
[22:35:26] <rhn> but it can be arbitrary if it's undirected, so w/e

[22:41:14] <rhn> if I calculated correctly, in a spanning tree each node has an average of (n-1) * 2/n neighbors
[22:41:59] <imode> so for a 25 node network that'd be 2 servers.
[22:42:39] <rhn> for any network it will be just below 2
[22:42:53] <drobilla> A spanning tree isn't necessarily minimal
[22:42:55] <rhn> a broken circle is a spanning tree too :)

[23:43:16] <mouseghost> ;-;
[23:43:30] <Ori_B> gotta keep track of what did what, and then you need to realize that this is a sort algorithm or whatever.
[23:43:39] <Ori_B> also: uh. anyone know what exactly a 'key authorization' is in the context of RFC8555?
[23:43:45] <Ori_B> (ACME)
[23:44:58] <Ori_B> in the DNS challenge section (8.4), it says you construct a key authorization, and then compute the sha256 digest of it.
[23:45:15] <Ori_B> I'm probably missing something, but a quick search through the RFC doesn't actually say ow to compute this authorization.
[23:48:33] <Ori_B> ah, wait, I am an idiot.
[23:49:04] <Ori_B> missed section 8.1
[23:50:44] <mouseghost> i just wanted to know how the data is sent.. but i guess this is too hard. how does anyone figure this out?
[23:51:01] <riv> what data?
[23:51:07] <mouseghost> in a program
[23:51:12] <mouseghost> i mean, i could just sniff it with wireshark
[23:51:15] <Ori_B> what data, sent where?
[23:51:19] <Ori_B> yes. that's what i'd do.
[23:51:24] <mouseghost> some json data, sent to some server
[23:51:30] <riv> hard to answer without knowing anything
[23:51:37] <Ori_B> yeah, wireshark or strace if you can do it.
[23:51:42] <mouseghost> i did it once, but now im too lazy and just wanted to try assembly
[23:51:51] <mouseghost> for example once i wanted to fiddle with paint tool sai
[23:52:02] <mouseghost> theres none of that, if im right
[23:52:15] <mouseghost> but one could figure out an algorithm for verification or something
[23:53:03] <mouseghost> is it only accessible to people with like +5 yrs of experience of what x-x
[23:53:52] <Ori_B> there's a reason people avoid reading and writing assembly by hand.
