[01:39:30] <MootPoot> it literally gives you a GUI to do it
[01:39:39] <Bco1981> it was plenty complicated to change a freaking netmask yesterday.

[01:40:31] <Satin> thank you pooters
[01:41:03] <listenurs> there a a lot of goodies in raspian i really how its a traditional lfs
[01:42:01] <listenurs> so yea the burden of sifting through unfamiliar its not the grandest time unless you can remember
[01:42:13] <Bco1981> i would like a raspbian amd64. would be so good for older pc's
[01:42:15] <Jigsy> So I went to a restaurant and asked for a "Word Salad" for my starter. They gave me profanity.
[01:42:31] <MootPoot> but yes, I dont see how something that literally gives you a GUI, with backup and easy edit capabilities is "hacky" feeling
[01:42:46] <MootPoot> and that GUI is built into every single windows install 
[01:42:55] <Jigsy> Only five more days of incessant Christmas music.
[01:43:06] <MootPoot> Jigsy: they'll forget to turn it off until feb
[01:43:08] <MootPoot> just you wait
[01:43:13] <Jigsy> They better not.

[01:46:07] <Bco1981> Satin: what do you need to change in there ?
[01:46:08] <listenurs> art is lost in win os
[01:46:08] <Satin> meanwhile most linux settings (I don't know much about servers, just talking as a casual user) has very straightforward .config files
[01:46:27] <Bco1981> Satin: you do know that you can rightclick the desktop to change your background right ?
[01:46:30] <Satin>  and utilities, and are very mdoular
[01:46:48] <Satin> Bco1981: I've used WIndows for a long time
[01:46:53] <Satin> ofc i know that
[01:47:03] * Satin can also do that in PopOS
[01:47:09] <Bco1981> but what do you need to change in the registry ?
[01:47:29] <listenurs> bco you can just alt f1 in fvwm
[01:47:54] <Satin> Bco1981: I'm not using the registry, that's a random screenshot from Wikipedia. I was just arguing MootPoot's point that linux's way of editing things is just as complicated as Window's Registry GUI.
[01:48:21] <Satin> Or rather, he think it's not complicated, which he probably is right of, once you learn its stuff.
[01:48:29] <Satin> But I still think Linux's way of doing things is more "straightforward"
[01:48:30] <Bco1981> i would say it's actually harder on linux, because you have to find the damn file you need to edit first.
[01:48:47] <Bco1981> atleast it's all in one place in the windows registry
[01:48:49] <Satin> I also think it is a bit "hacky"
[01:48:52] <Satin> in Windows registry
[01:48:56] <Satin> idk
[01:49:03] <MootPoot> Satin: you read the filename, you see what it changes, you click on it and you change it's value/flag
[01:49:08] <Satin> I haven't used it extensively to have a very informed or qualified opinion though I guess.
[01:49:08] <MootPoot> How is that hard 
[01:49:12] <MootPoot> No commands to learn 
[01:49:15] <MootPoot> Nothing 
[01:49:16] <MootPoot> Just read
[01:49:25] <Satin> that sounds limiting...
[01:49:37] <MootPoot> You don't need to do anything else in there 
[01:49:46] <MootPoot> Aside from alter values 
[01:49:52] <listenurs> and vscode is less inviting in windows environment
[01:49:54] <Satin> Weird.
[01:50:15] * Satin used to use Windows registry for random shit as an 11 year old
[01:50:26] <MootPoot> It's limiting in the same way you can't draw hentai with a tablet in the Linux terminal 
[01:50:29] <ffguest> Windows isn't good.
[01:50:31] <Satin> doing anything that isn't benig a normal user on Windows feels like a hack.
[01:50:37] <Satin> As opposed to its design.
[01:50:38] <MootPoot> Don't make it do stuff it wasent meant to 
[01:50:48] <Satin> Linux is very open and user-controllable on the other hand.
[01:50:57] <Satin> With the appropriate consequences of course.

[09:07:15] <omero> makes sense on hindsight I suppose
[09:08:19] <omero> in my case ... I wouldnt do that myself... when Im not standing at my main system... I do not want to be notified on my mobile every single nanosecond
[09:09:59] <omero> and extending the concept: why would I want to be tracking stuff on my mobile when Im already standing at my system?

[09:28:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Because WayDroid depends on direct access to Wayland's graphics buffer for performance reasons.
[09:29:05] <ButterNoodle> does wayland do the pixels better
[09:29:14] <ButterNoodle> oh there is a use case.. I just havent scrolled up
[09:29:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does rendering in a completely different way, yes.
[09:29:25] <ButterNoodle> *carry on
[09:33:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> WayDroid's FAQ was most particularly useless on that note. I had to look into the source to get just why it had a hard dependency.

[16:57:50] <Bco1981> psu is a cheap model, the cpu is 12 years i think, the ram is bought used on ebay

[18:00:12] <davic> Kinnevik for example owned Zalando which then got given out to the stocks owners
[18:00:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, How about AnimeCoin? :D
[18:00:26] <davic> so if you owned Kinnevik stonks you got Zalando stonks for free
[18:01:39] <davic> Sadale: and for example if you owned ICA Gruppen stonks for like 15 usd per stonk you would've gotten 35 usd for each stonk cuz of the purchase of the company
[18:01:41] <davic> ezpz
[18:02:25] <Sadale> davic, that makes no sense to me. How come the value of 15 USD just get turned into 35 USD immediately after Kinnevik purchases Zalando?
[18:02:41] <Sadale> What are the risks of buying this kind of stonks?

[18:04:00] <Sadale> davic, oh.

[18:04:46] <Sadale> davic, so if you buy ica gruppen stonk you can convert your ica gruppen stonk into Zalando stonk at 1-to-1 ratio, which'd immediately amplify your value from 15USD ICA Gruppen to 35USD Zalando

[18:06:09] <MootPoot> buying things that would have gone to the waste bin is ok
[18:06:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, yes. Now that you've purchased it and it's now *your* surplus.
[18:06:47] <MootPoot> hehe
[18:06:53] <MootPoot> but butter is teaching me the way
[18:07:19] <davic> Sadale: it was this:  0.195 Zalando shares per Kinnevik share
[18:08:05] <Sadale> davic, yes?
[18:08:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: I also got a managed network swtich that is worth about 200-300 dollars for 10 
[18:08:09] <davic> yes
[18:08:19] <Sadale> davic, how did you turn 15USD into 35 then?
[18:08:29] <davic> Sadale: in the ica gruppen one
[18:08:34] <davic> which isnt tied to kinnevik
[18:08:42] <Sadale> ah
[18:08:46] <tsukkin> you could get all of that stuff for free by simply shoplifting 
[18:09:06] <Sadale> davic, ah. After the purchase of ICA gruppen it just raised from 15USD to 35USD.
[18:09:15] <davic> yes
[18:09:27] <davic> or well it went from like 35 usd to 54 usd now
[18:09:34] <Sadale> davic, And if you owned Kinnevik stonks you got Zalando stonks for free (0.195 Zalando shares per Kinnevik share)
[18:09:41] <davic> yes
[18:09:53] <Sadale> davic, yeah I've heard this kind of shit before. But sounds rather risky. What if the purchase deal died?
[18:10:21] <davic> Sadale: this ica gruppen one is ok because the buyers are the one that owned it
[18:10:26] <davic> and the buyers are the owners of the stores
[18:10:54] <Sadale> Only if you voted. I suspect that a few big shareholders would dominate the votes.
[18:11:17] <davic> Sadale: well they already owned like 53%

[21:29:22] <snake> grats
[21:29:32] <snake> i usually just install what i need to a usb, and then erase it after
[21:30:23] <MootPoot> I have a bunch of different systems in different places
[21:30:38] <MootPoot> so what I usually do is just have a seperate usb for each system
[21:30:43] <MootPoot> win10 install, linux install, etc
[21:31:41] <ButterNoodle> hi
[21:31:50] <MootPoot> I figured I needed to make a dedicated exsi install usb or something
[21:31:56] <MootPoot> and tape it to the box 
[21:31:57] <ButterNoodle> problem is more than likely the bios setu
[21:32:17] <MootPoot> reset all to default and then redo?
[21:32:21] <ButterNoodle> try that
[21:32:34] <ButterNoodle> remember what I said about going into the controller setup
[21:32:40] <ButterNoodle> ctrl-p
[21:32:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It is I.
[21:32:56] <ButterNoodle> define single disk volumes
[21:33:03] <ButterNoodle> cause perc dont do jbod
[21:34:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> i.e.: Perc is kinda shit. Get an LSI sas controller and ensure it can do jbod.
[21:35:06] <MootPoot> perc? LSI???
[21:35:10] <MootPoot> jbod????????
[21:35:14] <MootPoot> ?????????????????????????
[21:35:26] * MootPoot googles
[21:35:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> jbod => just a bunch of disks, perc => shit controller by Dell that only does hardware raid, hardware raid => shit, LSI => Some company

[21:40:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Corporate pride or something.
[21:40:26] <ButterNoodle> I mean no controller exists that has zfs integrated
[21:40:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> More truthful answer is that it was trendy to do hardware raid in the past.
[21:40:35] <ButterNoodle> and it is just an lsi
[21:40:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But hardware raid is a dumb idea and shouldn't be done. Partly because bugs are hard to patch and require downtime.
[21:41:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The minimal performance gain is not worth the downsides.
[21:41:08] <ButterNoodle> ask any enterprise storage person.. hardware raid is still a thing

[21:41:17] <ButterNoodle> m
[21:41:18] <ButterNoodle> c
[21:41:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And the advent of ZFS has made the point moot because hardware raid is unambiguously inferior to ZFS
[21:41:55] <ButterNoodle> I mean we can debate hardware vs open sores software raid all day
[21:42:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Just because they're wrong and believe themselves to be right doesn't mean they're right.
