[00:07:46] <TheWhisper> gwern, have you done any research or compiled any information on blue-light therapy? Most days, even when getting enough sleep that my body wakes up without an alarm, I operate at 50% mental capacity up until around 4 or 5 PM. At which time my brain clears up and I feel very energized, and I can focus on deep work. I googled around a bit and people suggest that blue-light therapy can help with this. (I also was diagnosed with ADHD decades ago,
[00:07:46] <TheWhisper>  and people posit that ADHD is often comorbid with Delayed-Phase Sleep Disorder [which I'm not thinking I have, but who knows], and blue-light therapy helps with that).
[00:08:50] <Gurkenglas> try a melatonin spray.

[00:12:38] <TheWhisper> Gurkenglas, I previously took both (not simultaneously) sub-mg doses and supra-3-mg doses of melatonin. While I did see some positive effects with the larger doses, they made me very irritable and I built tolerance quickly. Not a great solution for me in the long term
[00:14:15] <Gurkenglas> I only used low doses. Starting it instantly made my sleep cycle stop rotating. I note that getting a more comfortable chair made me more susceptible again to staying out of bed through the ~45-minute window after spraying.
[00:15:03] <TheWhisper> I found this incredibly well-researched experimental protocol for training "non24" DPSD: https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html
[00:15:04] <Robomot> SleepNon24VLiDACMel - VLiDACMel therapy for entrainment of treatment-resistant sighted non24
[00:15:13] <TheWhisper> and the main therapeutic they use is blue-light therapy

[00:16:30] <TheWhisper> Gurkenglas, what melatonin spray? I guess I could try it. According to this protocol though, while it does help, it is not as necessary if you use BLT and don't use stimulants
[00:16:37] <TheWhisper> (and I don't use any stimulants)
[00:16:48] <TheWhisper> > Melatonin is not necessary for entrainment if very long bright light therapy and dark therapy are used and no stimulant (eg, caffeine) is consumed. But it is still recommended to use melatonin at first, to consolidate the circadian rhythm faster and magnify the sleepiness feeling so that you can better recognize when your body can sleep. However, it can cause drowsiness up to 48h, hence after a few weeks, either lower dosage or melatonin can
[00:16:48] <TheWhisper>  be discontinued.
[00:17:41] <Gurkenglas> I agree that the melatonin spray's purpose is to reject light-based sleep rhythm and substitute your own; and if the light rhythm is already correct then you don't need it.
[00:18:38] <TheWhisper> Yeah, I don't think I have DPSD, but I do think I have poor light exposure/light rhythm
[00:18:50] <pompolic> IRC delayed my sleep phase

[03:37:57] <gwern> it's so loud and pounding and manipulative
[03:38:26] <gwern> I remembered to grab a captioning device, although I didn't need it, and I kept rolling my eyes as '[DRAMATIC MUSIC]' came on
[03:38:42] <adiabatic> maybe his thing for Headspace is way chiller
[03:38:57] <adiabatic> although, it's just the right amount of dramatic for a workday
[03:39:06] <galambo__> adiabatic, well for starters you need a high end audio setup. otherwise it is lost on you.
[03:39:35] <adiabatic> mhm, that's part of the problem. what Headspace gives me is, like, 93kbps MP3 or something noticeably awful
[03:40:35] <galambo__> adiabatic, why not just download the music from soulseek or deemix?
[03:40:59] <adiabatic> I'm too honest to pirate and I don't think it's available on albums from anywhere
[03:41:19] <adiabatic> it's one of those "we don't let you even download it" things on Headspace (nominally a meditation app)_
[03:43:02] <saturn2> it seems very silly to put '[DRAMATIC MUSIC]' captions in. every movie has that, you can just assume it's there
[03:43:20] <adiabatic> sometimes they have other kinds of music too
[03:43:55] <gwern> saturn2: no, it makes sense. if I had to criticize it, it's that it's redundant because when zimmer does his damn soundtrack, even the deaf will *feel* the dramatic music -_-
[03:44:18] <gwern> (as I've mentioned, the deaf listen to a lot more music than you would think, and it's super-obnoxious)
[03:45:57] <adiabatic> I missed this, so stupid-question time. what's there to enjoy other than the bass
[03:46:03] <adiabatic> and lots of it
[03:46:36] <galambo__> adiabatic, the mids and the treble
[03:47:39] <adiabatic> …
[03:47:46] <gwern> adiabatic: 'bass' covers a lot, and there's typically at least a little residual hearing at all frequencies so if you crank everythig to MAX.... this is why the deaf kids at NTID live in their own dorm
[03:47:49] <adiabatic> In different ratios than the rest of uss?

[03:48:11] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[03:49:02] <galambo__> I thought people with reduced hearing would prefer higher treble becasue thats where the losses tend to be more pronounced
[03:49:03] <saturn2> adiabatic: if the actors fail to convey the dramatic-ness of a scene, it's not like putting a [DRAMATIC MUSIC] caption on it will have any effect
[03:49:08] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[03:49:15] <galambo__> hence younger people prefer bass and older people perfer treble
[03:49:47] <Obormot\Gaia> Just got an email from Google like... "new mobile usability issue detected on readthesequences.com"
[03:49:56] <gwern> I think that's just an age effect of music genre. young people hear high frequencies much better. hearing loss is typically heavily skewed: you lose high faster than low
[03:50:19] <Obormot\Gaia> And it's not even a new thing, it's their "clickable elements too close together nonsense" again
[03:50:21] <gwern> that's how those 'teenager repellents' work with the high-pitched noise, and of course anyone with hearing loss can see their own audiograms and how they've typically lost more at high frequencies
[03:50:47] <galambo__> yes thats what I meant to say sorry I wasnt clear
[03:51:13] <Obormot\Gaia> (Note that when I go to the pagetest UI and go "test the actual live page that's supposedly problematic", it comes up 100% green!)
[03:51:27] <saturn2> ironically if you don't go to loud concerts you'll still be able to hear "teenager repellents" well into middle-age
[03:51:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Literally just Google going "nice website you got there, shame if something... happened to its search ranking"
[03:52:08] <galambo__> Obormot\Gaia, I think your website is perfect as is. any modification would make it less perfect
[03:52:53] <gwern> (not that the subtitles are perfect. I'm sure I spotted at one point a reference to 'Princess Jasmine')
[03:53:09] <adiabatic> oops
[03:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo__: Thanks. I agree that there's not much to add. Not nothing, though. But more importantly, there's always the spectre of browser updates adding bugs where before there were none...
[03:53:31] <adiabatic> irulan, jasmine, wozza diff
[03:55:25] <saturn2> Obormot\Gaia: that seems to randomly happen once in a while, maybe because the CSS didn't load for some reason
[03:57:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The spurious Google pagetest error thing, you mean?
[03:57:25] <gwern> adiabatic: it was lady jessica. irulan is one of many characters cut (not that I recall her being in the first half much anyway)
[03:58:09] <gwern> (the movie ends at killing Jamis, signifying Paul is no longer refusing the Call and has decided to save his sorry ass by leading jihad)
[03:58:35] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah

[07:10:27] <quanticle> Apparently they were closed as part of the post-9/11 panic because someone noticed that the restrooms shared a ventilation system with the main subway terminal and "zOMG what if the turrirsts mix poison gas in the bathrooms??????"

[08:09:44] <PapuaHardyNet> is that [1] a footnote?
[08:09:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> [1] Taking "happy" here to mean, like, eudaemonia, value of life, etc., not necessarily "happiness" per se, which is a mostly useless concept
[08:10:41] <saturn2> so the most moral thing to do is kill everyone else and then wirehead yourself?
[08:10:51] <rmmh> I suppose there's some underpinning of the hedonic treadmill here
[08:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, tbh, "worse"/"better" are questionable terms here, since I think that person-centered / person-affecting ethics are obviously correct
[08:11:10] <rmmh> I don't think populations tend to actually be massively happier or more miserable apart from certain exterme events
[08:11:12] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: that's what everyone is already doing unconsciously: when resources get tighter, people get more and more ruthless
[08:11:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I mean, that would be worse, so, no
[08:11:22] <saturn2> oh
[08:11:23] <PapuaHardyNet> and people mostly try to ineffectively wirehead themselves anyway
[08:11:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: If nothing else, wireheading clearly falls afoul of the clarification in [1]
[08:12:48] <nshepperd2> having to kill billions of people seems bad for one's eudaimonia
[08:12:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And yet, more books and papers about the Repugnant Conclusion have not helped us understand what to do about climate change, or reproductive healthcare, or the education of girls in developing countries, or dwindling fertility rates in rich countries."

[08:14:30] <Robomot> Obormot\Arcturus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox
[08:14:30] <Robomot> The mere addition paradox, also known as the repugnant conclusion, is a problem in ethics, identified by Derek Parfit and discussed in his book Reasons and Persons (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations. Parfitâ€™s original formulation of the repugnant conclusion is that, â€œFor any perfe…
[08:14:31] <Robomot> …ctly equal population with very high positive welfare, there is a population with very low positive welfare which is better, other things being equal.â€
[08:14:51] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[08:15:24] <rmmh> I find it incredibly hard to point at a population and say "you would be better off not existing"
[08:15:35] <saturn2> how do i know whether my life is barely worth living?
[08:15:41] <rmmh> it's basically limited to uh, extreme mental disability
[08:15:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Imagine it being slightly worse, would you not want to live then
[08:15:56] <rmmh> or horrifically painful terminal illnesses
[08:16:04] <saturn2> idk
[08:16:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: That's why person-centric ethics
[08:16:38] <PapuaHardyNet> wow, this wikipedia page is complicated
[08:16:42] <saturn2> i probably wouldn't commit suicide, but that seems like a different question
[08:16:44] *** Joins: galambo (galambo@user/galambo)
[08:17:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: The question "should X existing persons just kill themselves or what" is not even slightly the same question as "we could create a bunch of people with properties Y, should we?"
[08:17:00] <rmmh> saturn2: I can conceive of various terminal illnesses that would make me kill myself
[08:17:11] <saturn2> sure
[08:17:33] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: perhaps a good way to estimate is to evaluate every person's QOL on a percentile index
[08:17:43] <PapuaHardyNet> and if their QOL is at 5% then suicide is sensible?
[08:17:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not a good way at all
[08:17:51] <PapuaHardyNet> 5 percentile, sorry
[08:18:15] <saturn2> that would mean only 19 people could remain alive
[08:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if we're all in the Garden of Eden and every last person is happy? Should the least happy ones (who are still having fun all the time and thanking God for being alive every day) still off themselves?
[08:18:42] <nshepperd2> a shadowy cabal of the worlds 19 happiest people
[08:18:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if everyone's equally happy and the SD of the happiness distribution is literally zero??
[08:19:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then who's for the suicide booths, eh??
[08:20:22] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: percentile in terms of QOL, meaning at 5 percentile, only 5% of the population has equal or less QOL, so that would be about... 45 million people who would qualify for suicide
[08:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After all, some said, it was never exactly spelled out why the Repugnant Conclusion was supposed to be so wrong in the first place. Parfit’s own explanation was that a world in which a few people had the best experiences in life had to be better than a world in which more people had only “lower pleasures.” Otherwise, the best things — the best symphonies, for example — wouldn’t exist. But this sort of elitism has
[08:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  no place in ethics." ... yeah, god forbid we value symphonies, or, like, good things in general
[08:20:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's ELITISM and that is Very Bad.
[08:21:27] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: but once those people commit suicide, the 5%ile mark would be higher, requiring more people to commit suicide, and so on
[08:21:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Such an account would also have to explain why the Repugnant Conclusion is so special. How is it different from all of the other similar conclusions in population ethics and economics that make similar claims about large and small sets of people?" ... oh no, what if all of population ethics is meaningless! uhhh quick guys come up with some bullshit to prevent anyone from thinking about that
[08:22:04] <PapuaHardyNet> Cs get degrees man, you don't have to keep the 5%ile mark, you can quantify it as a fixed QOL

[08:23:05] <Robomot> image/png (586x244; 22 KB)
[08:23:18] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: obviously the main problem with this is that your 5% mark is arbitrary and there is no reason whatsoever to expect it to be the right number
[08:24:01] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, but do you think the principle is incorrect? letting people accurately know their QOL in comparison to the people around them should help them have a better idea of whether their life is worth living or not, correct?
[08:24:12] <nshepperd2> yes the principle is incorrect
[08:24:25] <PapuaHardyNet> all right, do tell me how
[08:24:53] <nshepperd2> i don't see why i should have to kill myself just bc other people are happier
[08:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A few weeks before COVID-19 shut down everything, some of us philosophers and economists gathered at the University of Texas in Austin. We met to share research about the interactions among climate change, population change, and economic policy. Over dinner, we confessed to one another that we did not think that figuring out what to do about population policies required avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion." ... well, time to
[08:25:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  retire all them philosophers and economists, then
[08:25:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Get us some new ones, that aren't evil
[08:25:35] <nshepperd2> surely if my life wasn't worth living i'd be able to notice this without comparing myself to someone else
[08:25:52] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: that's not the point - you don't have to kill yourself. having an accurate metric of your QOL compared to that of other people gives you a better idea of your own life and whether it is worth living
[08:26:06] <rmmh> I think it just makes yo usad
[08:26:11] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: why?
[08:26:28] <PapuaHardyNet> society and the people around you constantly gaslight you (not you specifically, but people in general) as to whether their life is worth living on one hand
[08:26:30] <rmmh> quality of life isn't objective
[08:26:41] <PapuaHardyNet> on the other, depression and other mental health issues also skew your perspective
[08:26:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We also quickly realized that we came from different perspectives. So we wrote down as much agreement as we could. The first point of agreement is this: “avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion is not a necessary condition for a minimally adequate… approach to population ethics.” That does not claim that the Repugnant Conclusion is true (some of us think it is, some of us think it’s not). Instead, it suggests a reallocation
[08:26:50] <Obormot\Arcturus>  of attention." ... oh, I see. They're not evil, they're just intellectually lazy cowards
[08:27:02] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: that's right! which is why QOL can and will only be relatively measured
[08:27:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We can't solve the mere addition paradox so let's just uhhhh give up and just stop talking about *shrug*"
[08:27:17] <rmmh> I think this is most obviously true if you look at oppressed groups
[08:27:29] <rmmh> where as long as they don't realize how screwed they are they can persist for a long time
[08:27:54] <nshepperd2> population ethics is hard, let's go drinking
[08:28:11] <saturn2> what if population ethics is based on an abstraction that will never be measurable and, in fact, cannot make sense
[08:28:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: So, to be clear, your operationalization of "worth living" is "is within some fixed percentile of the lower bound of life quality across all existing humans"?
[08:28:58] <nshepperd2> saturn2: utilitarianism might be
[08:29:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Because if so, it's a failed attempt at operationalization, as it has no construct validity - it's simply not measuring anything remotely like what anyone means when they talk about whether someone's life is worth living or not
[08:29:29] <nshepperd2> population ethics is just the concept of like, having an opinion on whether there should be more people and how, isn't it
[08:30:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if the real population ethics is the trillions of friends we create along the way (to the glorious posthuman future)

[09:19:17] <feep[work]> maybe eliezer
[09:19:42] <feep[work]> unless he's countersignaling
[09:21:02] * quanticle recalls an amusing thread from DataSecretsLox where the membership found it almost offensive that people considered them rationalists
[09:21:09] <linear> he seems kinda rat-adj-ish in mindset/followers but definitely not in here
[09:21:43] <feep[work]> "rationalist-adjacent", adj.: Rationalists who are not close enough to the inner core to be disillusioned.
[09:22:03] <saturn2> he's in the LW telegram group
[09:22:25] <linear> although if you count anyone that reads/enjoys SSC/LW/hpmor/gwern/etc etc as rat-adj, the term has a lot less meaning
[09:22:37] <PapuaHardyNet> hey linear
[09:22:58] <feep[work]> linear: like ... *isn't* that the meaning?
[09:22:58] <linear> heyo
[09:23:35] <linear> feep[work]: I'm... not sure, I guess I would say it depends on how much they ~identify~ with the group(s)/people? if they're participating in discussions and keeping up with things, yes. If they just read a scott or gwern post from HN or reddit, probably not
[09:23:55] <feep[work]> rationalist-tangent :D
[09:24:08] <quanticle> They touched rationality once, then said never again?
[09:24:11] <feep[work]> yes
[09:24:14] <quanticle> lol
[09:24:16] <linear> it's quite possible
[09:25:02] <quanticle> So then if I read Gwern and SSC but no other rationality or rationality adjacent blogs, does that make me rationalist secant?
[09:26:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Rationalist-secant
[09:27:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Periodically moves through the periphery of the rat-sphere, stirs up some shit, then leaves again
[09:27:15] <kuudes> I guess I am in the camp of "mere addition paradox is not a paradox
[09:27:16] <kuudes> "
[09:27:25] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: So... Valentine?
[09:27:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess
[09:28:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I mean, yeah, me too. Several of the assumptions / "intuitions" are clearly wrong
[09:28:21] <kuudes> yes
[09:28:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> The background assumptions are also problematic
[09:28:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole thing is built on a lot of naive utilitarianism and stuff like that
[09:28:42] <kuudes> yes
[09:29:00] <kuudes> if you accept the premise, it is just consistent, best state is either A or B
[09:29:12] <kuudes> and ordering is consistent
[09:29:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> This really falls into the category of "Derek Parfit is not nearly as impressive as many people think for some reason"
[09:29:26] <kuudes> yes.
[09:29:29] <kuudes> strong agree
[09:29:53] <saturn2> why do people think he's impressive?
[09:30:02] <kuudes> also "philosophical thought experiments are often wrong"
[09:30:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I think many rationalist-types strongly empathize with his extreme-scrupulosity shit
[09:30:11] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs224058.centertel.pl) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[09:30:41] <kuudes> but on actionable level personally I have just tabooed number of children from policies
[09:31:06] <kuudes> ie "it happens when life gets better, people get less kids. thats ok."
[09:31:09] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: that makes sense
[09:31:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That's just an uncharitable hypothesis though, I've always had a hard time getting through any of his writings without getting angry at his steady stream of constant unwarranted assumptions and dubious logic
[09:31:43] <kuudes> but "saying you should not get kids because of climate change is bad and so is saying you should get kids for future of humanity, too"
[09:31:48] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs224058.centertel.pl)
[09:32:04] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, sounds like you get rationalist points from that
[09:32:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess
[09:32:14] <kuudes> +1
[09:33:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: As for the kids thing, I agree on the whole, but one can imagine reasonable exceptions, yes? To take a practical case - after WW2 the Soviet government took various steps to encourage more kids-having... of course we can debate whether their methods were ok or not, but it does seem to me like that was a genuine society-level interest in encouraging procreation
[09:34:41] <kuudes> I feel wary on that, too
[09:34:52] <kuudes> same for islamic similar reaction
[09:35:03] <kuudes> or chinese one child and now multiple child policies
[09:35:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wary as in, you don't think that really was a genuine exception?
[09:35:13] <saturn2> scrupulosity and its consequences have been a disaster for the rationalist race
[09:35:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[09:35:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not wrong though
[09:36:33] <kuudes> I feel if I were a decision maker and started to affect other people's number of children from some outside-of-them reason, it seems too likely I would be making some sort of error, so I try to have little opinion on it and feel people who have strong opinions on it often are likely either mistaken or evil
[09:37:12] <kuudes> I am maybe more fine with enabling people to have children they want and no more, but I am unsure about that as well
[09:37:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, again, I agree that that's a solid general principle
[09:37:24] <kuudes> basicly I sense "this way be gas chambers"
[09:37:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just not obvious to me that there can't be very well-motivated exceptions
[09:37:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like the example I gave
[09:38:06] <kuudes> well russia still has very anomalous population structure, so it has not been at least a complete success
[09:38:14] <kuudes> .wp demographics of russia
[09:38:17] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, had a population of 142.8 million according to the 2010 census, with a ratio of 1.16 women to 1 man approximately, which rose to 146.2 million as of 2021 following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.
[09:38:36] <feep[work]> damn
[09:38:40] <feep[work]> there were a lot of women in crimea
[09:38:44] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia#/media/File:RUS_SbA1y20210101.png was the chart that was first to make me weep when I understood what it meant
[09:38:45] <Robomot> Demographics of Russia - Wikipedia (Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, had a population of 142.8 million according to the 2010 census,[11] with a ratio of 1.16 women to 1 man approximately, which rose to 146.2 million as of 2021 following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.[ …)
[09:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be very strange to trace Russia's current demographic problems to procreation-encouraging policies in the aftermath of WW2
[09:39:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't see any connection, tbh
[09:39:14] <kuudes> well ww1 and ww2 caused those waves
[09:39:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> At the very least, it seems to me that we have an existence proof of the possibility of childbirth-decision-affecting policies that, *even when implemented in a literally Stalinist dictatorship*, do not lead to gas chambers or anything really resembling gas chambers
[09:39:37] <feep[work]> lemme fix that hang on
[09:39:48] <kuudes> I guess the correct approach in smoothing them would be to encourage wider age differences in spouses
[09:40:39] <kuudes> encouraging just larger families does little to alleviate those waves
[09:40:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't follow
[09:41:10] <kuudes> hmm?
[09:41:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> What waves? Why doesn't encourage larger families alleviate them?
[09:42:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just not clear to me what you're referring to at all right now
[09:42:16] <nshepperd2> waves in the gas chambers
[09:42:31] <feep[work]> .wp demographics of russia
[09:42:35] <feepbot> feep[work]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, had a population of 142.8 million according to the 2010 census, which rose to 146.2 million as of 2021 following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Its population has an approximate ratio of 1.16 women to 1 man.
[09:42:37] <feep[work]> better.
[09:42:40] <kuudes> there are twice the people born in 1987 than there are people born in 1998 in russia
[09:43:02] <feep[work]> (if less funny ^^)
[09:43:10] <kuudes> because there are twice the number of parents to people born in 1987 than for people born in 1998
[09:43:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[09:43:25] <kuudes> yes
[09:43:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're gonna have to explain that
[09:43:46] <kuudes> war killed the people who were about 20 years old during the war
[09:44:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> War killed a lot more than people who were about 20 years old...
[09:44:04] <kuudes> therefore there are similarly less people in the year their kids would have been born
[09:44:16] <kuudes> yes. but it killed birthing age females
[09:44:26] <kuudes> so there are fewer wombs to deliver babies in those ages
[09:44:36] <saturn2> maybe it had something to do with the economic situation around that time
[09:44:41] <feep[work]> a clear failing of communist policy
[09:44:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think that works, kuudes
[09:44:56] <kuudes> no other country I have seen has this
[09:45:08] <kuudes> saturn2, it is russia only, not france or germany or finland or uk
[09:45:17] <feep[work]> shouldn't germany have it?
[09:45:23] <kuudes> germany does not have it
[09:45:31] <feep[work]> right but shouldn't it
[09:45:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> In 1998, someone who was 20 during WW2 would've been in their 70s
[09:45:40] <kuudes> germany did not have women to the front
[09:45:48] <kuudes> yes
[09:45:58] <kuudes> and they have had their children who have had their children
[09:46:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> That doesn't make any sense
[09:46:21] <kuudes> those dips come from generation lacking birthing people

[09:47:18] <kuudes> feep[work], russia put all its women to military or something
[09:47:26] <feep[work]> oic
[09:47:31] <feep[work]> well um that seems    a choice
[09:47:37] <kuudes> they had much more dead women of birthing age than rest of countries
[09:47:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I think you're just wrong about this, tbh. That account makes very little sense. It's vastly more likely that the decline in birth rate was due to the economic situation in Russian in the 1990s
[09:47:54] <kuudes> so we lack the children of those dead women and the children of the children of the dead women
[09:47:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> *vastly* more likely
[09:48:00] <kuudes> no
[09:48:03] <kuudes> this repeats
[09:48:07] <kuudes> and can be predicted
[09:48:15] <kuudes> russia has very anomalous demographics
[09:48:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russia has very anomalous a lot of things
[09:48:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> For a lot of reasons
[09:48:31] <kuudes> population growth there is much more disconnected from temporal economics etc
[09:48:41] <kuudes> because there the odd and even generations are 1:2
[09:48:47] <feep[work]> wikipedia says russia only even had 800k women in the armed forces
[09:48:52] <kuudes> whereas in "normal" situation they are ~1:1
[09:49:07] <kuudes> ie people do not procreate with people 10 year different from their age
[09:49:21] <kuudes> so it matters if there are 2:1 people in 30 age and 20 age
[09:49:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure they do
[09:49:25] <feep[work]> kuudes: the numbers just don't seem big enough to support anything.
[09:49:34] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, rarely
[09:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know several examples just from my own family!
[09:49:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not rarely!
[09:49:50] <kuudes> yes, and in russia that is maybe good
[09:49:55] <kuudes> that is an actual solution for this
[09:49:57] <feep[work]> russia had 196 million people in 1941
[09:50:00] <kuudes> to make the waves to be smoother
[09:50:15] <feep[work]> assuming an even gender split, that's 98 million women
[09:50:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Sure, sure, but it also severely undermines your theory, as do, like... tons of other things
[09:50:24] <feep[work]> only about 1% of those were involved in the war
[09:50:39] <feep[work]> directly*
[09:50:53] <feep[work]> were military*
[09:51:20] <feep[work]> so you either have to explain why civilian deaths were biased a lot towards women, or why a death rate of 1% makes such a huge difference
[09:51:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1033851/fertility-rate-russia-1840-2020/
[09:51:44] <Robomot> •  Russia: fertility rate 1840-2020 | Statista (The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years.)
[09:51:53] <nshepperd2> 1% sure doesn't seem like 2:1
[09:52:06] <feep[work]> well, google might be feeding me wrong information
[09:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> This graph doesn't look anything like what it would have to look like for what you say to be plausible
[09:52:09] <feep[work]> tbf
[09:52:51] <kuudes> the fertility rate there looks quite similar to other countries, Obormot\Arcturus
[09:53:16] <kuudes> and fertility rate is not in conflict
[09:53:22] <kuudes> there just are less birthing women
[09:53:39] <kuudes> but on average, each of them births about equal amount of children *per woman*
[09:53:48] <kuudes> fertility rate is *per woman*
[09:53:53] <saturn2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_bulgaria bulgaria has a similar shape but i don't think it took that many losses in ww2?
[09:53:54] <Robomot> Demographics of Bulgaria - Wikipedia (The demography of the Republic of Bulgaria is monitored by the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria. …)
[09:53:55] <kuudes> if there are less women, -> less children
[09:54:19] <kuudes> no it does not have same, saturn2
[09:54:24] <kuudes> they only have 1 dip
[09:54:27] <kuudes> russia has waves
[09:54:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> In 1941-45, the number of men in the Soviet Union killed by the war was ~20 million; women, ~6.5 million
[09:54:40] <kuudes> ie it has constant up nodes and down nodes that are birth year dependent
[09:54:55] <ggreer> my 2015 macbook has a battery health of... 0%. that's not good. if I unplug it, it immediately powers off :(
[09:55:00] <kuudes> and has wavelength of about 20 years or so
[09:55:06] <saturn2> ok, but it has a huge drop around 1990 like russia
[09:55:09] <ggreer> I replaced the battery in 2017 but I guess it finally had some sort of major fault
[09:55:18] <kuudes> yes, and the drop is "ok" compared to the waves
[09:55:27] <kuudes> different thing
[09:55:43] <quanticle> ggreer: That happened to my work computer a while back, though, that was a 2019 Macbook Pro
[09:55:47] <ggreer> I wonder if they still repair these old macbooks. nothing apple makes is as small anymore

[09:56:08] <kuudes> we need an historical population pyramid, or animation, but with 1  year cohorts

[10:01:56] <kuudes> it is not normal for a school to have pupil counts from grade 1 onwards of: 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, 100
[10:02:33] <kuudes> and in 5 years: 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180
[10:02:53] <kuudes> and that is not explained by people suddenly deciding to get more kids per woman
[10:03:02] <kuudes> but by there being more or less women in cohort
[10:03:47] <kuudes> fertility does not change by factor of 2 in 10 years
[10:03:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is it not explained by people deciding to have more kids?
[10:04:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why wouldn't fertility change by a factor of 2 in 10 years??
[10:04:08] <kuudes> because it is matched by the number of women in birthing age
[10:04:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> This obviously not only can but *did* happen
[10:04:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look at that graph I posted!
[10:05:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Between 1930 and 1945, fertility rate in Russia went from 6.36 to 2.58!!
[10:05:49] <kuudes> that is 15 years
[10:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, and?
[10:05:56] <kuudes> which 10 year difference has 2:1
[10:06:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Looks like ~1932 to ~1942
[10:07:15] <kuudes> that has only years ending in 0 or 5?
[10:07:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I feel like you're nitpicking
[10:07:39] <kuudes> 1935 had 4.49 and 1945 had 2.58
[10:07:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this 15 year period fertility rate went down by a factor of ~2.5
[10:07:59] <kuudes> 1930 had 6.36 and 1940 had 4.73
[10:08:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok but so what though?
[10:09:11] <kuudes> 1930:1945 is 1.82:1 per 10 years
[10:09:28] <kuudes> yes, I agree, that is not hitting the crux
[10:09:37] <kuudes> the crux is that cohort size in russia has also went up
[10:09:41] <kuudes> by similar 2:1
[10:09:44] <kuudes> in 10 years
[10:09:53] <kuudes> and the fertility ratio does not have anything on that
[10:10:03] <kuudes> it goes up and down in waves
[10:10:18] <kuudes> if it was from fertility rate, those waves should show on fertility rate. they do not
[10:10:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cohort size as in...?
[10:10:27] <kuudes> how many persons are born in a calendar year
[10:10:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would fertility rates not affect that?
[10:10:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> How could they possibly not affect that?
[10:10:51] <kuudes> they do. but they do not affect it enough
[10:11:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I still don't understand what these waves are that you're seeing

[10:12:05] <kuudes> look at the live births column
[10:12:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, I'm looking
[10:12:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> What about it
[10:12:30] <kuudes> notice how it peaked in 1972 and later in 1987
[10:12:43] <kuudes> and then again in 2012
[10:12:57] <nshepperd2> it seems ridiculous to look at these population charts and pretend this huge variations in fertility rate have nothing to do with it
[10:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It also peaked in 1949, then in 1954... the '49 peak is much bigger than the '72 peak, by the way
[10:15:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you account for the number of live births being so much higher in 1949 than in 1972, by the way, given your theory? The population was increasing *monotonically* that whole time!
[10:15:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> If all the 20 year old women were killed in the war, how were they having all those kids in 1949?
[10:15:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole thing makes no sense, sorry dude

[10:16:59] <kuudes> number of children has went down, but also up
[10:17:05] <kuudes> and it goes so in waves in russia
[10:17:17] <kuudes> because the number of people giving births goes up and down similarly
[10:17:33] <kuudes> the ratio of birthers/births indeed can vary, and has done so about monotonically
[10:17:44] <kuudes> but that does not cause those waves of up
[10:18:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I think you're seeing spurious patterns and explaining them with dubious explanations
[10:20:34] <kuudes> next bottom of birth cohort in russia will happen in about 2030. in 2040 there will be more babies born than in 2030
[10:21:21] <kuudes> and in 2060 there will be less babies born than in 2050
[10:21:35] <kuudes> but in 2075 more than in 2065

[10:49:44] <Kol> kuudes: why does the decline take 20 years to show? wouldn't the decline happen at the time of war?
[10:49:52] <synthmeat> question for eu guys - what's the, tax-wise, ideal entity to form (or do you even need one) for freelancers in your country?
[10:51:07] <Kol> oh, because not enough males & more importantly females are born during the war
[10:51:53] <kuudes> well, the war killed "the next generation of parents"
[10:51:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Look, here's a basic sanity check: the fertility rate in Russian in 1999 was ~1.16. In 1987 it was ~2.22. Correspondingly, the total per-population birth rates were 8.3 and 17.2 respectively. The *total population*, however, was 147m and 145m, i.e., almost no difference.
[10:52:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Now how exactly do you link that to different numbers of women?
[10:52:29] <kuudes> synthmeat, I recommend a stock corporation
[10:52:41] <kuudes> total population does not matter that much
[10:52:44] <Kol> are there any resources for population pyramids over history?
[10:52:45] <kuudes> because it is over 100 years
[10:52:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why 100
[10:53:02] <kuudes> well there are people who are alive
[10:53:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... yes?
[10:53:46] <kuudes> if you take average over multiple generations, that is constantish
[10:53:59] <kuudes> the point is that between generations the size varies by 2:1
[10:54:31] <kuudes> but if you just sum generation that is 2 with a generation that is 1, and compare that pair to next, then there is little change, sure
[10:54:44] <synthmeat> kuudes: what, just pay out dividends, no tax on that? 20% corporate tax and that's it? assuming you don't pay yourself salary, that is.
[10:54:51] <kuudes> the point is that elsewhere we don't have those "this generation is twice the size the next and previous generation"
[10:55:17] <kuudes> synthmeat, there is complex incentive structure, the tax is not 0% but you play with deductions and balance sheet etc

[10:55:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Russia had a horrific economic downturn in the 1990s, surging crime, alcoholism, etc., etc.
[10:56:05] <kuudes> yes it had
[10:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why does it surprise you that people stopped having as many kids
[10:56:11] <kuudes> they didn't
[10:56:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> They absolutely did
[10:56:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look at the fertility rates
[10:57:50] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, what do you feel causes there to have been many kids born in 1980?
[10:57:59] <kuudes> fertility rate in 1980 is lower than in 1975 in your chart

[10:59:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Because there's more people? Why is this surprising? Fertility rates have declined but the population hasn't started declining, therefore total births are still rising
[10:59:43] <kuudes> but 1975 had 2.03 tfr, 1980 had 1.94 tfr
[11:00:06] <kuudes> yes. there are more birthing women. that is the thing indeed
[11:00:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> No... there are more *people*
[11:00:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Period
[11:00:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just lag
[11:01:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Population decline is going to lag after fertility rate decline, after a period of increase - necessarily
[11:01:11] <kuudes> when people who were born in 2014, 1942683 of them, get to birthing age, there are more births than when people born in 2019, 1481074 of them get to birthing age

[11:02:26] <kuudes> also there were 30% more children born in 2014 than in 2003

[11:03:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: This absolutely proves that people in 2000 *were having fewer kids*.

[11:23:00] <kuudes> "The war set in motion an oscillating cycle of the annual number of births which continues to this day. A relatively small number of deaths in the postwar decades, due to the fact that a huge number of people killed during the war did not live to a normal age of death, created the illusion of a safe balance of births and deaths in the 1970’s-1980's. Cyclical fluctuations in the size of generations induced by the war resulted in a wave-like dynamics o

[11:25:00] <Robomot> PDF (44 pages; 829 KB) - The Demographic Echo of War and educational attainment in Soviet Russia (Gordey Yastrebov)
[11:25:50] <kuudes> "The total number of births dropped dramatically during the war (1941–1945) but, fueled by postponed fertility, quickly rebounded at the end of the 1940s. This led to the heaping  of  birth  cohorts  at  the  end  of  the  1940s  to  the  beginning  of  the  1950s  –  i.e., Russia’s  postwar  baby  boom.  From  then  on,  birthrates  in  Russia  evolved  largely  as  a result of two independent forces: (1) the second demographic transition, ca
[11:25:50] <kuudes> using a gradual secular decline in cohort fertility rates (the long dashed line in Figure 1), and (2) the sheer logic  of  numbers,  whereby  a  larger  generation  reproduced  a  larger  generation  and  a smaller generation reproduced a smaller generation, which the small changes in cohort fertility  rates  could  not  offset4  (Vishnevsky  2017). "
[11:27:02] <kuudes> "Although it would be unfair  to  claim  that  these  fluctuations  remained  completely  uninfluenced  by  various demographic policies (e.g., the abortion ban of 1936–1954, divorce liberalization in the 1960s,  family  support  measures  in  the  1980s;  for  an  overview  see  Vishnevsky  2006; Zakharov 2008), they do not seem to have achieved much in breaking down the cyclical nature of this pattern."
[11:27:14] <synthmeat> yeah, that's what we saw over here. decline during war, small bump up after (the "postponed" ones), then slow decline afterwards
[11:27:25] <kuudes> saturn2, there. it is an accepted theory in at least russian demographic science
[11:27:45] <kuudes> synthmeat, yeah, but in russia it still repeats over generations, because the effect there was so large
[11:27:57] <kuudes> elsewhere it indeed has already mostly smoothed
[11:28:20] <feep[work]> the driver still doesn't seem to be war deaths of women tho.
[11:28:23] <kuudes> but in russia there is this repeating pattern of "many births - few births - many - few - many"
[11:28:30] <kuudes> feep[work], that seems true
[11:29:07] <kuudes> but demographics in russia are anomalous in this sense, and many traditional shorthand measures like tfr estimates, get screwed by the population being abnormal
[11:29:44] <kuudes> with population, many things need to be estimates, because otherwise we can only deduce things from birth cohorts where everyone has already died
[11:29:53] <kuudes> so something like 100 years ago
[11:30:08] <kuudes> so we need to extrapolate, assume, presume, estimate etc
[11:30:16] <saturn2> kuudes: this paper doesn't seem to say the echo will last until 2075
[11:30:29] <kuudes> why would it say
[11:30:41] <kuudes> it is not the topic of the paper
[11:30:54] <kuudes> it is just making its own research points, outside of war echo
[11:31:18] <saturn2> that's the claim i find dubious
[11:31:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm reading about Vishnevsky (one of, or the, main authors of this theory) and I get the impression that his demographic views are rather ideologically driven...
[11:31:50] <kuudes> there are rather few demographists, so presumably there are large differences of opinions
[11:32:49] <kuudes> if about 1/million people are demographists, then there are 5 in finland, 330 in usa, 140 in russia. maybe it is 2-5 per million, but not likely 100 per million, I think
[11:32:50] <PlanckWalk> Large difference of opinion generally means (in the absence of ability to judge the evidence directly) weighting any one of them pretty low.
[11:33:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically this dude's thesis is that it's impossible to raise birth rate by any kind of government policy
[11:33:26] <kuudes> well, to an extent, yes
[11:33:51] <PlanckWalk> (And possibly weighting the combined space of their theories pretty lwo too)
[11:34:30] <kuudes> saturn2, hmm
[11:34:31] <saturn2> the graphs on page 62 seem to show that the magnitude of the echo shrinks significantly each time
[11:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Vishnevsky noted that the decline in the birth rate in Russia and Western Europe is taking place against the background of a demographic explosion in the world in general, which, as Vishnevsky believed, is a clear sign that humanity has mechanisms for self-regulation of its numbers. In his opinion, even if the population explosion stops by 2050, then it is necessary to survive until that time, and for this the increase must
[11:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus>  be somehow compensated [13] .
[11:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Since an increase in the birth rate is futile, there is only one way out for both Russia and the developed world - a controlled influx of population from the outside . Moreover, it will reduce the demographic pressure in the overpopulated “South” and compensate for the decline in population in the “North that is losing population” [13] . At the same time, Vishnevsky admits that the initial goal of accepting immigrants,
[11:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus>  who are cheap labor, is “profit for entrepreneurs” [13] ."

[11:36:43] <kuudes> ah, there
[11:36:57] <kuudes> yeah, it should get lesser over time. but 2 generations is not that much
[11:37:08] <kuudes> but yeah, in 2100s it likely will normalize
[11:37:22] <PlanckWalk> 2100s is more like 4 generations

[11:59:35] <kuudes> as the paper notes, demographics is often very political
[12:00:02] <kuudes> ussr manipulated its census often because it didn't like results
[12:01:37] <kuudes> "As is known, Stalin did not allow a census or at least a simplified population count of the USSR after the war, meaning this very important information about the war’s demographic results was irretrievably lost."
[12:08:21] <kuudes> I don't see why this seems so outlandish. clearly we can see the number of births to fluctuate.
[12:12:55] <kuudes> the problem is that in russia, science is not very free, and in rest of the world, the science is not very interested of russia
[12:15:50] <kuudes> apparently there might be no records on how many persons were born each year 1941-1945 in russia?

Starting a blog entails taking one very specific action, though: writing. And writing is really fucking hard.)
[12:22:55] <PapuaHardyNet> "If you found your significant other but still consistently miss doing important but not urgent things, you’re using your SO wrong."
[12:27:07] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: If you expect the census to be politically manipulated, shouldn't that *reduce* your credence for any theories based on it?
[12:32:10] <kuudes> https://i.imgur.com/eKOxRXn.png
[12:32:56] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, yes, but mostly to pro-political views of it
[12:33:23] <kuudes> saturn2, ^ waves are very visible in https://i.imgur.com/eKOxRXn.png when I tried to find out if the relative magnitude is getting smaller
[12:34:50] <kuudes> I guess if we are not pessimistic, wave magnitude could currently be 20% and was maybe 30% in the 1987 peak, so next one could then be 10% and the one after that finally could be about 0%?
[12:35:27] <kuudes> last peak was in 2014, and wavelength is about 31 years, so 2014 + 31 + 31 = 2076 could then be 0%
[12:35:49] <kuudes> but in 2014+31 = 2045 it should still be clearly noticeable at 10%
[12:36:32] <kuudes> but, as always with demographics, actually verifying things with observations takes decades.
[12:36:44] <kuudes> that is the problem with science related to very slow things
[12:40:30] <kuudes> could be shorter, maybe 28 year generations though, now that I look into the data
[12:43:00] <kuudes> I guess if you took a fourier transform of the births, it should light 28-31 years wavelength pretty bright and otherwise low?
[12:50:47] <feep[work]> 28-31 year wavelength, jesus
[12:50:52] <feep[work]> talk about ultra longwave
[12:52:14] <feep[work]> 30ly .. that's 9e-7 hz
[12:53:20] <kuudes> well, yes
[12:54:25] <kuudes> but I don't get it why you guys would want to explain those waves by there being some sort of cyclical politics in russia
[12:54:48] <kuudes> that feels much weirder than there just being this many people in these birth cohorts and rest following from that
[12:55:25] <feep[work]> a being whose brain ran at that frequency, assuming ours is 1khz, would experience the universe to be 12 years old.

[13:02:11] <saturn2> i don't think there's cyclical politics, i think politics in the 1990s coincidentally made the wave appear not to be shrinking
[13:02:51] <kuudes> well, the waves could plausibly cause some politics, I think
[13:03:21] <kuudes> as noted, when the birth cohort is heading to smaller, schools and hospitals sort of "get larger" and life gets easier
[13:03:34] <kuudes> and the other way around when birth cohorts get larger
[13:04:28] <saturn2> interesting
[13:04:47] <PapuaHardyNet> oh my god
[13:04:56] <PapuaHardyNet> Action Button just released his Cyberpunk 2077 video
[13:05:17] <saturn2> that's the opposite of what economists usually say, isn't it?
[13:05:29] <kuudes> is it?
[13:05:33] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, why is it just one hour? his videos are regularly over four hours
[13:05:53] <kuudes> on long term crunch I guess things get harder eventually, but on short term more resources per child seem better
[13:06:31] <kuudes> if there are 2000 persons competing for 100 spots in university, it seems harder than if there are 1000 persons and 100 spots
[13:06:42] <kuudes> but the university is more expensive for the society though
[13:07:00] <kuudes> so society level things are harder but person level they are easier, or something?
[13:10:02] <saturn2> baby boomers in the US are sort of notorious for having easy lives
[13:13:11] <kuudes> why?
[13:15:06] <capisce> "Born in the postwar period, baby boomers reaped the advantages of free education, thriving industry, stable jobs and affordable homes."
[13:17:30] <capisce> "Boomers lived in a world where there was protection, and jobs were kept in the country."

[13:18:54] <capisce> oh, this seems to be talking about boomers in nz
[13:19:48] <saturn2> these don't seem like very good explanations
[13:21:30] <kuudes> in usa the racial segregation is another thing that confuses stuff
[13:21:56] <kuudes> that sort of ended in 1970s but still last in some form to 1990s I guess
[13:22:34] <kuudes> so white baby boomers still lived in segregated society, so maybe they had more transfers from black population than later people?

[13:40:34] <kuudes> saturn2, basicly just that white boomers would have had fewer people to divide their societal resources with if they didn't have to divide them with black boomers, but white millenials might have more people they need to divide stuff with if they have to divide them with black millennials
[13:40:44] <kuudes> ie university intake etc
[13:41:20] <kuudes> but I don't know the data so I am uncertain
[13:54:09] <saturn2> if you refuse to sell a house to the highest bidder because they are black, and sell it to a lower bidder instead, yes you have destroyed some of your own wealth

[13:54:28] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: 3 peaks is extremely weak evidence of any sort of cycle
[13:55:31] <rsaarelm> Man I spent so long looking at the backlog trying to figure out wth was going on with the fertility theory until people started going about 30 year wavelengths and then it clicked.
[13:55:48] <PlanckWalk> The first is just a peak.  The second could happen any time, so is also zero evidence of a cycle.  The third is kinda-sorta evidence, but is easily coincidence
[13:56:37] <PlanckWalk> So it's really only after 4 clear peaks of fairly equal spacing and consistent magnitude that you can seriously consider a cycle hypothesis
[13:56:58] <PlanckWalk> (and if you're cherry-pickign countries, at least 5)
[13:57:36] <synthmeat> it's maybe not entirely unreasonable to assume cycles by default for something that's a social trend
[13:57:47] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, there are lots of countries, so maybe 6
[13:58:04] <PlanckWalk> synthmeat: It's pretty unreasonable when it doesn't show up in every other country
[13:58:59] <PlanckWalk> Like, there's already 4 free parameters here, you need pretty darn strong data to rule out spurious fit.
[13:59:19] <saturn2> also labor unions quickly found that maintaining segregation was very costly for them, as it created a ready-made scab force
[14:04:04] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, propose a bet?
[14:05:32] <PlanckWalk> On what?
[14:06:16] <PapuaHardyNet> okay action button released 9 hours worth of footage for his Cyberpunk 2077 review
[14:06:19] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah
[14:07:02] <PlanckWalk> I'm not saying "it's false", I'm saying "your credence that it's true should be not much more than your prior"
[14:12:15] <kuudes> the dips are 1917, 1943, 1968 and 1999
[14:12:19] <kuudes> 4 dips
[14:12:48] <kuudes> presumably next bottom is around 2030
[14:13:17] <kuudes> 26 years, 25 years, 31 years between the 4 bottoms
[14:14:10] <kuudes> and yes, your point is of course valid. there needs to be a lot of evidence for many things
[14:14:25] <kuudes> but as we know, gathering that evidence takes longer than we will live.
[14:14:45] <kuudes> so I guess the option is then to either to default "we can't know anything about the matter" or make presumptions
[14:15:28] <kuudes> so to me the thing that confirms enough for update is the birth cohort size increase in russia between 1999 and 2014
[14:15:44] <PlanckWalk> What do you mean "confirms enough for update"?
[14:15:54] <kuudes> to presume true
[14:15:57] <PlanckWalk> You mean moving it from "baseline prior" to "just above baseline prior?"
[14:16:20] <PlanckWalk> Oh, "presumed true" is *way* more strong than I expected.
[14:16:40] <kuudes> this is why betting would be useful. we would see the actual numbers behind the beliefs
[14:17:19] <kuudes> I would bet 67% belief that in year 2040 birth cohort size is larger in russia than it was there in year 2030
[14:17:42] <PlanckWalk> Eh, not much.  The overheads of betting are way larger than any linear payoff is likely to be.
[14:17:47] <kuudes> yes.
[14:18:25] <kuudes> truly uninformed prior would be 50%
[14:18:33] <PlanckWalk> Wouldn't you rather bet that it will be larger in 2040 than both 2030 and 2050?
[14:18:40] <kuudes> no
[14:18:46] <kuudes> 2050 is not a dip
[14:18:54] <kuudes> wavelength could easily change by some years
[14:18:58] <PlanckWalk> When do you think the peak will be?
[14:19:26] <kuudes> last peak was in 2014, so about +30 years from that, so around 2045
[14:20:09] <PlanckWalk> Ugh, variable wavelength adds more free parameters still
[14:20:13] <kuudes> if we want to smooth the waves, we should encourage randomization of age at first birth I suppose
[14:20:21] <kuudes> which seems quite nontrivial
[14:20:30] <kuudes> yes
[14:20:45] <kuudes> but the point I believe is that waving exists in this.
[14:20:52] <kuudes> and that seems to me quite clear
[14:21:02] <kuudes> but apparently clearly false to some others
[14:22:04] <kuudes> saturn2, notice the coincidence to russia's politics, 1999 and 2014 are more known for other reasons than population bottoms and peaks :)
[14:22:41] <kuudes> but I agree not too much should be read into it. there is danger of overfitting
[14:22:56] <PlanckWalk> Well, we're up to at least 5 free parameters now, perhaps more.
[14:23:08] <PlanckWalk> Its already looking like overfitting :-p
[14:24:28] <kuudes> the prediction seems rather low parameter though? "birth cohort size aside random errors will keep lowering for years and then turn to increasing over years for at least 10 years"
[14:25:56] <kuudes> "after sum of three last year births turn to increase, it will not turn to decrease before at least 10 years have passed"
[14:27:29] <PlanckWalk> But ... that's also true of many non-periodic variations
[14:27:56] <kuudes> "there are fewer births in Russia in 2037 than there are in 2040" sounds pretty specific and judgeable
[14:28:27] <PlanckWalk> It's also only 1 bit of information, which can also be satisfied by non-periodic trends
[14:28:35] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, sure, but it is much less true if one presumes there is only about constant changes
[14:28:46] <PlanckWalk> So I wouldn't put more than 50% against it.
[14:29:12] <kuudes> sure
[14:29:16] <PlanckWalk> It's a way weaker claim than the actual model being tested
[14:29:35] <kuudes> generally yes. predictions require much less bits than narratives
[14:29:47] <kuudes> which is why we should talk about predictions, usually
[14:30:33] <kuudes> and if you hold it 50% likely "there are fewer births in Russia in 2037 than there are in 2040" will be untrue and I hold it only 33% likely, then we indeed have difference in priors
[14:31:24] <kuudes> or well, "there are fewer births in Russia in 2037 than there are in 2040" is true statement in 2045, PlanckWalk 50%, kuudes 67%?
[14:31:49] <kuudes> but yes, future is far away
[14:32:17] <kuudes> similar sort of thing happens in predicting on if humans can ever live over 130 or not
[14:32:55] <kuudes> falsification of that will take to beyong 2100
[14:33:00] <PlanckWalk> I'm not even sure that I'd put that as low as 50%
[14:33:33] <kuudes> how likely you see "there are fewer births in Russia in 2037 than there are in 2040" is true?
[14:34:29] <kuudes> saturn2, do you have an opinion about that statement btw?
[14:35:51] <kuudes> hmm. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/26/economy/musk-world-hunger-wfp-intl/index.html
[14:35:52] <Robomot> 2% of Elon Musk's wealth could solve world hunger, says director of UN food scarcity organization  - CNN (A small group of ultra-wealthy individuals could help solve world hunger with just a fraction of their net worth, says the director of the United Nations' World Food Programme. …)
[14:36:34] <PlanckWalk> Lots of modern countries have declining birthrates, so probably mroe than 50%
[14:36:47] <kuudes> I would like Musk to make a bet  with WFP where he pays them $12 billion now and expects them to pay him $24 billion in 2032 if there still exists hunger in the world
[14:37:06] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, that statement is about increasing birth amounts
[14:37:19] <kuudes> 2040 has more births, 2037 less births"
[14:37:47] <kuudes> so you would believe it unlikely that happens? ie <50%?
[14:38:00] <kuudes> then good, now we are nearing a crux
[14:40:18] <PlanckWalk> AHokay, yeah I had those reversed.
[14:40:31] <PlanckWalk> Then yes, I'd say a bit under 50%

[14:57:40] <Gurkenglas> Improvising more D&D Theology. Petitioners, the ghosts of the dead, lose their identity over time; they keep the forgetfulness of mortals, but can't form new memories. Petitioners stabilize when their personalities become simple enough. Pharasma sorts them into the afterlife that will stabilize them with the least damage.
[14:59:06] <Gurkenglas> Hell specializes in lawful evil souls: It subjects petitioners to the illusion that everyone else that they care about is suffering. They are thus incentivized (and Asmodeus is the god of incentives, and therefore the best at setting up incentive structures) to forget that they care about another person, because then the illusion will stop hurting. If they care about the real version but not the illusion, 
[14:59:06] <Gurkenglas> that's good enough: Devils remember this as caring about someone because of their effects on the world - because of their use.
[14:59:58] <rsaarelm> Gurkenglas: So what are stabilized dead souls like? This is D&D, so they should be some monster type, right?
[15:00:03] <Gurkenglas> Yeah, outsiders.
[15:00:18] <Gurkenglas> That's where outsiders come from.
[15:00:46] <rsaarelm> So angels, devils and whatnot all evolve from dead mortals?
[15:00:50] <Gurkenglas> Yep.
[15:00:53] <rsaarelm> Right.
[15:01:30] <Gurkenglas> Well, wishes and gods can produce them from whole cloth, but it's not cheap. That's what happens when you wish an outsider back to life. Works for outsiders but not for mortals, because their personalities are simple enough.
[15:03:07] <rsaarelm> Standard fantasy cosmologies have a weird blind spot for hell as the realm of the dead. Your usual Warhammer, Might & Magic or what have you has demons from hell as these zerg-like aliens with the occasional brimstone, goatee and pitchfork trappings, while the undead just naturally pop up on the prime material plane or are raised by necromancers.
[15:03:20] <kuudes> saturn2, indeed. population predictions are slow
[15:03:41] <synthmeat> wait, when did people start hating on chomsky?
[15:04:00] <rsaarelm> Planescapey D&D gets a bit more into the afterlife stuff, but doesn't tie that strongly into the dungeon crawling mainstream D&D that has zerg devils and skeletons raised by necromancers again.

This particular task requires Asmodeus to gather all the power, because in the long run the CR that crawls out of the Abyss is unbounded.

[15:35:26] <PapuaHardyNet> the way you enjoy talking about lore, especially the way you hint at how much you enjoy well crafted fantasy lore, prompted my brain to remind myself of how much I loved the series
[15:36:06] <PapuaHardyNet> it is low fantasy, unfortunately. More ASoIaF than W40k, but that's what came to mind at that moment
[15:36:25] <Gurkenglas> Your XP, the worth of your soul, measures the amount of attention that the gods pay to you. Kill lots of monsters and the attention paid to your quarry often transfers to you. If you summon monsters and then kill them in some basement, that doesn't do anything.
[15:38:08] <rsaarelm> I liked Abercrombie's First Law trilogy which was pretty straightforward pulp so dunno, could like that too.
[15:40:36] <Gurkenglas> (Every decision theory, of course, (...I think...), can be equivalently represented as the extent to which you care about the events in every past and future timeline. So actually your entire alignment, your what-needs-to-become-simple-enough-to-stabilize, is just what you care about.)
[15:42:32] <Gurkenglas> So while petitioners do lose memories over time, getting them to lose their caring first stabilizes them the easiest.

[15:49:40] <Gurkenglas> Nethys can see all the timelines and can therefore pay his god-rent by selling information to the other gods instead of through worship. He appreciates and invests in powerful spellcasters because worlds containing them are harder to model for your average god, increasing his customer base.
[15:54:12] <Gurkenglas> Paying attention to someone you don't like does make them more powerful, but being able to plan against them tends to be worth it.
[15:57:18] <Gurkenglas> *Everyone* paying attention to demons is *not* worth the increase in their power; it's what they use to leave the Abyss in the first place, barring spacetime rifts. Sadly the parts of gods that decide what to pay attention to is legacy code, and it's hard to introduce a new standard when so many of the gods are chaotic and won't subscribe to software updates.

[16:02:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm glad to hear that!
[16:06:23] <Gurkenglas> The gods originally introduced PageRank for their currency because it's easy to specify, looks fair and is hard to cheat. They thought. Later one noticed that tiny agents that do things and love their creator count as nodes.
[16:07:51] <Gurkenglas> (Mortals are *very* cheap to create if you don't specify what they care about.)
[16:10:39] <RiversHaveWings> pagerank but acausal and determines your measure
[16:13:21] <nshepperd2> what's SEO for existence
[16:14:50] <Gurkenglas> The Old Gods are the ones that had the hardest time switching to the new meta. They knew they wouldn't get a stable population in the world as it looked then, so they set some longterm plots into motion and hid in the far reaches of the (exponentially large, so easy to hide in; stable, so possible to come back from after a long time) Maelstrom
[16:15:42] <Gurkenglas> The other gods were happy to stop paying attention to them, and so didn't investigate many of their plots.
[16:16:51] <Gurkenglas> (ha, "paying" attention)
[16:25:39] <Gurkenglas> The flaw in the PageRank system is: Creating an entity aligned to you costs about as much as it is worth; but when you don't specify its goals and then it "happens" to learn to worship you, that's free lunch. It didn't occur to them that when you make an agent tiny enough, it stops being reflectively stable before it stops doing things that draw attention; and then if you give it a material body *that* erodes 
[16:25:39] <Gurkenglas> instead of the inconsistent soul.
[16:28:51] <RiversHaveWings> i think pagerank is harder to game if you don't have a damping factor and you require there to be outbound connections from every node
[16:29:10] <RiversHaveWings> like you could penalize nodes for not having outbound connections by not including them in the graph or smth.
[16:29:47] <Gurkenglas> A node that pays attention to nothing doesn't do anything and so there's no reason for anyone else to pay attention to it.
[16:30:12] <RiversHaveWings> ofc then you wouldn't be able to use it to rank webpages but as a "currency" it might work better than standard pagerank?
[16:32:27] <RiversHaveWings> like the damping factor works as "redistribution" of the "currency" and that's why you can still sybil attack it if you have enough resources
[16:34:25] <RiversHaveWings> also with no damping factor you can end up with more than one connected component so you have to manually specify the one you're interested in, like by picking the component that includes a designated node.
[16:35:02] <Gurkenglas> You don't have to specify the connected component. There can just be multiple, and it's the GM and players that decide which component they're looking at.
[16:35:43] <Gurkenglas> Just like you don't have to collapse Many-Worlds to Copenhagen.
[16:37:04] <Gurkenglas> Even they could tell that "redistribute currency among all players over time" is a bad idea when everyone can make more players.
[16:37:05] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: if you don't specify you don't get a unique solution
[16:37:49] <Gurkenglas> RiversHaveWings, indeed, they don't have a unique solution. They're doing iterative PageRank, that's what time is.
[16:38:25] <RiversHaveWings> with that method the solution will depend on the initial distribution
[16:38:29] <Gurkenglas> Correct!
[16:38:47] <Gurkenglas> They had an initial distribution and decided to switch to PageRank, starting where they currently were.
[16:38:50] <RiversHaveWings> Oh
[16:38:52] <RiversHaveWings> OK
[16:39:14] <Gurkenglas> They preferred that to the previous system, where gods would just eat other gods to take their power.
[16:39:54] <Gurkenglas> (You can see where that goes in Abaddon.)
[16:41:45] <RiversHaveWings> so if you have multiple connected components then the ratios of the total rankings within each component has to stay the same as the ratios of the total rankings in the initial distribution
[16:42:11] <Gurkenglas> Every connected component has constant-over-time total currency, yes.

[17:06:58] <Gurkenglas> How did he invent Foresight? The tinyness needed to allow reflective inconsistency also allows mortals to pick other axioms. The gods don't know this in full detail, but: Nethys learned that the gods model the world using ZFC+some large cardinal axioms, *guessed* at some larger cardinal axiom (luckily correctly), and built a proof oracle that can predict the gods.

[17:17:19] <Gurkenglas> Correctly in the sense that even the existence of that large a cardinal doesn't let you prove false. It, uh, would be bad for the gods to hook inconsistent axioms into the feature of reality that runs them. Reality already didn't accept axiom systems that it *proved* were inconsistent, but after Nethys' ascension the gods constructed Otolmens to make sure nobody gambles with that interface again.
[17:28:32] <Gurkenglas> Nethys revealed that the previous planar setup would inevitably converge into an unusable attractor state, which is why they moved to the current setup. The elemental, positive and negative energy planes are the remnants of the previous setup.

In other words, I started to think this whole theory might have nothing to do with reality.

[19:44:21] <two2thehead> "Theory of mind in naturalistic conversations between autistic and typically developing children and adolescents"
[19:44:35] <two2thehead> "Successful social interactions are assumed to depend on theory of mind (ToM)—the ability to represent others’ mental states—yet most studies of the relation between ToM and social-interactive success rely on non-interactive tasks that do not adequately capture the spontaneous engagement of ToM, a crucial component of everyday social interactions. We addressed this gap by establishing a novel observational rating scale to measur
[19:44:35] <two2thehead> e the spontaneous use of ToM (or lack thereof) within naturalistic conversations (conversational ToM, or cToM). In 50 age- and gender-matched dyads of autistic and typically developing children aged 8–16, we assessed cToM during 5-minute, unstructured conversations. We found that ratings on the cToM Negative scale, reflecting ToM-related violations of conversational norms, were negatively associated with two forms of non-interactive ToM
[19:44:35] <two2thehead> : visual-affective and spontaneous. In contrast, the cToM Positive scale, reflecting explicit mental state language and perspective-taking, was not associated with these non-interactive ToM abilities. Furthermore, autistic participants were rated higher than typically developing participants on cToM Negative, but the two groups were rated similarly on cToM Positive. Together, these findings provide insight into multiple aspects of ToM in 
[19:44:42] <two2thehead> conversation and reveal a nuanced picture of the relative strengths and difficulties among autistic individuals."

[21:56:31] <feepbot> <gwern> 'our biological ancestors were distributed everywhere from Morocco to the Cape of Good Hope. Some of those populations remained isolated from one another for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, cut off from their nearest relatives by deserts and rainforests. Strong regional traits developed, so that early human populations appear to have been far more physically
[21:56:31] <feepbot> diverse than modern humans. If we could travel back in time, this remote past would probably strike us as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants and elves than anything we have direct experience of today, or in the more recent past....What we do know is that we are composite products of this original mosaic of human populations, which interacted with one
[21:56:31] <feepbot> another, interbred, drifted apart and came together mostly in ways we can only still guess at. It seems reasonable to assume that behaviours like mating and child-rearing practices, the presence or absence of dominance hierarchies or forms of language and proto-language must have varied at least as much as physical types, and probably far more...What all this brings home is just
[21:56:36] <feepbot> how radically different the social and physical world of our remote ancestors would have seemed to us – and this would have been true at least down to about 40,000BC. In other words, there is no “original” form of human society. Searching for one can only be a matter of myth-making.'

He said the four passengers didn’t notice anything was wrong during the
[22:28:46] <feepbot> mission. “We didn’t really even notice it, the crew didn’t even notice it, until we got back,” Mr. Gerstenmaier said. “When we got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor and saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor of Inspiration4.” SpaceX completed a fix for the toilet aboard the capsule being used for Sunday’s launch.
