[10:51:55] <iamak[m]> Is there a good program to help configure fonts on Arch? Manually doing it is confusing me
[10:51:57] <iamak[m]> ;_;
[10:52:14] <AryaK[m]> fc-cache -fv
[10:52:21] <AryaK[m]> and fontpreview-ueberzug
[10:52:50] <theo[m]> iamak[m]: configure fonts?
[10:52:50] <theo[m]> just mv the fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts or /usr/share/fonts lol
[10:52:58] <theo[m]> AryaK[m]: this
[10:52:58] <theo[m]> or gnome-font-viewer
[10:53:10] <theo[m]> AryaK[m]: what does it do?
[10:53:13] <iamak[m]> > <@telegram_1371655671:t2bot.io> configure fonts?
[10:53:13] <iamak[m]> > just mv the fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts or /usr/share/fonts lol
[10:53:13] <iamak[m]> Yes but the order matters na
[10:53:26] <theo[m]> iamak[m]: what order?
[10:53:26] <theo[m]> i dont get itðŸ˜…
[10:53:55] <iamak[m]> If Fira Code is above Awesome fonts, Fira code takes priority
[10:53:58] <AryaK[m]> theo[m]: refresh font database
[10:54:09] <AryaK[m]> ie. makes sure system knows new fonts exist
[10:54:53] <theo[m]> AryaK[m]: thinking emoji
[10:54:53] <theo[m]> i think it happens for me automatically without having to refresh cache
[10:54:53] <theo[m]> fonts show up in lxappearance, libreoffice instantaneously
[10:55:13] <AryaK[m]> maybe gnome-font thing does it automatically idk
[10:56:35] <theo[m]> AryaK[m]: it doesnt run in the background or anything
[10:56:35] <theo[m]> i use bspwm, man
[11:00:07] <iamak[m]> <AryaK[m]> "and fontpreview-ueberzug" <- This only works for english letters? No emojis?
[11:00:48] <AryaK[m]> gnome font viewer should work for emojis
[11:00:54] <iamak[m]> Ok
[11:16:12] <iamak[m]> Does anyone game on Linux here?
[11:18:25] <AryaK[m]> yes
[11:18:33] <AryaK[m]> i play xonotic minetest supertuxkart and redeclipse
[11:19:53] <iamak[m]> Are they Linux native games?
[11:19:58] <AryaK[m]> yes
[11:20:03] <AryaK[m]> and all are libre
[11:20:04] <iamak[m]> Apart from SuperTux haven't heard of any
[11:20:10] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: Ah
[11:20:20] <iamak[m]> I was thinking more like Steam/etc games
[11:20:46] <AryaK[m]> i have played csgo back then
[11:20:52] *** Joins: vnf (~vnf@46.159.151.228)
[11:20:52] <AryaK[m]> but i dont play it nowadays
[11:20:56] <iamak[m]> Achha
[11:21:30] <iamak[m]> I was thinking of building a PC and installing only linux. But I am building it to mostly play games so I wanted to be sure that I don't need windows
[11:22:25] <labrador> I don't play any games but its just better to dualboot windows at this point
[11:22:39] <labrador> Retrofitting an OS to run another's api is no joke
[11:23:16] <iamak[m]> Ik but it will be 256 GB SSD so difficult to dual boot :/
[11:23:22] <iamak[m]> Games take lot of space
[11:24:57] <iamak[m]> labrador: Yeah ik. But from my exp, most games on steam "just run" on Linux. But my exp is very small so wanted other opinions
[11:25:24] <AryaK[m]> isnt cod like 256 gb
[11:25:33] <labrador> iamak[m], also another thing
[11:25:49] <labrador> Whats the point of runnin the linux kernel...then injecting a blob into it
[11:25:59] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: TIL
[11:26:04] <labrador> And not a firmware blob thats inherently harmless
[11:26:12] <labrador> But a blob designed to monitor
[11:26:19] <labrador> Seems like a recipe for disaster
[11:26:22] <iamak[m]> Which blob?
[11:26:30] <daksh[m]> hi
[11:26:40] <daksh[m]> AryaK[m]: c*d
[11:27:06] <labrador> iamak[m], anticheat systems
[11:27:19] <iamak[m]> I usually play solo games
[11:27:23] <iamak[m]> So no anticheat
[11:27:30] <labrador> hmm
[11:28:00] <labrador> iamak[m], you could see the protondb
[11:28:10] <labrador> If they're platinum or gold you're golden(hehe)
[11:28:41] <daksh[m]> labrador: anti cheat isnt a kernel lvl thing is it
[11:28:43] <daksh[m]> and customizability
[11:28:51] <daksh[m]> and many part of it is still fre
[11:28:53] <daksh[m]> s/fre/free/
[11:28:54] <iamak[m]> Yeah I already checked protondb. I just wanted personal exps
[11:28:58] <iamak[m]> daksh[m]: It is
[11:29:03] <daksh[m]> you are still supporting fs movement
[11:29:09] <daksh[m]>  * and customizability is a choice
[11:29:17] <daksh[m]> iamak[m]: peta cringe
[11:29:33] <daksh[m]> play xonotic and and stk 
[11:30:08] <labrador> daksh[m], anti cheat runs at ring 0 of the processor
[11:30:27] <daksh[m]> how does that affect
[11:30:36] <daksh[m]> (im not sure, just asking)
[11:30:46] <AryaK[m]> that means it has access to everything
[11:30:48] <labrador> daksh[m], it can access whatever a kernel can
[11:30:53] <labrador> aka anything
[11:30:54] <daksh[m]> ok but
[11:30:57] <daksh[m]> customizability
[11:30:58] <AryaK[m]> searx what is ring0
[11:31:13] <labrador> daksh[m], how's that customizability?
[11:31:13] <daksh[m]> you may want your sway config
[11:31:22] <labrador> in ring 0?

[11:31:39] <AryaK[m]> daksh[m]: what
[11:31:42] <iamak[m]> labrador: He means that using Linux (instead of windows) will give customizability
[11:32:08] <labrador> iamak[m], and what I'm saying is it isn't a better idea to run a blob in a free kernel than running a nonfree kernel itself
[11:32:10] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: TIL wow
[11:32:20] <labrador> Cost/benefit analysis
[11:32:22] <labrador> iamak[m], also
[11:32:37] <iamak[m]> labrador: Yeah but I mostly play solo games so not an issue for me
[11:32:50] <iamak[m]> Also won't games require sudo access to run kernel level anticheat?
[11:32:53] <labrador> LEarn about interrupts,syscalls
[11:32:53] <iamak[m]> Or no?
[11:33:03] <labrador> iamak[m], they don't
[11:33:11] <labrador> The ring 0 access is different from sudo
[11:33:19] <labrador> One is enforced by the processor
[11:33:23] <labrador> The other by the kernel
[11:33:34] <labrador> Once given ring 0 access,your code IS PART OF THE KERNEL
[11:34:06] <labrador> No context switches are needed to run that code when its ring 0
[11:34:12] <labrador> make sense?
[11:34:47] <iamak[m]> Achha
[11:35:11] <daksh[m]> AryaK[m]: like
[11:35:11] <theo[m]> <labrador> "I don't play any games but its..." <- well, i'd go for gpu passthrough if i had the resources
[11:35:25] <daksh[m]> you may want specific software
[11:35:29] <daksh[m]> only on linux
[11:35:33] <daksh[m]>  * only on gnu linux
[11:35:50] <daksh[m]> you cant get sway i3 gnome on windows, obv
[11:35:55] <labrador> theo[m], can't run a vm
[11:35:59] <daksh[m]> i mea it nthat way
[11:36:02] <daksh[m]>  * i mean it that way
[11:36:52] <theo[m]> labrador: oh
[11:36:52] <theo[m]> then dualboot is the way to go
