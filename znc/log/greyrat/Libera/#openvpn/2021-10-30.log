[01:41:58] <emOne> I am confused
[01:42:04] <emOne> I just installed openVPN on my VPS
[01:42:17] <emOne> and I can connect to it but I didn't open the port though 
[01:42:35] <emOne> how is this possible? 
[01:43:04] <emOne> I installed it using this method here -> https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-setup-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-linux-14-04-or-16-04-lts/

[01:57:55] <BtbN> "Opened the port"?
[01:58:10] <BtbN> Don't servers usually get a public IP?
[02:21:37] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[02:35:31] <emOne> BtbN: yes sure but the server is using iptables as a firewall
[02:35:45] <emOne> I am not so sure how I can connect to the vpn server
[02:35:58] <BtbN> iptables defaults to doing literally nothing
[02:36:06] <BtbN> so unless you explicitly made it block stuff, there's nothing to open
[02:46:06] <emOne> I think my iptables do block things
[02:46:17] <emOne> but I am guessing that the .sh script adds an exception 
[02:46:19] <emOne> who knows
[02:46:23] <emOne> it works 
[02:50:17] <BtbN> the .sh script?
[02:50:28] <BtbN> And unless you explicitly configured iptables to block stuff, it really doesn't.
[02:53:22] <emOne> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
[02:54:01] <emOne> I am running some sort of web panel that configures iptable to block ports by default as far as I can tell
[02:54:48] <rob0> I don't think that script would be something I'd recommend.
[02:55:10] <emOne> rob0: hmm yea I think it has messed with my iptables
[02:55:11] <rob0> I would suggest instead using the official HOWTO.
[03:04:42] <emOne> what does it mean if nmap doesn't find an open port for the port that openVPN is on? 
[03:04:54] <emOne> how am I still connecting to it?
[03:06:56] <emOne> brb
