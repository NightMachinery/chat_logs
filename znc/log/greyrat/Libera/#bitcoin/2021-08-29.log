[17:55:04] <whiterose> logically a wallet should connect to the closest and fastest node not some random one in Singapore
[17:57:40] <whiterose> when you begin syncing the chain it on a node in France it should not connect to nodes in the USA when there are closer ones with much better speed
[17:58:37] <whiterose> randomly connecting to long distance nodes seriously hurt the network
[17:59:10] <whiterose> no to mention if the node doesn't even synced fully

[18:45:46] <whiterose> you know what is absurd Alver?
[18:45:59] <whiterose> dnsseed in Bitcoin core
[18:46:50] <whiterose> censorship resistant? certainly not.
[18:48:17] <whiterose> better to have a few full node which is fast in a country where censorship is out of question than rely on honky-dory dnsseeds to tell you which nodes to use
[18:49:54] <whiterose> "Bitcoin Core attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds, but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network. As such, DNS seeds must be run by entities which have some minimum level of trust within the Bitcoin community."
[18:50:21] <whiterose> I don't trust any dnsseed shipped in Bitcoin Core, now what?

[18:55:23] <whiterose> the problem is that by default all users use the hardcoded dnsseeds and the end-user will not going to mess with the configuration manually
[18:56:32] <whiterose> how we can be certain that they not forcing on us nodes with malicious intent?
[18:56:45] <gribble> that's a smaller problem than having no seeds at all
[18:57:19] <gribble> you're already running the code on your machine.. that's a much bigger threat than the seed nodes

[19:07:26] <whiterose> bandwidth is the main reason yes, and I certainly don't want to run full node behind Tor which even more slow, so I have dedicated IP with a link speed of 1000Mbps connection
[19:09:08] <whiterose> it would be almost funny if a node with 0.1 Mbps in the USA is preferred over my node when lets say when an Icelandic users which to broadcast its transaction

[19:10:40] <whiterose> immediately attacking China, look at that
[19:14:14] <whiterose> I don't see any problem with having Chinese nodes serving Chinese users, I invested a lot of money into this one node in Iceland because as I said it is midway between USA and EU it will provide the most stable and fastest connection for both continent.

[19:15:08] <whiterose> Halifax: 33.7ms
[19:15:31] <whiterose> average
[19:21:01] <whiterose> For matter of fact Iceland should have more nodes than it has now, Iceland is the most secure country for hosting data, logs from nodes in the USA pretty easily can be seized by the FBI if the really want to, same in Europe. The logging of access to these nodes is more concerning than the speed of the nodes in question.
[19:23:02] <whiterose> running a full node behind tor has no meaning to the network, you can't expect anyone to sync 360 GB data over tor, they only designed to have some private auth to RPC nothing more

[20:38:51] <whiterose> Silkroad was truly amazing, there is nothing today, not even nice trustworthy mixers, everyone jailed. Feels like innovation just stopped. This happens when everyone who has good visions, the brains, locked up in jail.

[22:16:17] <whiterose> you can't run an old version of bitcoind which is exactly what they wanted, forcing users to upgrade the client while pushing for major changes in the software, as a result only a handful of nodes can work today, basically destroying all nodes by forcing them to constantly upgrade to a new shit what proposed by the same people over and over for years to promote for profit corporations like those by Adam Black, Blockstream Inc which
[22:16:17] <whiterose> wanna seed blocks from satellites in Syria and Iran.

[22:21:10] <whiterose> This is a major issue and can result in a chain split! You can't force thousands of nodes to upgrade to your version constantly, even worse, if the client not upgrade it will be killed by the upgrade, a normal developer who has any experience in developing software would make sure backward compatibility. Splitting the chain can occur at any moment, especially if the public decides to abandon the current developers.
[22:25:29] <whiterose> All bitcoind version back to Bitcoin 0.1.1 should be compatible! The current developers by each upgrade (forced one I may add) risking splitting the chain! Splitting the chain can be initiated by anyone who begins distributing a lower version of the software by any moment now! The last few years the Bitcoin source code brutally trolled multiple times by for-profit corporations and they employees. I believe a chain split is imminent.

[22:28:58] <Ara> I don't think anyone cares what you do
[22:31:53] <whiterose> Oh they do, they are afraid only one thing. Splitting the chain. I will split the chain not just one time but 3 times, going in reverse and removing all segwit and other crap from the source code before we can begin to increase the version number again. Only by multiple chain split we can get rid of the current crap what merged to Bitcoin since 2017 on average about every 6-12 months
[22:32:47] <Ara> People with more money, influence, and a clue than you have tried. Why would anyone run your crappy fork?
[22:33:21] <whiterose> this is a chain split not a "fork"
[22:33:38] <whiterose> they are different things

[22:38:45] <whiterose> the question should be, why we should run the current Bitcoin Core?
[22:39:23] <whiterose> is there any core really? or just a bunch of heads claim to be?
[22:39:40] <Ara> Because it wasn't made by a clueless rube like you?

[22:43:11] <Ara> Why are you always wasting your time in here? There are only ~400 people in here. Don't you have a crappy bitcoin forum to be running?
[22:45:10] <whiterose> you don't wanna see that before the show
[22:49:38] <whiterose> the main losers will be you know the Blockstream guys, the BTC Inc, and other American scammers like Saylor who promoted himself to be Jesus in less than a year... Bitcoin today is all that, which the old Bitcoin stood against. Corporate America not only started to accumulate it, but also manipulate it and force changes in its core. Satoshi Nakamoto is disgraced and I'm his messenger. the party is soon over just wait a few days more.
