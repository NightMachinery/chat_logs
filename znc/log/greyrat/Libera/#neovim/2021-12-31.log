[01:37:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> `:e` is also part of the assumption you were using treesitter
[01:37:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> see, it's an issue with bug reports being done via screenshots

[01:42:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> yep
[01:42:49] <the-repo-club[m]> cheers ðŸ™‚
[01:43:06] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can see _most_ of the bash specific hl groups with `:hl bash<Tab>`
[01:43:23] <sunjonSenghanBri> and map those to whatever you like in your colorscheme
[01:43:49] <the-repo-club[m]> thanks that helped a ton ðŸ™‚ it was driving me nuts having broken syntax
[01:43:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> ooof
[01:44:37] <clason[m]> (note that those `bashFoo` highlight groups are not the ones used by tree-sitter...)
[01:44:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> I was just about to correct that :]
[01:44:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground
[01:45:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> use TSPlayground to see what your new hl-groups are
[01:45:25] <sunjonSenghanBri> then use the old hl-groups to get things relatively back to normal
[01:45:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think treesitter will actually provide slightly more detailed highglighting (generally), it might map one to one for bash

[09:57:37] <dre> [closed] nvm solved it 
[09:58:29] <dre> mjlbach[m], do you think that the choice of lua being the extensible language for neovim is a mistake and we instead should have gone for common lisp instead?

[10:17:13] <numToStr[m]> Why do you think lua in neovim is a mistake? 
[10:20:49] <luisiacc[m]> I run neovim with it's language servers and also have a webpack process reloadinng the app that I'm building, such webpack process takes a gigantic and atroceus amount of cpu usage, which makes neovim instance to become slow, does anyone know how can I like lower the priority of the webpack process or raise the priority of neovim?
[10:21:31] *** Quits: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav) (Quit: Ight Imma Head out)
[10:21:46] <numToStr[m]> download moar CPU ;)
[10:22:52] <numToStr[m]> Ok, so are you running webpack through nvim :terminal?
[10:23:09] <luisiacc[m]> oh no, hell no
[10:23:47] <numToStr[m]> (some people in the wild do that XD)
[10:26:00] <luisiacc[m]> every time the server reloads and tries to lint with eslint and type checks, the neovim instance as well as the completion requests become very slow
[10:27:03] <numToStr[m]> maybe you can tell webpack to not lint or typecheck when you are on DEV mode
[10:27:30] <numToStr[m]> (i never used webpack so I am just throwing ideas)
[10:29:14] <numToStr[m]> I also runs nodemod w/ ts-node + mogodb + redis + proxy (typical server setup) on my local machine and I also get occasional lags so nothing surprising though
[10:29:26] <numToStr[m]> or vite :]
[10:30:01] <luisiacc[m]> vite is astonishing fast because uses esbuild underneith, I use it on my new projects
[10:30:50] <numToStr[m]> yup, it's so much better for new projects 
[10:31:21] <numToStr[m]> old projects (w/ 1m loc webpack config) might have hard time migrating to vite
[10:32:27] <luisiacc[m]> I tried to migrate 1 project from webpack to vite, not fun
[10:33:09] <numToStr[m]> I also failed 2 projects at work that were created with CRA
[10:34:03] <numToStr[m]> and there is ESM mess

[18:10:08] <YorickPeterse[m]> numToStr: ordering of definitions and their use mattering is another. Or undefined locals resulting in `nil` opposed to an error, or various other issues
[18:10:33] <YorickPeterse[m]> `return true` in the middle of a function being a syntax error, but `if true then return true end` being fine
[18:10:50] <YorickPeterse[m]> I know why this is, but it's wack regardless
