[02:08:21] <enterprisey> I feel like DCC is a relic anyway
[02:09:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> For sure
[02:10:07] <pie_> I feel like I'm above average between normal people, and below average between high-iq people, and IDK what to do about it / make use of it / how to come to terms with it
[02:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Really amazing how straightforward the NSStreams version of the core network code is
[02:11:15] <ggreer> DCC is only useful for piracy and it's a huge security target
[02:11:39] <enterprisey> pie_: sure. I think about the really intelligent people and it feels like sitting in an airplane looking upward through the window at the darkening sky above, and I guess occasionally I'm unhappy about not being up there

[02:22:36] <gwern> (for those keeping count, this is the fourth one: 1. first car brakes failed on steep hill, forcing resort to parking breaks when rolling downhill at great speed, badly damaging the entire car frame and leading to it spontaneously catching on fire a few months later; 2. pickup truck brakes failed at 50mph+ on the highway on the way to a flight; flight was missed; 3. car brakes failed in...

[02:23:58] <ggreer> amusingly I had to disable the regen brakes on my car just to heat up the friction brakes enough to remove the glaze on the rotors
[02:23:58] <gwern> it's weird because all the other failures have been harmless. an entire goddamn oak tree fell square on my first car in a huge hurricane, but the branches just happened to land exactly right to support the tree. then when a tire blew, it was in the middle of nowhere and I just coast to a halt, nbd

[04:09:37] <feepbot> from 4 mm to 16 mm and the length of rebars ranges from 500 m to 800 m. The rebars are rolled up for transport. Due to the elasticity of rebars, they take their original shape when unrolling them.

[04:39:44] <kuudes> in maybe couple of weeks.
[04:39:51] <spxtr> I'm pretty done with lockdown. Vaccinated + boosted and tested weekly.
[04:40:15] <adiabatic> anyone who wants a booster can get it

[05:00:40] <adiabatic> which explains its transmissibility but why it doesn't seem to wreck people as badly usually
[05:03:46] <kuudes> omicron also progresses fast, you can get from infected to infective in hours, it seems
[05:04:04] <kuudes> adiabatic, it seems denmark observes omicron to be about as bad as delta, maybe
[05:04:35] <kuudes> there is the thing that as cases 10x per week, if you just compare today's hospitalizations to today's cases, you underestimate severity
[05:04:59] <kuudes> it could be that omicron is faster also from infection to hospital, death. that would be good
[05:05:13] <kuudes> because that would mean it is less severe with same data

[06:52:34] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The twentieth century’s most influential economist had the face of a swollen eel, so Virginia Woolf said, and they were quite good friends. She also wrote that he looked like a gorged seal with a double chin and a ledge of red lip, “sensual, brutal, unimaginative.” Keynes’s own opinion of his looks was no better. At twenty-three, he wrote to a male lover: “My
[06:52:34] <feepbot> dear, I have always suffered and I suppose always will from a most unalterable obsession that I am so physically repulsive that I’ve no business to hurl my body on anyone else’s.” He got over it. And with a statistician’s zeal for spreadsheets, he created an itemized list of the many men he slept with. It reads like a series of detective novels: The Bootmaker of Bordeaux;
[06:52:34] <feepbot> The Sculptor of Florence; The French Conscript; The Stable Boy of Park Lane. Keynes’s circle, the Bloomsbury group, was tolerant of gay sex, but British law was not. Oscar Wilde went to prison for sodomy when Keynes was twelve. His Cambridge friends distinguished between “Lower Sodomy,” which involved actual sex, and “Higher Sodomy,” when men loved each other’s minds.

[07:42:08] <gwern>  /doordashes ceo /everything in order is canine kibble /"you said dogfood is important"
[07:42:44] <gwern> also, doesn't being paid $400k make this less, not more, sympathetic?
[07:43:29] <gwern> you think doordash *wants* $100 of delivery time it's paying you $12k for? they're investing $12k in your education
[07:43:46] <catern> part of the culture of blind is mentioning total compensation in every post, which is why this poster included it
[07:47:30] <gwern> he's so outraged that he might have to work with his hands like some filthy peasant for 1 day a month to better understand what his job is all about
[07:48:02] <rmmh> 400K works out to >$200/hr
[07:48:30] <rmmh> so yeah corporate wants to invest several hundred dollars a month in making them try their end-user experience
[07:48:46] <rmmh> and it's not for a whole day. it's one order. that's surely doable in under an hour
[07:49:44] <gwern> I was doing it as 1/31 * 400k, since I assumed it'd be for the whole day. in the other examples, surely the amazon employees don't drive 1 single package out to the middle of the suburbs and then drive back and call it done?
[07:49:58] <gwern> doing *one* order is basically nothing at all
[07:50:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I'd be outraged too
[07:50:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I absolutely have no interest in working with my hands like a filthy peasant if I sign up for a dev job

[07:51:03] <gwern> yeah well he's free to quit if he thinks he can find a better job at $400k, otherwise, $400k is $400k
[07:51:23] <enterprisey> I fully support the decision to make the engineers use the stupid product
[07:51:26] <gwern> maybe he can. if so, then god speed, the free market at work, the american dream &etc
[07:51:31] <gwern> otherwise, dogfooding is great imo

[07:52:37] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: doordash is a two-sided market, or really, three-sided (buyer vs deliverator vs restaurant/store), so if you only use it as a buyer, you're getting less than half the experience

[08:00:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: Cool, they should allow substitution of doing your actual fucking job that you signed up for, for everyone
[08:01:20] <catern> nshepperd: the trick is never doing the training in the first place (which might be what you did)
[08:01:22] <enterprisey> I claim you care about this more than 2 standard deviations above how much people will generally care about this
[08:01:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're totally wrong about that
[08:01:39] <spxtr> I also managed to never do interviewing training at google.
[08:01:57] <enterprisey> well, it's not very falsifiable with the resources available to two people shitposting on irc, so we'll have to leave it there :)
[08:02:12] <enterprisey> spxtr: what team or general area, if you feel comfortable sharing?
[08:02:18] * enterprisey dreamed of joining google a decade ago
[08:02:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: Also, if they think this is valuable, they should instead hire people to do it, and/or make it clear when hiring that this'll be expected
[08:02:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: That they don't tells us most of what we need to know
[08:02:28] <spxtr> enterprisey: I was doing kubernetes stuff. Left for physics phd after 2 years
[08:02:32] <enterprisey> I see
[08:02:54] <enterprisey> Obormot|Arcturus: would you not agree that receiving a report from someone else on the experience is totally different from doing it yourself
[08:03:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[08:03:08] <catern> lol
[08:03:08] <spxtr> enterprisey: completely by chance was on the same team as rmmh for most of the time
[08:03:10] <rmmh> enterprisey: I worked with spxtr :) 
[08:03:14] <enterprisey> hehe
[08:03:21] <rmmh> did we start in the same quarter? I forget 
[08:03:30] <spxtr> I think you were one quarter after me
[08:03:46] <enterprisey> Obormot|Arcturus: ok, then I'm afraid we diverge a little bit too much for me to continue enjoying this conversation, so I'm gonna call it there
[08:03:53] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[08:04:05] <enterprisey> k8s scares me
[08:04:13] <enterprisey> but that's because I don't know a lick of it
[08:04:18] <enterprisey> perhaps someday I'll have to learn it
[08:04:27] <rmmh> we were doing tooling (github, mostly) for k8s
[08:04:49] <enterprisey> my current company is *gasp* entirely self-hosted on our own boxes
[08:04:50] <rmmh> like, dev CI / PR bot stuff 
[08:05:02] <spxtr> k8s is a nice idea at the core but suffers from poorly constrained feature creep
[08:05:05] <enterprisey> in fact I'm down the hall from a few freestanding server racks
[08:05:15] <catern> that's the way enterprisey 
[08:05:40] <enterprisey> spxtr: that's the sort of sentence that comes from many years of experience or reading a comment on HN by someone who has, and I doubt the latter :)
[08:06:17] <enterprisey> catern: see it's the ideal HN setup but one of the cpus was like 176 C (110 C ambient) the other day because the aircon blew and nobody gave a shit
[08:06:30] <rmmh> spxtr: Apr 2016
[08:06:39] <catern> that's what thermal throttling is for
[08:06:50] <enterprisey> but if you have a team that cares I'm sure it's a lot of fun except when drives die

[08:07:36] <spxtr> oh yeah I love that channel. also practical engineering, has a similar looking host
[08:07:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A Google employee adjacent to the scene told me a rumor that SIAI researchers had previously discussed assassinating AGI researchers (including someone who had previously worked with SIAI and was working on an AGI project that they thought was unaligned) if they got too close to developing AGI. These were not concrete plans for immediate action, but were nonetheless a serious discussion on the topic of assassination and under

[08:07:56] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:08:11] <rmmh> the host looks vaguely similar to you. A cousin, maybe 
[08:08:27] <gwern> so this is a rumor, of a rumor, of a rumor of a hypothetical discussion?
[08:08:34] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, what? didn't they read gwern's page against terrorism?
[08:08:44] <spxtr> rmmh: I was Nov 2015
[08:08:45] <catern> although assassination != bombing fabs
[08:08:55] <enterprisey> bomb fabs in minecraft as praxis
[08:09:04] <gwern> also, I already explained that you should bomb fabs, not assassinate researchers. researchers and ideas are too cheap to be worth assasinating
[08:09:21] <gwern> bomb TSMC though, and *that* will put a hell of a crimp in any AGI timelines

[08:09:44] <gwern> (but no, something like gpt-3, it would've come along in 2 or 3 years if dario and sutskever et al had never lived)
[08:09:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Robomot didn't crash...
[08:09:54] <enterprisey> I see a quit
[08:10:01] <rmmh> ironic. The Great Man theory of history falls apart for AGI, where it's actually a distributed network 
[08:10:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes it dc'd from libera.chat
[08:10:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> But why
[08:10:07] <catern> the quit came from inside the house!!!
[08:10:38] <nshepperd> assassinating the gan researchers might well have accelerated agi
[08:11:02] <gwern> nshepperd: ah, but schmidhuber already invented gans at least a decade before

[08:11:27] <nshepperd> schmidhubered again

[08:13:04] <catern> do you need more schmidhubers then?
[08:13:34] <catern> or is taking credit for a dead end not as useful as actually making one...

Many people don’t speak out because of the ridicule and discrediting factors,” Rosin says...A few days before the drug became illegal in the US in 1985, Rosin says, she took a suitcase full of MDMA to a friend’s apartment in Moscow. In walked mutual friends with empty medicine bottles, which she proceeded to fill with tablets of Ecstasy. “It
[08:54:03] <feepbot> was the most loving, wonderful experience that you could possibly have, because it was in that state of peace and love,” Rosin says. “It wasn’t to get high; it wasn’t to have a party. No. It was about peace, love and healing—and spreading that around the world.” Reached for comment about the impact of Doblin and Rosin’s covert action, author Pollan said: “I think
[08:54:08] <feepbot> it’s highly unlikely Rick’s gift reached its intended recipient—surely someone prevents top government officials from taking pills sent by someone in an adversary’s population.” But Rosin delivered the MDMA personally, she says, subverting officials and sharing the drug with her friends, which included scientists and defense figures.'

In retrospect, it’s pretty clear that Melendez and the team didn’t

[19:48:30] <two2thehead> "In this study, we examine a set of primary data collected from 484 students enrolled in a large public university in the Mid-Atlantic United States region during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, called Ties data, included students' demographic and support network information. The support network data comprised of information that highlighted the type of support, (i.e. emotional or educational; routine or intense). Using this 
[19:48:30] <two2thehead> data set, models for predicting students' academic achievement, quantified by their self-reported GPA, were created using Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), a decision tree algorithm, and cforest, a random forest algorithm that uses conditional inference trees. We compare the methods' accuracy and variation in the set of important variables suggested by each algorithm. Each algorithm found different variables important for different 
[19:48:31] <two2thehead> student demographics with some overlap. For White students, different types of educational support were important in predicting academic achievement, while for non-White students, different types of emotional support were important in predicting academic achievement.

[22:59:06] <gwern> Trippy to think about how "a large part of the earth is still in the Urne unto us"; we know for centuries there's a library buried under ash & lava containing more Greco-Roman works than the entire surviving Greco-Roman corpus, all documents, epigraphs, papyrus fragments etc. In a century we'll be able to read them all, and half of classics will be toast - a new history here, an Archimedes...
[22:59:12] <gwern> ...manuscript where he writes down everything about Antithykera and the calculus there, a totally undiscovered industrial innovation like an assembly line here... (You see the number 1,800 scrolls, but that's just the number retrieved from just the one alcove of Herculaneum! Think of how much Nag Hammadi & Dead Sea revolutionized our understanding of ancient religion, with mere fragments and...
[22:59:18] <gwern> ...a few hundred scrolls equivalent. Now try 20k.) It's strange to read a paper about, eg, Julius Caesar's last words or about the Antithykera mechanism or Barbegal or the Nemi ships, and have to append a mental asterisk: "...But of course, all of this is wildly ignorant guesswork, and will probably be trashed post-Herculaneum, lol sorry"... yet, classicists walk around every day like normal...
[22:59:24] <gwern> ...people, and sit down at their desks working, instead of curling up in the corner moaning to themselves, "what's it all for? what's the point, herculaneum hasn't opened yet. why bother saying anything when it'll be wrong?" just publishing papers, like a sociopath. Even when you know there is approaching 'some essential singularity in the history' of a field and acknowledge a known unknown,...
[22:59:30] <gwern> ...it still feels normal & comprehensive. I feel this about AI. Intellectually, I know the capabilities of a decade or two from now will dwarf now, but... 
[23:00:40] <gwern> I mean, even an off-handed reference in passing would be enough to destroy millennium-old interpretations and 'facts', never mind suddenly dumping literally thousands of completely new works by completely new authors
[23:00:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's Herculaneum
[23:00:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the aristocrat's library buried under pompeii's lava/ash
[23:01:21] <gwern> they dug down a few centuries ago, discovered the carbonized scrolls, failed to do anything but destroy most of them, and filled the hole back up
[23:01:52] <gwern> it's just this bizarre D&D-esque mother lode of artifacts, far more important than the qin emperror's unexcavated tomb, eg
[23:02:39] <gwern> "oh yeah, we just have 10 entire fields' worth of books no one has ever read just sitting there in the dirt. we know exactly where it all is, just can't read'em. hm. maybe someone should do something about that. meh."
[23:03:14] <gwern> "yeah, there's probably a scroll in there that will completely falsify my entire life's work on the roman emperors. that would be annoying."
[23:03:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what's the block? Techniques to read the scrolls without destroying them?
[23:03:36] <gwern> yes
[23:03:47] <gwern> regular techniques don't work because they are carbon-on-carbon
[23:04:30] <gwern> so it's going to take really high powered, high quality x-ray or other imaging techniques, and maybe atomic-level deconstruction. all of which is, however, totally possible in a century if you look back at how much progress we've made on all this in the *past* century
[23:04:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah
[23:05:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I guess we should probably just defund the classics departments until then
[23:05:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Give the money to the people working on the x-ray atomic deconstruction lasers or w/e
[23:06:27] <gwern> not like they use up much money as it is, and if the traditions and knowledge aren't kept alive, there won't be anyone to study, but yes, I do feel a bit similar. why even bother, what is the value of producing all of this almost certainly wrong or incomplete classics research a few decades before Herculaneium unlocks?
[23:07:55] <gwern> it's like... a century is not even that long, and classicists seem like long-lived sorts in general. Someone starting their classics degree right now could well still be alive when it begins
[23:08:31] <gwern> just a very strange situation to try to put my mind into that of a classicist and think about this sword of damocles
[23:09:32] <gwern> AI is a pretty similar situation because we *know* compute budgets and efficiency will still go an OOM or two before they halt for good, and we know that another 2 OOMs plus continual refinement of methods is going to unlock a lot of crazy shit. but... what do you do about it?
[23:10:16] <gwern> if you knew which crazy shit, maybe you could prepare yourself or prep useful datasets or something to make your work last. but it's a known unknown, in addition to any unknown unknowns
[23:13:33] <gwern> the mind rejects this kind of epistemic nihilism. a horror vacui
[23:14:08] <gwern> you don't know where to paint these giant 'here be dragons' blank spaces on your mental map, and so they just get pushed to the edge as a general 'cloud of unknowing'
