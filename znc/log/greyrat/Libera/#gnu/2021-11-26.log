[09:07:36] <jxself> GNOME/GTK
[09:08:22] <rindolf> tpefreedom: there are several bona-fide FOSS ui toolkits, e.g: https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/portability-libs/#gui
[09:09:49] <tpefreedom> jxself, GNOME is effectively separate from GNU nowadays.
[09:09:55] <jxself> And?
[09:10:28] <jxself> Does that mean they can't still call out maintainers of GNU packages to use it, in the GNU Coding Standards?
[09:12:10] <tpefreedom> they still can.
[09:12:28] <tpefreedom> It just means that it is no longer under GNU's control.
[09:13:00] <jxself> Okay and so I think there's the answer to your question then. The GNU Coding Standards still say to use GNOME and GTK regardless.

[13:04:55] <bill-auger> in other words, distro maintainers have more control over the software that their users run, than any upstream; because their control is absolute - the upstreams have zero control over the software, when other people compile it
[13:06:49] <bill-auger> so the question is mis-guided - it is not important to any user what GNU "controls" - GNU controls source code, but that is not what people actually use
[13:07:53] <bill-auger> "GNU" is not practically useful software to users; because (ignoring guixsd for a moment) it is not a readily usable operating system - some assembly is required - in that case, you, the user, is in full control over that assembly process
[13:08:11] <kilobug> bill-auger: well GNU "controlling" source code has some importance in terms of GPL enforcement or being future-proof in case of new legal issues; but I agree it's not the most important for users

[13:10:43] <bill-auger> in other words, the individual upstreams are generally uninteresting to users - the only people for whom most *nix users should have any ethical concerns, are the maintainers of their distro
[13:11:21] <bill-auger> likewise, the only software for which most *nix users should have any technical concerns, is the software distributed by their distro, and only in the precise downstream form, not the upstream form; becuase that is not the software they are actualy using - the distro build is; and that may differ arbitrarily from the upstream. both ethically and technically
[13:13:31] <bill-auger> in other words, i would not worry how much love GNU has for GNOME - people should be much more concerned with what their dirtos maintainers love and impose on them

[13:24:32] <bill-auger> if the distro has a problem with GNOME, it will change it, or cease distributing it - if users do not agree with the ethical or technical decisions of their distro, they should find another distro - all this is accomplished without and regardless of any upstream developer's intentions, endorsement, knowledge, or cooperation

[13:27:33] <kilobug> bill-auger: that's only true to a point; yes, sure, a distro can disable a feature that is considered unethical (such as sending back data without user consent); but when the upstream take a technical or ethical decision that can have major consequences that is not possible to fix by the distro, and "cease distributing it" may not be easy if there is no viable alternative

[21:17:17] <bandali> rindolf, cheers. yeah it's helpful to have your client hide these join/part messages like GNUHacker mentioned. some are even smarter, and e.g. can be configured to hide them only for people who haven't spoken in a day or so
