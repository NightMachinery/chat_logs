[00:00:39] <tinsoldier> CQD — Noun: 1. Initialism of colloidal quantum dot. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CQD
[00:01:05] <blkshp> CQD is SOS before SOS
[00:01:16] * blkshp summons a radio operator
[00:01:26] <xenial-user5> tinsoldier:  CQD
[00:01:28] <tinsoldier> CQD is one of the first distress signals adopted for radio use. On 7 January 1904 the Marconi International Marine Communication Company issued 'Circular 57', which specified that, for the company's installations, beginning 1 February 1904 'the call to be given by ships in distress or in any way requiring assistance shall be 'C Q D' '.

[02:51:52] <kurahaupo> LuisP14: I know "CQ" as a general "is anyone listening" but I hadn't come across "CQD". If memory serves, SOS was the new standard when the Titanic sank, so its radio operator sent both the old and new code, but I don't know what the old code was.
[02:53:24] <LjL> On 15 April 1912, RMS Titanic radio operator Jack Phillips initially sent "CQD", which was still commonly used by British ships. Harold Bride, the junior radio operator, suggested using SOS, saying half-jokingly that it might be his last chance to use the new code. Phillips thereafter began to alternate between the two.[4](p1911) Although Bride survived, Phillips perished in the sinking.[12]

[03:03:36] <tinwhiskers> I only learned to use securite, mayday and pan pan for VHF, but then no morse is required.
[03:04:38] <kurahaupo> It seems that Marconi corp tried to mandate CQD as the distress signal, but it turned out to be less than obvious that it wasn't just CQ followed by some word starting with D, whereas SOS is sent without interletter timing gaps and so is quite distinct
[03:04:52] <tinwhiskers> I've only ever made securite calls though
[03:05:01] <tinwhiskers> thankfully
[03:06:09] <kurahaupo> so why is "mayday" spelled thus, instead of "m'aidez"
[03:06:35] <tinwhiskers> huh. I didn't know that's what it meant. makes sense. thanks.
[03:07:35] <tinwhiskers> I guess they spell it that way to make it easy for a wider range of people to pronounce
[03:08:09] <LjL> Air France's callsign is officially "AIR FRANS"
[03:08:22] <kurahaupo> There should be a Canadian version: "Maid eh?"
[03:08:27] <tinwhiskers> heh
[03:09:17] <LjL> it's funny that spelling/pronouncing it "mayday" makes it easiest for Americans - and yet, American pilots are by far the most shy at using "mayday mayday mayday" as opposed to just "declaring an emergency" or even "uhm, i guess we're officially declaring" or just nothing
[03:09:31] <LjL> (although in recent ATC recordings i've heard mayday from Americans, i think the FAA made it more required)

[15:53:26] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[15:53:46] <Voxel> Is it grammatically correct for a chat?: "Some tiny sample from projects currently working on:"
[15:55:01] <huf> missing "I'm" between "projects" and "currently"
[15:55:14] <Voxel> I didn't want to use "Y"
[15:55:16] <Voxel> I*
[15:55:34] <Voxel> Usually, I'm trying to omit these Is. It looks selfish...
[15:55:38] <huf> nah
[15:57:06] <Voxel> Is it allowed to omit it liked tat for chat messages?
[15:57:12] <Voxel> that*
[15:57:35] <Voxel> What if "...currently am working on..."?
[15:57:49] <huf> nah, still sounds off
[15:57:54] <Voxel> Indeed...
[15:58:04] <huf> "some sample from current projects:"
[15:58:20] <Voxel> What if "...currently 'am working on..."?
[15:58:21] <huf> "sample of current projects:"
[15:58:38] <huf> but there's really no need to commit grammatical errors to avoid "I"
[15:58:48] <huf> selfishness has nothing to do with using that word
[15:58:48] <Voxel> I see...
[15:59:04] <huf> ffs, royals use the royal we
[15:59:09] <huf> and there's nobody more selfish than them! :DF
[15:59:36] <Voxel> Perhaps, but... in chat when no one has been spoken in hours, such "I" may attract to much attention 
[16:00:13] <Voxel> too*

[16:19:21] <Babar> if it is just 1 sample, it can't be from multiple projects, can it?

[16:31:06] <Voxel> Like, "I'm sorry, but while the work looks neat, please check the rules."
[16:31:39] <Voxel> Is it grammatically correct, at least? ^^
[16:37:31] <Babar> it is grammatically correct
[16:37:36] <Babar> but it sounds weird
[16:37:53] <Voxel> How would you say that?
[16:38:00] <Babar> depends what you want to say
[16:38:31] <Babar> neatness doesn't sound relevant. It'd be like saying "You're very well dressed, but you really shouldn't murder people"
[16:38:36] <Voxel> Just trying to tell them to check rules and simultaneously point out their work's neatness 
[16:39:30] <Babar> be like the condenscending attitude of teachers in school "Your handwriting is very nice, but all your answers are wrong", as if they're just trying to find some random nice thing to say to complement the bad stuff

[16:48:10] <Babar> yes, I wasn't providing an alternative, I was giving you a more evident example of why your statement wasn

[19:38:59] <Babar> ahyes, you might be right there
[19:39:13] <Babar> I thought about using Trinitys, but wasn't sure if that was a rule: inviolability of name integrity, even if it is derived from an actual english word
[19:41:26] <hoglahoo> pretty sure it's a rule, yes
[19:42:46] <kurahaupo> It depends which style manual you read. Some treat proper nouns like any other, so "one Trinity, two Trinities". Others take the spelling to be an important part of a name's identifying power, and get "two Trinitys". The apostrophe plural is normally reserved for plurals of initials and initialisms, "mind your P's and Q's" but not "two Trinity's"
[19:43:13] <Babar> which is the most correct style guide? :P
[19:45:17] <kurahaupo> Then they also differ on possessives: The Jones' dog vs The Jones's dog vs The Joneses's dog

[20:08:39] <Babar> that is still not correctly written, Arslan. I am going to take a guess that you are trying to ask "Where are the animals you have met from?"
[20:09:28] <Arslan> yep but you have a brain please use it when it necessary

[20:32:53] <Babar> I wonder if privacy has a related etymology to pry
[20:33:12] <TimMc> Seems doubtful.
[20:33:30] <Arslan> TimMc hello  you must be  very funny mman
[20:33:36] <Arslan> what a joke!
[20:34:33] <Babar> +a
[20:34:53] <Babar> unless that was a bot doing some sort of madlibs action. The weird spacing does suggest that
[20:34:54] <TimMc> Hah, Wiktionary says pry comes from “to look closely, peer into, pry, spy” <- “to look narrowly, to squint at” <- something to do with closing the eyes
[20:34:57] <TimMc> wild
[20:35:06] <LjL> or the desire to pree, depending on who you are
[20:35:10] <Babar> :O
[20:35:14] <Babar> don't pree
[20:35:59] <Arslan> thank you grande Tim. now you can take your place 
[20:36:02] <TimMc> However, it says private is from Latin for “bereaved, deprived, set apart from”
[20:36:53] <Babar> oh
[20:36:54] <Babar> too bad
[20:36:58] <TimMc> and pry could have multiple roots (pry bar would be different, ithink) so I could see them both coming from "to separate"
[20:37:07] <Babar> oh
[20:37:09] <Babar> ok, then
[20:37:30] <TimMc> More research required. :-P

[20:59:34] <Voxel> The feature is known. Perhaps, "A notification of the feature restriction" is better.
[21:00:40] <ash_worksi> I am writing a sql function that rolls a salt; a phaseout parameter will be set on the old salt. What's a good word for the new salt meaning "it will be in full effect" ... perhaps active_by ?
[21:01:27] <Babar> both seem fine, Voxel
[21:01:50] <ash_worksi> the word I'm looking for will be the name of the parameter that sets the phaseout on the old salt, but I don't want the function to read as though you're setting a TTL for the new salt
[21:02:19] <Voxel> Phaseout?
[21:06:11] <Voxel> What does mean "salt phaseout"?
[21:07:19] <ash_worksi> Voxel: our system distributes these salts to 3rd party apps; dropping support for them means that the contributed source data the salts encode wont be useable; hence, the needs to be a period of time where the source data is still valid but it can be re-encoded with a new salt over time. This is called "phasing out"
[21:07:41] <ash_worksi> there* needs be a period
[21:08:09] <ash_worksi> there* needs (to)* be a period
[21:09:00] <ash_worksi> contributed source data which* the salts encode
[21:09:51] <ash_worksi> Voxel: our system distributes these salts to 3rd party apps; dropping support for them means that the contributed source data which the salts encode wont be useable; hence, there needs to be a period of time where the source data is still valid but it can be re-encoded with a new salt over time.

[21:09:59] <ash_worksi> ^ fixed typos
[21:10:23] <ash_worksi> I think I'm going to use "__active_by"

[21:13:16] <ash_worksi> Voxel: no, that's exactly what I *dont* want
[21:13:59] <Voxel> O.o
[21:14:19] <ash_worksi> the function inserts a NEW salt and sets an expiration of the OLD salt; I don't want the function to read like you're setting a TTL on the NEW salt.
[21:16:01] <ash_worksi> Voxel: I am looking for a word that coveys, "after this period, the *NEW* salt you've created will be fully functional"
[21:16:16] <ash_worksi> which to me is something like `__effective_by` or `__active_by`

[21:20:02] *** Joins: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-84-44-235-10.nc.de)
[21:20:17] <ash_worksi> I am actually starting to go the other way now and just write __phaseout_old
[21:20:23] <Voxel> __active
[21:20:52] <Voxel> __alive
[21:22:12] <TimMc> TLS probably works that way because the fields are (I think) *mandatory*, so there's never double-negation.
[21:22:20] <ash_worksi> also, ftr, validity_start_date would be close, but not exactly right; the idea here is that we have however many salts that are encoding the same data simultaneously; it isn't until either all the data has been reencoded or the phaseout period has lapsed (dropping support for anything not reencoded) will be distributed.
[21:22:24] <TimMc> and this gives a very clear interpretation if you're writing an implementation
[21:22:47] <ash_worksi> Voxel: yeah, I thought about __active_by
[21:22:58] <TimMc> ash_worksi: Ah, I'll have to re-read later with more attention.

[22:22:18] <Babar> I think it is in contrast to "civil law", rapha. And no, I don't think it comes from celtic tradition, but I wouldn't be sure
[22:22:30] <rapha> have you recently tried to connect to freenode? read His Imperial Highnesses blog entries? he declared Freenode a part of his KINGDOM now. i'm for realz here.
[22:23:15] <rapha> Babar: so basically, she is the dude's wife because they got wedded some other way than through whatever is the official way in the US?
[22:23:37] <Arslan> I didn't connect there because of you.
[22:23:45] <rapha> how cute
[22:24:12] <Arslan> You were very hard men
[22:24:36] <Babar> I suppose it could be so, rapha, yes. For example, there are some religious traditions that involve a sort of "marriage" that wouldn't be recognised in the US unless also accompanied by a civil marriage
[22:24:46] <Babar> not sure if those would be called "common law wife", though
[22:25:32] <Arslan> Babar's railway sentences
[22:25:35] <rapha> well, it seems to be a native speaker using that term ... our prof at uni always made sure to remind us that if it's used by a native speaker in colloquial speech it's definitely not okay to call it wrong
[22:25:55] <Babar> what is a railway sentence, Arslan, I don't think you clarified last time
[22:26:53] <rapha> perhaps he means hypotactical sentences :)
