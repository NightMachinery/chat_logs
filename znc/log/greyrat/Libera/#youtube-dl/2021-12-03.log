[18:03:32] <Jaxx> Hi all. a question. What was the full command if I want to download youttube videos from youtube and convert it to mp4 while using yt-dlp?
[18:04:52] <Jaxx> i didnt save the command last time someone gave me it.. all i know it has something to do with the word mp4 in between [ and ] ... thats all I can remember
[18:05:13] <Jaxx> and same with mp3 too
[18:10:23] <Jaxx> nvm.. found it
[18:11:18] <Jaxx> Is this the right command?: yt-dlp -f 'best[ext=mp4]' <youtube link>
[18:11:24] <nimaje> I think what you are remembering is format selection, that restricts yt-dl in what it downloads
[18:12:16] <gnoo> Jaxx: better to use --merge-output-format
[18:12:57] <nimaje> you probably want  --merge-format  but that only selects the format for merging, no idea if yt-dlp gained some option to convert to a choosen formate even when not merging
[18:13:20] <Jaxx> i know someone gave me the command. i know it had like MPÂ¤ word in it. thats y i need to know the exact command again
[18:13:44] <Jaxx> *MP4
[18:14:31] <gnoo> Jaxx: use yt-dlp --merge-output-format mp4 <url>. most of the times it'll be mp4. for the few ones it won't be, wait a little more
[18:15:24] <gnoo> for mp3, it's yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 <url>
[18:15:56] <Jaxx> no no.. not that. i know it bas something to do with best=mp4 in the command for sure. but i dont remember who gave me it
[18:16:42] *** Quits: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479) (Quit: see you later)
[18:16:56] <gnoo> Jaxx: for mp4, you'll use yt-dlp --merge-output-format mp4 --remux-video mp4 <url> 
[18:17:06] <gnoo> yes, those are different that do different things
[18:17:08] *** Joins: hpkn (~hpkn@gateway/tor-sasl/hpkn)
[18:17:16] <nimaje> that will restrict yt-dl to only download mp4 files, that will not convert it to mp4
[18:17:33] <nimaje> (the  -f 'best[ext=mp4]' one)
[18:17:48] <gnoo> [best=mp4] will download the file which the server provides as mp4. this will download the best video, see it it is mp4, if not, convert's it to mp4
[18:20:56] <Jaxx> so it was this command?: yt-dlp -f 'best[ext=mp4]' <youtube link>
[18:22:34] <gnoo> yes, it was that but that's not really good. i mean use it if you want that...
[18:22:57] <gnoo> i'd recommend you to use this tho: yt-dlp --merge-output-format mp4 --remux-video mp4 <url> 
[18:23:26] <gnoo> (idk if those both are necessary, i think the second one is enough but just to be safe)

[18:39:19] <Jaxx> gnoo, whats the difference between the one u posted and the one I posted? and what does --remux-video do as well as this --merge-output part?

[18:43:06] <Jaxx> but i save the command u posted as well
[18:43:52] <Jaxx> oh btw.. how do i use the same command,but instead of using youtube link.. How do i use it with the name/title of whatever video i download?
[18:44:16] <gnoo> 'ytsearch: <title>'
[18:46:04] <nimaje> keep in mind that sometimes the server just doesn't have a mp4 for the video or it is lower quality than other versions the server has
[18:46:35] <Jaxx> so use the "ytsearch: title" instead of youtube link?

[18:48:38] <kib> how do i download the smallest 480p video of every video in a youtube playlist ?

[18:49:27] <gnoo> is there multiple 480p versions?
[18:50:10] <kib> yes
[18:50:22] <kib> i want the smallest size one
[18:52:05] <gnoo> so, there's --format-sort size
[18:52:53] <kib> side note: i have yt-dlp too if that's relevant or has an option built in for this kind of thing
[18:53:10] <gnoo> you'll have to figure out how to reverse the default selection which will likely be the highest

[18:55:03] <gnoo> idk how it works, it's in the manpage

[18:57:22] <kib> that is similar to just saying -S "res:480" in yt-dlp, but what i want is a little different. if theres multiple formats (mp4,webm etc) of a video available then i want to download the one which is smaller in size
