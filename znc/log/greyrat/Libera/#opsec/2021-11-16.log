[03:40:41] <jan6> hai
[03:40:53] <jan6> 3 days old news I suppose
[03:41:35] *** Quits: Fault (~Fault@150.230.39.7) (Quit: Quit.)
[03:48:18] <Joanna> Thanks for the interesting links as always:)
[03:49:40] <jan6> tl;dr one of their portals allowed public signups, and basically sent the mail client-side through a simple POST to the server, and you could just edit the POST request to sent whatever mail you wanted
[03:49:42] <jan6> lol
[03:50:22] <jan6> so no data was accessed, just some classic trolling, old-school hacker way
[03:51:07] <Joanna> I think the person who did it is kind of dumb though I‚Äôd keep that info to myself..
[03:51:18] <jan6> well, they WANTED to point that out
[03:51:47] <jan6> they even explicitly said in the interview that they 1000% could've used it for more serious usages
[03:52:35] <Joanna> Seems like a publicity stunt ..
[03:52:50] <jan6> but no proper and official security researcher would go around tampering with government pages which have a noticeable notice at the bottom that "unauthorized access may result in penalties" and whatnot
[03:52:57] <jan6> as they say
[03:53:10] <jan6> of course, nobody knows if the person claiming to be responsible, is actually the one
[03:53:50] <Joanna> I think the whole thing illustrates that security is just an illusion
[03:54:09] <Joanna> Ugh spellcheck did it again
[03:54:29] <jan6> the world is a lie!
[03:54:30] <jan6> lol
[03:54:34] <jan6> of course
[03:55:11] <jan6> moreso it illustrates the problem of "somebody once built that system, but we've not checked its security in the last 5 years"

[04:17:56] <Joanna> I was told s story recently by someone in another channel about how he worked for a corporation that did something related to insurance and he had done the work of importing the database the. He left the company and another employee was supposed to take care of updating the database and the company thought that she was fooling around updating the database because he had already done it. So they fired her and the database wasn‚Äôt updated and 
[04:17:57] <Joanna> they lost all their customers and went bankrupt. They called him to ask for help putting the blame on the woman they fired for trying to update the database....

[14:20:28] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[14:41:23] <grobi> hello there
[14:43:52] <Joanna> Hi grobi :)
[14:44:09] <grobi> how is life Joanna ?
[14:45:12] <Joanna> I‚Äôve been sort of counfounded by resizing behavior involving a flow panel lately
[14:45:32] <Joanna> I think I probably should try to work on something else.
[14:47:58] <grobi> yeah sometimes it helps to change ones focus onto something totally different and to get back, when one feel the time is right..
[14:49:13] <grobi> forcing onto something can prison ones mind

[14:53:39] <Joanna> Sometimes you can defer things sometimes you have to find the problem and fix it.
[14:54:21] <Joanna> I‚Äôm definitely going to consider redesigning it.
