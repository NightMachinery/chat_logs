[12:34:55] <Enfors> Isn't org-roam supposed to allow the creation of nodes with spaces in their name? When I use org-roam-node-insert or org-roam-capture and try to create a node name with a space, I get "[No match]" in the minibuffer as soon as I type the SPC in the name.
[12:37:14] <Enfors> I don't understand why it's trying to match anything in the first place. I'm writing the name of a new node to be created! I turned off ido-mode, but that doesn't seem to have made a difference.
[16:04:16] <JuhaAutero[m]> C-q SPC
[16:10:40] <JuhaAutero[m]> I had the same problem, but as an old Emacs user I luckily knew about quoted insert.
[16:19:23] <JuhaAutero[m]> Reason you can't insert space is that it is used in completion https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Completion-Commands.html
[16:48:39] <Enfors> JuhaAutero[m]: Oh I see, yes that explains it! Thank you very much!
[16:50:46] <Enfors> I'm so glad I found org-roam. As if org-mode on its own wasn't awesome enough! Without exaggeration, I think I can say that to some extend, org-roam will change my life. I'll take all my notes there from now on, building a second brain as a lifelong project. The idea is fantastic. 
[16:51:40] <Enfors> Some 15 - 20 years ago, I build my own wiki engine in PHP to make a personal wiki. But I didn't realize the full potential of that concept until the other day when I learned about Zettelkasten and org-roam.
