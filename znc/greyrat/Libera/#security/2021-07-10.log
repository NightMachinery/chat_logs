Dell has not announced or publicly explained the methods used.

[20:33:06] <Halaspre> I have a business plan, so a static IP is no problem
[20:33:18] <Halaspre> because right now, I am just reverse proxying everything to a VPS
[20:34:28] <npc> resi uploads normally rubbish and if that pipe fills your entire net goes down anyway

[20:35:11] <Halaspre> not an actual address
[20:35:13] <Halaspre> but still...
[20:36:30] <Halaspre> I guess there's a way to prevent my public SSH key from being somehow scraped by shodan?
[20:37:30] <npc> the way home connections scale normally maes it stupidly easy to ddos if your 1up 4down or 10 up 100 down you can still nuke someone elses entire connection with a single connection unless your doing QoS and rate limiting properly
[20:37:41] <Halaspre> yeah, hmm
[20:38:16] <npc> its the same as torrents the internets normally just sluggish until the upload cap is hit then disables completly
[20:38:26] <Halaspre> well, that doesn't happen for me
[20:38:42] <Halaspre> I don't have a crappy consumer router, though
[20:38:52] <Halaspre> I'm gonna upgrade to a VyOS-based router from a RB3011
[20:39:03] <Halaspre> because MikroTik can't handle VLAN routing at 1Gbps

[20:39:14] <Halaspre> and yes, I fucked up getting the RB3011

[20:39:21] <npc> most of the dsl/adsl speeds are covered by really cheap gear
[20:39:51] <Halaspre> like, what I am thinking of is just blacklisting everything from shodan/censys

[20:42:07] <Halaspre> hmm
[20:42:53] <mats1> lol sure, but hes got to be running an associated protocol for amplification like that
[20:43:07] <Halaspre> well, in the past, I used to use imageboards... I no longer do after basically getting almost harassed
[20:43:29] <npc> an http server get request with normal up/down ratio tuning would dos resi connections really easily from a hand full of nodes
[20:44:10] <Halaspre> a lot of users got angry over the things I did to their poorly-written sites, e.g. I exploited vulnerabilities in their site's backend, etc
[20:44:15] <mats1> the recent bittorrent reflected ddos is like 50x, many times better than dns or ntp related attacks
[20:44:16] <npc> if you get 4mb down and 1mb up... then i can send 1mb up worth of get requests to pull 4mb down... if your on another resi connection with 1mb then i just dos'd your entire http server
[20:44:35] <Halaspre> but those imageboards are basically now dead
[20:44:45] <Halaspre> very little users who actually still care, so I guess I'm just being paranoid
[20:45:10] <npc> on a resi connection with more down than up youll take your internet connection out from a handfull of users
[20:45:27] <mats1> itd b less of a headache to just front a static site on vultr for two fiddy a month
[20:45:52] <Halaspre> mats1: yeah, I'm doing that already, but I guess if I just get a new domain, with the registrar's NSes, I should be okay?
[20:46:15] <Halaspre> I don't plan on hosting sites without reverse proxying it
[20:46:46] <Halaspre> I would like to host an email server (postfix/dovecot) for server alerting. I can't really do that on a VPS because their IP ranges are blacklisted
[20:46:54] <Halaspre> as long as I lock it down well, I will be OK, I think
[20:46:55] <mats1> yeah, namesilo or whoever offers free whois privacy
[20:47:01] <Halaspre> yep, I know all of that
[20:47:26] <Halaspre> *server alerts
[20:47:39] <npc> i ran smtp/dns/http/irc on a home connection for nearly 3 years and had about 4 people use it so i wouldnt worry at all, doesnt change the fact i could
[20:47:55] <Halaspre> hmm... yeah, you're right. I am just being paranoid...
[20:48:06] <npc> take the lot of it down from my work connection with a single box ^_^
[20:48:08] <Halaspre> I guess just don't share info about it with any of those users
[20:48:18] <Halaspre> like, don't even mention the domain, etc
[20:48:41] <npc> to the point anyone trying to use the home connections internet would just stop working or trickle stream at 100kbs
[20:49:10] <Halaspre> I already have a suspicion that one of the users might have the VPS' IP because one of those sites literally didn't hash the user IPs properly
[20:49:19] <Halaspre> and I once ran a chatbot from that VPS, thinking that it was fine

[21:49:57] <bewees> Halaspre: why?
[21:50:02] <Halaspre> like, even the cheapest ryzen boards should have IOMMU
[21:50:10] <bewees> I see
[21:50:14] <Halaspre> well, you might want to pass through a PCIe device in the future
[21:50:26] <Halaspre> like, a VGA capture card, etc
[21:50:30] <bewees> I read most issues with IOMMU is that grouping doesn't always work smoothly
[21:50:39] <Halaspre> hmm... yeah, I'm not sure
[21:50:47] <Halaspre> I had no problems with IOMMU, though
[21:50:59] <Halaspre> I used an Asrock B450M-HDV r4

[21:52:09] <Halaspre> shipping is like 16 euros
[21:52:59] <bewees> oh i prefer ryzen to save on power consumption
[21:53:17] <bewees> those are meant for data centers, they pay much less for power than end users
[21:53:23] <Halaspre> bewees: hmm... you can get the same results with a dell R210, for instance
[21:53:32] <Halaspre> I own a R710, and use a 350W PSU
[21:53:37] <Halaspre> doesn't use 350W always, though
[21:53:42] <Halaspre> only if I max it out to the extreme
[21:53:48] *** Joins: Razorien (~Razorien@188.241.156.109)
[21:53:54] <Halaspre> personally, I would go for a R720
[21:54:04] <bewees> I think mine uses about 80W with a few disks
[21:54:13] <Halaspre> or a R820, or an EPYC-based server
[21:54:14] <Halaspre> but aw
[21:54:16] <Halaspre> so expensive
[21:55:28] <bewees> so I'm going to calculate with 100-110€ ryzen board, really want to avoid paying 200€ just for a motherboard :-)
[21:56:18] <flyback> having a iommu is good to have
[21:56:22] <flyback> it blocks some dma attacks
[21:56:26] <bewees> Halaspre: yes, with poweredge you also got a proper backplane. that's useful when you have many hdds in it, all enterprise features
[21:56:27] <Halaspre> bewees: if you are fine with a zen 1 CPU, check aliexpress
[21:56:34] <Halaspre> they are like $90 USD
[21:56:36] <Halaspre> so cheap

[21:57:56] <bewees> flyback: i think the main difference with the 200€ to the 100€ ryzen boards is that the former put all devices into the same group; I will see what people recommend for 3900x
[21:58:44] <bewees> I need like 12 cores as I want to run more than 6 VMs, some with decent load
