I've already been over a bunch of SSH tunneling and proxy failures so now I'm down to the manual dependency finding and downloading approach. Is there a switch to "$ pip install" that will tell me which packages and versions if it _going_ to install, without actually doing it, so I can go and fetch them?

[00:43:02] <mags> so, I just finished the chapter on string formatting in Learning Python 5e, also read online a little about f-strings.  Is there a best practice to what string formatting method I should be using?  It seems there are 3 different systems.
[00:44:11] <phox> mags: usually kinda whatever whatever thing oyu're working on has adopted as a standard
[00:44:44] <phy1729> dante-as: it's not documented, but getLevelNamesMapping is in logging's __all__
[00:44:46] <phox> there are some times when due to like, identifier/expression length either approach can get hideous (having a giant 50-character expression inside of an f-string can be awful for example) so sometimes picking what makes your code more readable is the right answer
[00:44:47] <mags> I'm thinking of going full f-strings for any brand new projects I start, seeing as it's the latest and greatest
[00:45:36] <phox> yeah it's not a bad default.  I do slightly dislike the fact that I have to mix quotes for them, but that's cosmetic.  and as mentioned sometimes they get unruly so that's a reason to use a normal format string in that sort of situation.
[00:46:09] <phy1729> Ah sorry it's new in 3.11
[00:46:32] <dante-as> phy1729: it's not also in 3.6?
[00:47:39] <phy1729> I think what you want (for now at least) is    DEBUG = logging.DEBUG
[00:47:56] <phy1729> because logging.DEBUG is 10

[01:46:04] <phox> ApostleInTriumph: uh, because this thing where you're doing an import based on the execution path and expecting that to resolve is what's unconventional, you might want to use importlib directly instead

[01:46:32] <phox> either that or if you want to assume $PWD Is relevant in general, you can modify sys.path within your app
[01:47:01] <phox> kinda depends how global you want that assumption to be.  I would not want to mess up other imports or create collisions so I would use importlib, personally.

[01:48:12] <phox> ApostleInTriumph: but overall, this is all because the Python package/import system is designed to be agnostic of where you run it from, which allows for virtualenvs etc to behave better without magical stuff happening to the software behaviour depending what your working dir is

[01:49:21] <phox> now if you use the repl usually sys.path starts with '' or '.' or whatever the convention is there, which makes sense in an interactive standpoint (for context for what you import from the repl cli), but from an app/package standpoint you absolutely want the default to be a static set of package paths
[01:49:48] <SnoopJ> ApostleInTriumph, the reason is because Python doesn't like guessing at what the user means, and you're not using a package. If you want to use relative importing, you should really make a package.

[10:56:07] <fakenullie> audio: it could be the glob.glob(f'{spectrogram_filename_full_path}*') part
[10:56:21] <fakenullie> audio: as number of processed files rise, it will have to list all of them
[10:57:04] <fakenullie> audio: better test full filename with os.path.exists
[10:57:22] <audio> fakenullie, well yea, but the problem with that idea is that the script always starts off very fast
[10:57:33] <audio> so i end up stopping and starting the scripting every few minutes

[11:01:14] <fakenullie> TML: because the created files are still there after the process restart

[14:02:36] <Pi-sistance> it just feels inconsistent!
[14:03:20] <lericson> what
[14:03:38] <grawity> because you're literally working with nested lists, not with 3D arrays or matrices or some other mathy concepts

[18:09:14] <xheimlich> yes, but we keep pretending it's a single thing.

[19:16:38] <shanali> Folks I am running into a problem with regards to graph implementation within python. The problem is related to describing a constraint of an edge. e.g. 1,2 is the edge which constraint of pointofentry at 1 as 1 (for 1st entrance) and pointonentry at 2 as 1 (for the 1st entrance) and then subsequently defining 2,3 using pointofentry at 2 as 2 (for
[19:16:39] <shanali> diverse entrance to 1st edge). Creating lists through graphs is giving me direction based errors like 3,1 edge is not getting me the right entrances

[19:18:45] <grym> you do not need to install poetry with every base interpreter you use with it; you must obviously install it with at least one interpreter, which becomes the default interpreter poetry uses to make things
[19:19:11] <grym> (... so, if you want your default to be not-system python, then don't install poetry with the system interpreter)

[23:37:07] <SnoopJ> sveinse, yes, it's more fruitful to discuss things first before diving right into writing a PEP

[23:38:07] <exarkun> sveinse: sure.  "write a pep" is not the same as "have a pep accepted".
[23:38:25] <ChrisWarrick> that quite sveinse posted sounds very welcoming
[23:38:28] <sveinse> yeah, informal as it is. Do you like the idea?
[23:38:44] <ChrisWarrick> so perhaps you should not attack every idea with "write a pep"

[23:39:21] <SnoopJ> not a particularly helpful thing to say
[23:39:31] <bjs> sveinse: you don't need the "tribal language",  I mean if you have a good idea someone will sponsor it.  Lots of things start as informal discussions, then become mailing list or discourse discussions before eventually the idea gets written down concretely
[23:39:35] <bjs> as a PEP
[23:40:01] <SnoopJ> yea, think of the PEP as more of a formalization of the discussion which generally was happening before the PEP existed
[23:40:13] <bjs> and PEPs often go through iterations,  many of the PEPs that get accepted aren't exactly what the original suggestion was
[23:40:31] <KirkMcDonald> python-ideas is not the worst place to start that kind of discussion.
[23:40:34] <bjs> notably the recent pattern matching PEP got completely discarded and rewritten from scratch as a new PEP because it changed so much during the discussions

[23:42:59] <bjs> sveinse: if you want something specific about your specific idea, then I think you're likely to get some fairly obvious follow-up questions about whether this applies just to `for` but to `async for` as well, and whether it'd be useful for any other control flow mechanisms
[23:43:02] *** Joins: tj1345 (~tj1345@cpe-75-185-104-199.cinci.res.rr.com)
[23:43:11] <bjs> and whether it should be just that particular style or any comprehension-like thing
[23:43:28] <sveinse> bjs: thanks
[23:43:44] <SnoopJ> this particular syntax probably also needs to think about more complicated expressions that might contain parse ambiguities
[23:44:32] <sveinse> There aren't any async comprehensions, right?
[23:45:09] <bjs> sveinse: there are.
[23:45:16] <KirkMcDonald> I would immediately have to think of conditional expressions, but mostly with the parsing I think you can lean on "just do whatever comprehensions do."
[23:45:33] <bjs> SnoopJ: I don't think there'll be any, as if there would be they'd be in normal comprehensions too
[23:45:43] <SnoopJ> yea I *think* the things I'm thinking of are largely ternary expressions and should be distinguishable (to the parser, at least)
[23:45:45] <KirkMcDonald> Like, the only case that comes immediately to mind is: `for x in foo if blah else bar:`
[23:45:53] <sveinse> a = (x async for x in y if cond) ?
[23:46:04] <bjs> sveinse: yep, that's an async comprehension
[23:46:45] <bjs> you get the normal set, generator/list/set/dict
[23:46:48] <sveinse> And in this operation, the if test must be sync, correct?
[23:46:50] <bjs> but with `async for`

[23:47:12] <bjs> sveinse: nope
[23:47:34] <sveinse> bjs: oh, cool. Evidently never tries async comprehension
[23:48:00] *** Joins: mrhands (~hands@user/mrhands)
[23:48:00] <Wooble> sveinse: see PEP 530; they have a ton of examples.
[23:48:47] <sveinse> a = (x async for x in y if cond(x))  and cond() is a coroutine?
[23:49:04] <sveinse> Wooble: thanks
[23:49:05] <Wooble> sveinse: you'd have to await it
[23:49:12] <bjs> sveinse: `if await cond(x)` if cond is a coroutine function
[23:49:25] <sveinse> got it
[23:49:27] <bjs> you can also have `if await cond(x)` in non-async comprehensions
[23:49:41] *** Joins: bluedust_ (~bluedust@185.248.85.10)
[23:49:56] <bjs> So presumably you want to allow `for x in y if await cond(x): ...` too :)
[23:51:02] <sveinse> In that context, to your comment bjs, I'd say the `for ... in ... if` statement should follow the same rules as comprehension (and async comprehensions), I would think.
[23:51:35] *** Quits: Elodin (~elodin@user/elodin) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:51:43] <bjs> sveinse: so can I have `for y in z await if cond(y) for x in y: ...` :)
[23:51:56] <bjs> oops `if await cond(y)` * sorry
[23:52:24] <phox> sveinse: if you want it async you can pack the cond() into the result, and switch on that when you unpack the results
[23:52:47] <phox> (cond(x),x) async for ....
