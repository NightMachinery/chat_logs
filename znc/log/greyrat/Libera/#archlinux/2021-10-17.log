[00:23:39] <A17> MrAureliusR: hello.
[00:24:05] <MrAureliusR> is there a way to track package updates over time? I was thinking I could just redirect pacman -Syu to a text file or something, but it'd be nice to have a tool that keeps track of what packages were updated, and when, to which version, etc.
[00:24:19] <MrAureliusR> I'm not even sure what it would be called -- package update audit logs or something?
[00:24:37] <brocellous> that's what your pacman.log is for?
[00:25:28] <MrAureliusR> oh, nice
[00:25:33] <MrAureliusR> did not think to check for that
[00:25:47] <MrAureliusR> I wonder if there are any tools to parse it and give a nice neat GUI or something

[01:06:15] <A17_> I have an rpi 3b+ that I wish to use as a stream box for a non-smart TV. The rpi, while being great for it's intended uses, does not have the required power to run a browser and stream content. I'm thinking I could probably do this using my server. In fact, I know I can for sure using my knowledge of virtual machines and simply remoting into it from the rpi, but I'm wondering if, since everything is running on Arch now (or less specifically, 
[01:06:16] <A17_> since everything is running on linux now) if there is a more efficient/better way to do this. Since linux allows multi-seat by default, could it be as simple as logging in with a dedicated user and forwarding an X11 session? I don't want X to init by default as it's a headless unit, but I suppose that setting up base X and a DE with no login manager and not enabling the service could work. Thoughts?

[02:10:40] <sheep> did you override AddKeysToAgent for any specific hosts?
[02:10:56] <dragestil> no
[02:11:18] <grawity> ssh_config is a "first match wins" format, so defaults (Host *) should typically be at the end
[02:11:25] <sheep> the order shouldn't matter then. Are you using ssh-agent, gpg-agent, or some other agent?
[02:11:35] <grawity> does `ssh -G foo` report addkeystoagent correctly?
[02:12:01] <dragestil> i'm using ssh-agent for ssh and gpg-agent for gpg, but they have different keys
[02:12:32] <dragestil> grawity: yes it does

[02:19:09] <dragestil> hmm it looks like ssh-agent is not "active" on this specific terminal. when i do ssh-add -l i get Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory, but if I open a new terminal the key seems to be cached ok. i do have a few lines in bashrc to keep on ssh-agent alive

[06:28:51] <A17_> johnjay: the answer to that will always be "the wiki" but depending on what you want to do will depend on which part of the wiki. Installing and setting up arch? You want the installation guide. Otherwise search engine queries for "cool things to do with linux" or let us know if you had something more specific in mind and we might be able to point your in the right direction to get you started with what you're wanting to achieve.

[07:29:40] <striking> `touch /mnt/FileShare/SteamLibraryLinux/steamapps/common/Into\ the\ Breach/test` worked fine
[07:29:51] <A17_> So I installed a package succesfully from the AUR earlier. I know it was successful because I am able to use it's contents. The repo was https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nerd-fonts-complete/
[07:29:52] <phrik> Title: AUR (en) - nerd-fonts-complete (at aur.archlinux.org)

[07:31:00] <sheep> the AUR deals with source packages, which could build multiple packages
[07:31:00] <Scimmia> A17_: pacman -Qs nerd
[07:31:10] <A17_> I have no idea, keep in mind, this is maybe the third AUR package I've installed

[07:32:19] <A17_> `makepkg -sirc`
[07:33:06] <A17_> Scimmia: Not sure how I have access to the fonts then. The only thing I've done related to them is git clone the repo, check the PKGBUILD, and makepkg -sirc
[07:33:41] <Scimmia> most of the time when we see this, it's because the sudo prompt timed out and it never installed
[07:34:39] <Scimmia> see your pacman log as well, if it installed, it will be in ther
[07:34:40] <Scimmia> there
[07:35:03] <A17_> I'll check

[07:37:26] <kevr> it installs via pacman
[07:37:40] <Scimmia> all -i does is call pacman
[07:37:43] <A17_> right, I just wasn't sure if it would log it being invoked by another process
[07:37:59] <kevr> that info is irrelevant
[07:38:19] <A17_> It would be very relevant if it didnt...
[07:38:20] <A17_> anyways
[07:38:30] <A17_> there is not reference to it being installed in pacman.log
[07:38:32] <A17_> no*
[07:39:25] <A17_> there is, however, a tar.gz, so we're back to what you said then Scimmia?
[07:39:40] <A17_> must have let it built but missed a prompt to authenticate for the pacman install

[07:39:55] <A17_> *shrug*
[07:39:57] <Scimmia> it should be .pkg.tar.*, but yeah
[07:40:56] <A17_> yea no pkg file either
[07:41:14] <Scimmia> so maybe it failed to even make the package
[07:41:58] <A17_> which leads me back to, how am I using a font that was never installed, or MAYBE I'm not, and I've confused myself

[10:58:55] <johnjay> ok. hello fellow arch user
[10:58:55] <specunix> who would have guessed
[10:58:56] <bugs> I have arch installed on my ssd and I have 1TB internal HDD plugged in. I want to wipe the HDD and install new File System, 
[10:59:22] <bugs> I want to setup ZFS file system. All I want to do is .. keep some movies TV shows in long term in that HDD.
[10:59:47] <bugs> but I am confused is ZFS is fine ? or it doesn't support on linux? 
[10:59:58] <bugs> Should I go with btrfs? 
[11:00:06] <specunix> I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate, but from what I've heard, ZFS kinda sucks if you don't have ECC ram

[11:09:46] <johnjay> best i could tell is *all* forms of digital media are very short-lived and temporary
[11:09:50] <johnjay> or else untested.
[11:10:27] <specunix> well I guess that's why people should have backups
[11:10:49] <johnjay> well sure. but if you have 1 backup... how do you resolve a flipped bit
[11:10:56] <demonicmaniac> just rewrite it

[11:11:11] <demonicmaniac> digital just loses charge or magnetism

[11:11:20] <specunix> johnjay: fair enough I guess
[11:11:24] <demonicmaniac> that is resolved by rewriting it every year

[23:27:17] <drocan> exactly, any old chump can publish a package on aur
[23:27:43] <marcello42> yes that is my concern would be great to have snap in the community repo :D

[23:33:29] <SysGhost> I usually see it this way: 1: Package not in the main repos? Not important enough for majority of Arch users then. 2: Not in the AUR? Then it's not important to a minor number of users either as no one bothered pick it up and make a MAKEPKG file for it. 3: No  one even mentions it not being in the AUR? Then literally no one ever needs it under Arch. (except for a few very exotic cases at best))

[23:43:56] <marcello42> I'd rather go build it from source though but I am not that comfortable with compiling go programs yet
[23:44:08] <SysGhost> most stuff that isn't in the main repos usually are found in the AUR
[23:44:23] <marcello42> but it is the very first time I use the AUR and hope I learn something from the PKGBUILD script :)

[23:45:03] <marcello42> yes, my main question is more how to best check if the script is trustworthy :)
[23:45:57] <SysGhost> marcello42: you can download the makepkg file, edit it make the minor changes you need (such as changing the git sources), and then run makepkg on it. It is essentially the same as manually doing it with make config , make and make install

[23:46:53] <Namarrgon> if you already know how to build it from source then verifying the PKGBUILD shouldn't be hard

[23:47:49] <SysGhost> the difference is that it builds it in a sandbox, packs it up and then you have a pacman-compatible package.
[23:48:25] <Namarrgon> makepkg doesn't use a sandbox

[23:49:27] <SysGhost> well.. whatever it is.
[23:49:33] <susi> my / is on LVM so no point in slimmin initrd :/ do you think btrfs subvolumes are good enough replacement?
[23:50:41] <marcello42> replacing the LVM will mean moving everything and rebuild the partition table, BTRFS is a FS LVM a container
[23:51:12] <susi> I know :)
[23:51:24] <marcello42> the question is what filesystem is on your LVM for /
[23:51:31] <susi> but for the future info, plus I'm building another fresh Arch
[23:51:59] <marcello42> if you go for BTRFS I not really see any benefit with LVM if you are going to use one drive
[23:52:26] <susi> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mkinitcpio/Minimal_initramfs says that if my "LVM assembly" contains / partition, can't get rid of "udev" dependency
[23:52:27] <phrik> Title: mkinitcpio/Minimal initramfs - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[23:52:54] <susi> yeah, the point is, that I've been thinking about going from ext4+LVM to btrfs
[23:53:16] <af> lol socat /dev/zero UDP:1.1.1.1:53 totally fucks up my entire network
[23:53:25] <marcello42> generally speaking LVM adds another layer of abstraction. That being said if you do not need LVM better not go for it imho

[23:53:49] *** Joins: alx741 (~alx741@186.178.108.68)
[23:54:10] <marcello42> you should compare ext4 with btrfs rather than taking LVM into account here :)
[23:54:33] <susi> marcello42: but what could be a situation, where I would need LVM?
[23:54:53] <susi> that I couldn't achieve things with btrfs features like subvolumes
[23:55:11] *** Quits: Managor (~managor@df7-zcybv7y82vk9px70t-3.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:55:14] <marcello42> several.. if you want encryption with multiple partitions for instance it is easier to encrypt the lvm container than each partition 
[23:55:36] <marcello42> well this you could also archive with sus 
[23:56:03] <susi> oh rite, but wouldn't anyone want whole-system encryption, or at least everything but /boot
[23:56:11] <marcello42> LVM shines with handling multiple drives and easy resizing partitions and pools
[23:56:37] <marcello42> yes this is why LVM is used to encrypt all volumes 
[23:56:37] <susi> I don't need resizing, I just pick the right values at the beginning :-)
[23:56:49] <susi> and never add external disks to the main assembly
[23:57:03] <marcello42> with subvolumes you do not need to care abour resizing anyway if you want to use btrfs on all folders
[23:57:31] <SysGhost> resizing? Hah. one huge drive for /, and another huge drive for /home. Maybe a separate partition for /boot but that's about it =)
[23:57:39] <marcello42> then go for btrfs but be careful to read the wiki, btrfs needs to be loaded before mounting 
[23:57:57] <susi> SysGhost: you have encrypted / and /home separately?
[23:58:04] <SysGhost> indeed
[23:58:07] <marcello42> I have all on one SysGhost :) I run subvolumes 
[23:58:27] <susi> even /boot?
[23:58:33] <marcello42> nah :)

[23:58:44] <SysGhost> nope. /boot is left unecrypted for easier uefi managing
[23:58:55] <marcello42> 512MB for the EFI rest is for everything else
[23:59:00] <SysGhost> if they want the kernel. they cna have it
[23:59:19] <susi> but how do you know you are not running NSA-sponsored modified kernel rn?
[23:59:36] <marcello42> but running updates ;)
[23:59:50] <marcello42> kenerl gets overwritten after each update entirely 
[23:59:56] <SysGhost> susi: I ... *uuuh*.... trust the Arch?
