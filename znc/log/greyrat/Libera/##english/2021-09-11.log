[00:03:10] <blkshp> Why would it be unintentional?

[00:25:51] <TechTest> I find that very uncomfortable
[00:26:09] <huf> so is your keyboard pulled to the edge?
[00:26:11] <TechTest> and it adds a lot of pressure on the nerve that's swallen

[00:26:17] <huf> huh
[00:26:20] <huf> weeeeeeird
[00:26:32] <TechTest> I thought that was the norm
[00:26:40] <huf> mine's pushed back so the edge of the table is just below my elbows
[00:27:18] <TechTest> that would make the edge of the table to add pressure right where damaged nerve is

Something that produces the jet or current in the previous sense, such as a syringe., 3. (obsolete) A jet or spray of any liquid., 4.

[01:10:51] <huf> sorry, hoist.
[01:11:12] <GuiToris> there are things that cannot be forgiven

[01:22:05] <huf> so a dictionary not having it is no big deal

[01:43:21] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: Try setting it to play at ½ or ¼ speed
[01:43:22] <GuiToris> TimMc, yes, I even cheated, I used english subtitles, but I didn't pause it, and it was so fast, I couldn't read every single word
[01:43:28] <huf> and I wasnt that young, like 16? 17? when I was in germany
[01:43:56] <blkshp> I've used 32 audible credits in 6 months lol
[01:44:23] <huf> and my internal noise cancelling thingie is pretty bad 
[01:44:32] <huf> much worse than average
[01:44:34] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, I actually started doing this, but not with movies yet, it would take a long time
[01:44:42] <huf> based on experiences in pubs and clubs :D
[01:46:01] <GuiToris> blkshp, oh and beside all of these, I didn't realized there were English actors in the movie
[01:46:18] <GuiToris> I usually recognize British English quite easily
[01:46:19] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: I long ago figured that literacy is, in neurological terms, a form of bilingualism. So to read&write and99,99 listen &speak a second language is like learning two new languages (though admittedly similar ones)

[01:49:22] <kurahaupo> Information conveyed by timing or tone is completely lost in writing, so we adopt other conventions, which are often interpreted as "more formal register" but it's more fundamental; we need to make up for stuff that can't be conveyed

[02:15:27] <blkshp> GuiToris: what do you mean?
[02:15:40] <huf> apparently we've phased out the 500 note?

[04:09:20] <GuiToris> that's awkward!
[04:10:21] <GuiToris> well actually it can be either one, they shook hands and made up/out

[04:11:27] <GuiToris> I learned a lot today
[04:11:27] <blkshp> Well if a brother and sister had a fight and made out to fix it that would be deeply inappropriate.
[04:12:09] <GuiToris> it would be even more inappropriate if the two brothers made out
[04:12:44] <blkshp> Some might say it would be the same level of inappropriate.

[12:58:31] <Rashad> controversial topic: should we capitalize the first letter of the sentence and use a dot at the end of it in chat?
[12:58:52] <blkshp> Yes.
[12:59:08] <Rashad> why?
[12:59:12] <blkshp> Why not?
[12:59:18] <huf> pet peeve of blkshp 
[12:59:28] <Rashad> I heard someone say it is wrong
[12:59:34] <blkshp> It is not wrong.
[12:59:35] <Rashad> he said it is not a real sentence or something like that
[12:59:40] <blkshp> That's bullshit.
[12:59:45] <huf> yeah, that *is* weird
[13:00:01] <Rashad> to be fair I don't remember the exact argument
[13:00:03] <blkshp> People have got into the habit of not using capital letters and proper punctuation.
[13:00:09] <Rashad> so both ways are acceptable? 
[13:00:26] <blkshp> It's annoying. No, both ways are not acceptable. They're common, not acceptable.
[13:00:42] <Rashad> I think subtitles in movies capitalize the first letter but don't use a dot at the end?
[13:01:31] <Rashad> Oh I see.
[13:01:40] <blkshp> See what you have asked there is whether we think that you think that subtitles in movies capitalise the first letter. People don't know how to use punctuation anymore which means that sentences are incorrectly written because people have forgotten.
[13:02:11] <huf> people never knew
[13:02:19] <huf> they're far more literate today than they ever were
[13:02:29] <blkshp> I think they new better when everyone actually bothered.
[13:02:33] <huf> nah
[13:02:57] <huf> more people read and write more than they ever did
[13:03:03] <blkshp> Everything was written, properly punctuated letters. There was no texting, no short messages. Or rather there were far fewer than there are now.
[13:03:05] <huf> you're confusing people with elites here
[13:04:09] <blkshp> There is also the fact that many many more people couldn't actually read.
[13:04:14] <Rashad> huf +1
[13:04:14] <huf> this is like saying science was better when scientists were gentlemen because they didnt have to run after grants, forgetting that we were throwing away most of the minds of every generation
[13:04:34] <huf> it's an easy mistake to make because our education system is dogshit
[13:04:41] <Voxel> Indeed, blkshp. Sometimes, it's freaking frustrating to read something like "no stop no its correct what do you think i leave"
[13:05:06] <blkshp> My eye twiched at that xD
[13:05:13] <huf> that's missing commas
[13:05:13] <Rashad> My friend asked me why do people not use proper Arabic (also known as Modern Standard Arabic) in everyday life any more? I told him nobody ever did except the elite, and the elite now speak English.
[13:05:20] <huf> those are actually important
[13:05:35] <Voxel> Of course they are, but they just omit them
[13:05:47] <huf> just like ! and ? are important
[13:05:50] <huf> . a lot less so
[13:06:01] <blkshp> Who are you (and I mean people in general) to determine which is important? 
[13:06:16] <huf> *blink*
[13:06:30] <huf> the end of the line works just as well as a .
[13:06:39] <huf> you dont need an extra separator
[13:06:48] <blkshp> Pressing enter at the end of a sentence is not acceptable either.
[13:06:59] <blkshp> Not if there's another sentence like this.
[13:06:59] <huf> wow, it isnt?

[13:10:36] <blkshp> But I don't find it important enough not to share my scotch :)

[13:12:45] <huf> Rashad: was MSA ever the spoken dialect of anyone, or was it a somewhat constructed register even when it got started?
[13:14:03] <huf> ah, it's just the quran's arabic with a facelift
[13:14:10] <huf> so pretty old then

[13:18:31] <Rashad> huf In the past at least the elite spoke only MSA (but actually Standard Arabic)
[13:18:42] <Rashad> More or less the same thing.
[13:18:55] <Rashad> The same rules, etc, just some words went out of fashion and vice versa. 
[13:19:14] <Rashad> The Quran is 100% compatible with MSA and vice versa. 
[13:20:19] <Rashad> Some poetry from 1,000 years ago is very hard to read, because of the vocabulary. 
[13:20:58] <Rashad> For example, the word for the bowl which you put wine into was "ziq". I've never seen a ziq and never heard that word in my life.
[13:21:03] <Rashad> But it does appear in poetry. 
[13:21:48] <Rashad> With time dialects appeared and now we speak those in everyday life. 
[13:26:02] <huf> there were probably dialects from almost the start, as people who formerly spoke something else learned arabic
[13:26:08] <huf> during/after the expansion
[13:26:37] <Rashad> Yes.
[13:26:51] <Rashad> In fact "Standard Arabic" is just what the people in Mecca spoke. 
[13:27:44] <Rashad> There is a saying from Muhammad where people from a further part of Arabia approached him and asked him about the rule for fasting while travelling...
[13:28:10] <Rashad> but these people used "Am" instead of "Al" for "The".
[13:28:20] <Rashad> So he answered them back using Am instead of Al.
[13:28:35] <Rashad> "ليس امبر امصيام في امسفر"
[13:29:08] <huf> cool
[13:29:10] <Rashad> "Fasting while traveling is not a virtue."

[15:56:05] <twb> no_gravity: both sentences are valid
[15:56:31] <no_gravity> twb: Great. What would the second one mean to you?
[15:57:29] <twb> That you were either forging a copy of that specific painting, or you were trying to do a similarly "great" work.
[15:57:43] <twb> Probably the former because you said "the" not "a"
[15:57:56] <twb> In the latter sense, you might also say "my magnum opus" – your great(est) work
[15:58:14] <no_gravity> twb: I see. From reading around the net, I get the feeling that "Do somebody" also could mean having sex with somebody?
[16:01:48] <twb> yes

[16:04:16] <twb> I dunno, it just made me think of it
[16:04:24] <no_gravity> I see
[16:04:48] <no_gravity> So "To do the Mona Lisa" could mean to paint the Mona Lisa or to have sex with the Mona Lisa.
[16:06:42] <twb> no_gravity: I wouldn't read it that way without more context to establish, say, a painting fetishist
[16:07:51] <no_gravity> twb: Yeah. I just wanted to make sure I understand the possible conotations correctly.
[16:08:56] <twb> almost anything can be sexual if you want it to be

[22:10:17] <kurahaupo> Voxel: it's grammatical, yes, but without context I can't tell if it matches your intentions
[22:11:24] <kurahaupo> Voxel: is it a suggestion for an outline of a procedure for testing programs?

[22:12:13] <Voxel> Indeed. The purpose of the sentence is to suggest a procedure to test a program.

[22:35:58] <twb> "Some might suggest" is wishy-washy
[22:36:02] <kurahaupo> Voxel: The problem with using "general" is the "a general X test" may by parsed as either  "a [general X] test" or "a general [X test]" depending on what you put for X. "a general stations test" cf "a general sobriety test".
[22:36:03] <kurahaupo> But in some cases you can parse it both ways and come out with the same meaning either way "a general fitness-test" and "a general-fitness test" are pretty much the same
[22:37:08] <twb> It looks like CrystalDiskInfo is proprietary software, so *I* certainly wouldn't use it
[22:37:09] <kurahaupo> A term like "general purpose" doesn't suffer that ambiguity
[22:37:27] <kurahaupo> Does it run on Linux?
[22:37:32] <twb> It looks like it's for Windows.  Surely Windows already performs periodic SMART self-tests?
[22:38:10] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrystalDiskMark  ah it's open source.  The first few quack results were misleading.
[22:39:18] <twb> Personally I use smartmontools for AHCI disks.

[22:42:32] <roo-> It would probably sound weird, but is this the correct usage of "replaced by"? ... "Have I been replaced by a new stalker?"
[22:42:52] <twb> Looks OK to me
[22:43:17] <roo-> Is it also acceptable to change it to "replaced with"?
[22:43:26] <twb> yes
[22:43:44] <twb> in some cases you might need "with" or "by", but either look OK to me there
[22:43:56] <roo-> I see, thanks
[22:44:19] <twb> "In 1400 the King was replaced by an Allthing"
[22:44:57] <twb> "In 1400 the King was replaced with an Allthing"
[22:45:03] <twb> Hrm, both sound OK there as well
[22:45:26] <twb> "by" is clearer, because "with" could also mean "using"
[22:46:34] <roo-> Also, I don't suppose there's a replacement to 'stalker' which doesn't involve with a negative connotation/harassment?
[22:47:15] <twb> roo-: what primary sense do you want to convey?
[22:47:32] <twb> Do you venture into the exclusion zone to find artefacts of power?
[22:48:31] <roo-> So far we've been using the term 'stalker' to describe one player following another in a game, I don't suppose there's a better/cuter way to describe it than stalker?
[22:49:18] <twb> "understudy", "backup"
[22:49:38] <roo-> Not quite that
