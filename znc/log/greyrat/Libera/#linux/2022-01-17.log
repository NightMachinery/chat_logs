[00:31:28] <mrfb> the problem is that texted communication lacks tone of voice, which tends to translate on missread signals about what's harsh, what's not, and whatever
[00:31:42] <spinningCat> hexnewbie,   cd CatPics && find -maxdepth 20 -mindepth 20 -type f -printf '%T@\t%P\0' | sort -zn | cut -zf2- |  rename 'image'-i --nono -v -e 'our $i; $_=$_.$i++'
[00:31:43] <evilop> hexnewbie: when you got so much that losing a large portion doesn't matter
[00:31:50] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: Well, for one thing some greyhair can't up and decide you only own 80% of what you did yesterday
[00:31:52] <spinningCat> does that work?
[00:32:06] <djph> Dagmar: maybe the problem is that windows keeps trying to boot, and he doesn't want that anymore?
[00:32:07] <Guest97> This laptop doesn' always display what itype.

[00:33:01] <Dagmar> djph: Then perhaps a light snack and some helpful words of encouragement will change its mind
[00:33:05] <ncuxo> what was the way to restart just one PCIe card on the server without restarting the whole server
[00:33:20] <ncuxo> I've watched it in a video somewhere and couldn't find it online
[00:33:31] <Dagmar> ncuxo: Open the case, cross your fingers, and hotplug the card.
[00:33:32] <hexnewbie> spinningCat: No. I don't know about the change to the depth (I doubt you have 20 levels of it), but the -e expression is the one that sets the filename. You probably want like -e 'our $i; $_="image".$i++;'
[00:33:35] <ayecee> ncuxo: feels like it involved sysfs and a file named remove
[00:33:59] <hexnewbie> spinningCat: --nono -v only prints the changes without renaming. ANd that only works for perl rename (called 'rename' in Debian)

[00:37:55] <ayecee> Guest97: what problem did it develop
[00:37:58] <Dagmar> ncuxo: THer'es literally a /sys interface you shove a 1 into to make it happen, but depending on _why_ you're needing to reset a device, it's probably _not_ going to work

[00:42:37] <Guest97> yes and thats when the problems started.
[00:42:41] <TheGuestMovie> yeah that's true. But I prefer imperative for dumb scripts like that because it's easier to debug. And you have the intermediate result of each step (if you took care to put it all in a different variable). You can print it at anytime, can step through in a debugger, etc. My rule is, unless there's a performance need, code should read like a series

[04:43:49] <Dagmar> An easy-mode check would be to `su - opendkim -c /bin/bash` and roleplay as opendkim
[04:43:56] <tirnanog> ayecee: that's an interesting thought. a systemctl cat of the relevant units might not go amiss to rule it in or out.
[04:44:05] <Dagmar> rockworld: Yes, that's where the sshd_config entries I posted about earlier come into play
[04:44:20] <ayecee> i don't actually know if private run directories are a thing
[04:44:24] <Dagmar> rockworld: You can make those directives apply for one user, or many users, or a group or whatever
[04:44:40] <kurahaupo> rockworld: You can specify in authorized_keys that particular keys must run certain commands or subsystems
[04:44:48] <Dagmar> rockworld: If you try to use ~/.ssh/authorized_keys the user will be able to change that and disable it
[04:45:07] <catbeard> does opendkim.service have like any Private* options in it's systemd unit file?
[04:45:13] <Bilge-> Apparently postfix is chrooted so that's why it will never work I guess
[04:45:23] <catbeard> or postfix.service yeah
[04:45:32] <Dagmar> No, it means you need to specify the path relative to where it's chrooted
[04:45:38] <catbeard> might be different run namespace, exactly Dagmar
[04:45:44] <rockworld> I need to find a example configuration only for one specific user instead of a group
[04:45:49] <Bilge-> Right, but opendkim cannot create a socket inside postfix's chroot
[04:45:52] <kurahaupo> rockworld: I assume that when you say "prevent access to terminal" you mean "prevent running a shell or commands"
[04:45:57] <ayecee> where is it chrooted to?
[04:46:06] <rockworld> kurahaupo: exactly that
[04:46:18] <Dagmar> postfix doesn't use namespaces unless someone' lost their mind and decided it needed to be far more complex than necessary
[04:46:23] <Bilge-> /var/spool/postfix as far as I can make out, but I don't really know since it's not in its config or anything so I guess it's just chrooted by default
[04:46:23] <Dagmar> If that's the case, make _them_ fix this problem
[04:46:34] <kurahaupo> rockworld: ssh doesn't need a terminal to run commands

[05:18:01] <Dagmar> I wholeheartedly support making mail delivery someone else's problem

[05:18:43] <mlu> taking the example of cyrus-imapd, what'd you do is that you'd tell your MTA to use a special cyrus MDA to put things in the place cryus expects
[05:18:44] <Dagmar> Well, they're important because they give us nice, clearly defined lines along which to draw our restrictions
[05:19:18] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83)
[05:19:22] <mlu> I think those lines are quite arbitrary and idiosyncratic

[05:19:57] <Dagmar> Those lines are neither "arbitrary" nor are they "idiosyncratic"

[05:20:30] <Dagmar> No, it didn't.
[05:20:31] <mlu> so of course, involving fetchmail and procmail would be terrifying

[05:22:02] <Dagmar> Under the "all one piece" service model, if you managed to compromise the mail daemon listening on 25/tcp, you could then pretty much write to anywhere as any user

[05:22:21] <mlu> yep, I remembered the WIZARD command :)
[05:22:49] <Dagmar> Under what's being done _now_ it'll mean you can write to the incoming and outgoing queue directories as that restricted userid, and perhaps mildly annoy the MDA by repeatedly poking it
[05:23:05] <mlu> I think it's important to state: do we consider having emails as files in a standard location as the standard?

The malware, since named SysJoker, was later discovered to also have Mac and Windows-based variations, increasing its ability to infect desired systems. The macOS and Linux variations are currently undetectable by most antivirus products and scanners.

[09:33:37] <itt788> i started a document like this "\node at (0,0) (image1) [box, right] {\includegraphics[height=4cm]{boy.png}}"
[09:33:38] <sudomann> sheep, makes perfect sense, thanks
[09:33:38] <mlu> if you don't become a professor or math teacher, you're working as a cryptographer for the NSA
[09:33:58] <mlu> EdFletcher: it was getting to expensive for EADS to continue supporting
[09:34:00] <labrador_> mlu, wait really?
[09:34:03] <labrador_> thats insane
[09:34:04] <itt788> and "(\linewidth,0) node (image2) [box, left] {\includegraphics[height=4cm]{boy2.png}};"
[09:34:06] <mlu> btw, they made a lot of boneheaded business decisions :P
[09:34:12] <mlu> the A380 was one of them
[09:34:17] <itt788> how can i change the (0,0) and (\linewith,0) so that by repeating this code lualatex append the additional images or creates a new page?
[09:34:28] <mlu> but hey, I hope they helped with European pride?
[09:34:38] <itt788> s/append/appends
[09:34:48] <EdFletcher> mlu: oh yeah, that thing was _so_ expensive to build & maintain. even with the crazy ticket costs i thought they never really made money on them right? was always subsidized by the UK & French gov'ts
[09:35:01] <mlu> it was actaully quite profitable with the airlines
[09:35:10] <EdFletcher> oh what!? well crap, what the hell
[09:35:15] <mlu> since people would pay $10k for a 3.5hr transatlantic crossing
[09:35:25] <EdFletcher> yeah great point
[09:35:39] <mlu> but maintaning support was difficult, so EADS stopped support (ie. no more parts for maintenance) and the Concorde was forced into retirement
[09:36:24] *** Quits: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[09:36:36] <mlu> I think there's a real market for a supersonic business jet: the people who'd pay the $10k usually preferred to fly private anyways, and they are money-rich time-poor
[09:36:37] <EdFletcher> ahhhh so that's what eventually got it, makes sense. still such a shame. will never get to fly on one 😦 (probably wouldn't have anyway, but at least there was the possibility)
[09:36:52] <mlu> it'll just be a matter of time before a replacement happens, even if it's a tiny jet
[09:37:17] <mlu> until then, you can maybe pay for a ticket abroad a MiG-22
[09:37:18] <EdFletcher> mlu: true but those folks don't seem motivated to actually build the aircraft, they just want someone else (who?) to build & maintain them so they can use them. big gap there.
[09:37:43] <EdFletcher> mlu: but yeah agreed, i definitely can't see a future in which they don't return in some guise (the little private ones make the most sense)
[09:38:22] <mlu> keep your eyes glued on the Boom Overture
[09:38:32] <mlu> Aerion SBJ came close, but they ran out of money and folded
[09:38:41] <mlu> but they already even had orders from United and NetJets
[09:39:07] <EdFletcher> haha yeah i've been watching that space for awhile but they all seem to run out of money way too early. hopeful for Boom, but not optimistic.
[09:39:43] <mlu> same here
[09:40:00] <mlu> now, about cargo blimps... :P

[10:10:04] <gabriel> Growing up is hard :/
[10:10:19] <mlu> gabriel: lemme ask you this: why is it hard right now?
[10:10:28] <mlu> because I've seen some people with college experiences that genuinely suck
[10:10:39] <mlu> if you have to pay for it and work part time, that genuinely sucks
[10:10:58] <gabriel> I am doing good overall rightnow. I am just getting pounded homework.
[10:11:07] <mlu> oh heh, the homework part always sucks
[10:11:27] <mlu> don't miss the homework, although even the heaviest load classes seemed lightweight compared to IRL work
[10:11:39] <mlu> but that's because I chose to do a startup, and I chose something that I'm very passionate about
[10:11:54] <gabriel> You did a startup??
[10:11:55] <mlu> I learned in college that although I was good at math, I hated it
[10:12:07] <mlu> gabriel: yeah -- got lucky, met a co-founder, and did a startup
[10:12:13] <mlu> we're now about 30 people or so
[10:12:19] <gabriel> That's awesome
[10:12:34] <mlu> I'll say this: there's so many things I wish I'd do different though
[10:12:40] <gabriel> like what??
[10:12:49] <mlu> raise money from customers, not VCs
[10:13:00] <Sauvin> What's a VC?
[10:13:03] <gabriel> ^^^^
[10:13:12] <mlu> oh oops, VC = venture capitalist
[10:13:16] <Sauvin> Ah, thanks.
[10:13:24] <mlu> they give you a bunch of money to experiment with high-risk ideas in exchange for a percentage of ownership
[10:13:46] <mlu> while you may get paid in the short term, you also have too little feedback on what you're doing right or wrong
[10:13:52] <mlu> and if you run out of money, it becomes quite insufferable
[10:14:00] <gabriel> what do you do at your startup???
[10:14:12] <mlu> that money may seem addictive, but you're not building a "real" business unless you raise from your customers
[10:14:26] <mlu> oh, it's just this tool that helps people build mobile websites without code
[10:14:48] <mlu> (psst: actually executing well matters ;)

[12:31:48] <Nobrem> and they all need the right timestamp  (e.g.  1 Hour,  2 Hours, etc.)
[12:31:59] <Nobrem> doing this in the command line is just be best option, I guess
[12:32:26] <Nobrem> once all the parts of the video have gotten the right timestamps imprinted, I can edit them in a GUI as I see fit without loosing the timestamps

[13:22:19] <Gaboradon> One of the guys here told me the good thing is, prior when FAT32 was detected and when Testdisk "fixed", the numbers are the same for location:  1 P FAT32      0  32 33 121601  57 56 1953521664
[13:22:19] <NyB> Gaboradon: it might help if you provided more info on what happened. Physical damage? Or did someone format/reuse the disk?

[13:25:16] <Gaboradon> NyB: Oh there are some things that could make this thing easier, I know exactly what caused the corruption, the drive is recent, a couple of years old, like 2016 or 17, it was the 2011 level samsung smart HDTV which creates an XFS parition, I was transferring from TV via FTP server some files and managing things, simultaneously i used TV's media browser to clean some files out after transfer, but I should have turned off the TV and closed handles to
[13:25:18] <Gaboradon> the FS and files, it's when I deleted like 10 files, I came back to see an error "Filesystem cannot be recognized" or something
[13:25:41] <Gaboradon> I think the bug is repeatable, but didn't try yet.
[13:26:46] <Gaboradon> NyB: Secondly, there's only 5 filetypes the TV writes in this case, so only 5 types of signatures to look for when recovering files, and filenames are very standard, just basically a time code,  YYYY-MM-DD_01.mdb  .xml etc
[13:26:55] <euouae> that's weird

[13:29:40] <Gaboradon> The thing is, it shouldn't have happened, frist I made a bad choice to transfer it directly via TV, the TV does not have gigabit ethernet port so it's 8 MB/s max but I wasn't pressed for time, I could have hooked up the media HDD to my PC and transfer the files that way.
[13:29:45] <mncheckm> is it possible for ipp for a printer to report job-state completed but output nothing on the tray? it's a 2 page document
[13:30:24] <bindi> well i just installed a .deb from the internet for my r8125 as the build was failing and couldn't get it to work, there wasn't an actual error anymore at one point, as far as i could tell

[13:30:55] <Gaboradon>  I wasn't transferring any files and the program that does it has closed it's network with the TV's unofficial FTP server (which accesses the media drive on  the USB2) so but I had the media browser on the TV opened during all of the transfer, must have had some outdated info that should have to be refreshed before it commited deleting.

[13:32:09] <Gaboradon> Samsung TV has it's own "AllShare" thing for stuff like this but it's based on Samba I think, not sure.

[14:36:52] <labrador> djph, but won't that make all previous signatures I made on documents invalid?

[14:37:07] <mlu> there's quite some logic to decode UTF-8
[14:37:25] <Urchin[emacs]> mlu: UTF-8 uses less space if you're actually using ASCII, but not generally (like if you're storing something east asian, or the like)

[14:37:35] <mlu> yeah, the extension prefixes
[14:37:50] <mlu> heh, and UTF-16 still wasn't good enough for CJK :/

[15:56:31] <m1dnight> Hi all. I have a question about bash. When I co `cd pathwithcaps` but the dir is actually titled "PathWithCaps", the pwd command does not return the right capitalization.
[15:56:50] <m1dnight> It's not really an issue, but vscode complains that I should reopen the dir with the right path capitalization.
[15:56:55] <m1dnight> I don't know how to google this. Any pointers?
[15:57:33] <koollman> not so much about bash, but about case-insensitive filesystems
[15:58:28] <koollman> m1dnight: I suppose this is either windows or mac filesystem ? vscode is probably right
[15:58:55] <m1dnight> oh, right, it's mac
[15:58:56] <koollman> (or rather, it is wrong about it, but the wrongness of case-insensitivity is higher, so that makes it right :) )
[15:58:59] <m1dnight> I honestly didnt think about it.

[16:46:55] <hexnewbie> Anyway, enough of house keeping. Copied the files, installed Solaar (doesn't work, because no system tray in GNOME, but I installed it), tried to update the receiver firmware and the tablet is ready for offline use.

[16:49:04] <hexnewbie> So any program that uses one (my bank signing tool, my wireless mouse battery monitor) does not work in it. There *is* an extension for a system tray, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything for me by having it installed

But still bugs like, sometimes four-finger gestures randomly become three-finger gestures, or an ‘echo’ of a window and its frame from an animation becomes focused and everything else stops working

[16:53:17] <hexnewbie> Or you can't launch applications, because that requires typing, popping up the onscreen keyboard requires clicking the search box, tapping the search box with a finger closes the launcher altogether.
[16:53:18] <jumpArtifact> hexnewbie: I see. Interesting to hear your thoughts, since I haven't actually used Gnome with a touchscreen. I just thought it would fit more at home with one since everything is at least "thumb-sized", and apparently there's even accelerometer support to rotate the screen.
[16:53:33] <fakuve> What is the package for `dhcpd` on Debian?
[16:53:39] <hexnewbie> But that, of course, only happens sometimes.
[16:54:33] <fakuve> is it `isc-dhcp-server` ?
[16:54:34] <hexnewbie> jumpArtifact: Oh, yeah, and the accelerator rotation works for some time, then stops. That leaves your screen upside down (usually), as GNOME has no means to *manually* rotate it (manual features are evil)

[16:57:46] <hexnewbie> Probably because it's accelerometer-rotated, and requires rotation matrix applied on the touchscreen in addition to xrandr, the orientation is omitted from the Displays config not to break something.

[16:58:45] <hexnewbie> Like, if you simply use xrandr to rotate the display, that doesn't rotate the touchscreen, and everything becomes broken. If Displays only uses xrandr (on X), it would have broken the touchscreen, GNOME detects it and doesn't allow you to do it.

[18:27:40] <mort> bash is a shell which implements the bash language which is a superset of the posix shell language and has an interactive mode, zsh is a shell which implements the zsh language which is very similar to the bash language and has an interactive mode

[18:31:00] <djph> mort: in the general sense.  noting of course, that versions matter
[18:31:12] <mort> but there are also advantages to sticking to posix features so that posix systems without bash installed can run your script

[18:32:26] <mort> also, this compatibility thing only applies when actually writing scripts; in interactive use there aren't really any advantages to not using bash-specific features (or zsh-specific features if one is using zsh as the interactive shell)
[18:32:56] <Psi-Jack> mort: Yep. I mentioned earlier, newer versions of bash (mostly, I believe 4.x+), have newer functions not present in older versions, for use of native actual bash functions for scripting work.

[19:14:37] <Psi-Jack> Well, there's plenty of games made with different engines. So, no, people would generally refer to games using unity or other engines if they wanted to be specifically relating around an engine.

[20:54:57] <tirnanog> Duchess: there's nothing to fix. if you want an application to be servicing connections on port 587, configure it correctly then start it.
[20:55:18] <tirnanog> for example, your mail server would need to listen on 0.0.0.0:587 or 92.205.28.224:587.
[20:55:53] <tirnanog> running nc certainly isn't going to make a mail server configure itself.

[21:01:44] <tirnanog> Duchess: ok. so just to be clear, you're not trying to receive mail submissions on port 587, but need to send them out from this particular host? it's important to be clear, because these are two completely different requirements. n.b. if you were running a mail server yourself, you might need to receive connections on port 587.
[21:02:09] <tirnanog> Duchess: but if you're just trying to send messages outbound to some other mailserver, the connection goes in the other direction (and yes, your hosting company could technically be blocking it).

[22:56:59] <quartz> Besides, why does libera chat know my real IP address while I'm using my VPN?
[22:57:04] <gothicserpent> yeah, binding the network interface to the vpn adapter is a good way to prevent any leaks in case the VPN goes down for a moment. just a security advice.
[22:57:30] <gothicserpent> the weechat process is not going through the VPN tunnel.
[22:57:46] <gothicserpent> i use a weechat headless daemon on a linux VM, works fine for me.
[22:58:06] <mlu> usually always a good practice to specify an interface to bind to if you have multiple :)
[22:58:28] <gothicserpent> quartz: you might consider cryptostorm cryptofree as a quick test. it's a free VPN tha goes through France, and you can test if your entire system is borked that way if your VPN isn't tunneling.

[23:30:21] <gothicserpent> lol
[23:30:33] <Psi-Jack> Yet, clearly they do block them, and they do have different policies and restrictions based on the country/origin of the user themselves.
[23:30:46] <hodapp> I certainly wouldn't consider "accessing Netflix from my home IP" to be against Netflix's TOS.

[23:32:00] <Psi-Jack> Very specifically 4.3 🙂
[23:32:32] <gothicserpent> 4.3. You may access Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content. The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan
[23:32:34] <gothicserpent> and is specified on the "Account" page.
[23:32:40] <hodapp> gothicserpent: yeah he's not even reading it
[23:32:43] <mrfb> I guess ignore will do the trick
[23:32:52] <gothicserpent> Psi-Jack: if he uses a VPN server location in the service location, it's permissible.
