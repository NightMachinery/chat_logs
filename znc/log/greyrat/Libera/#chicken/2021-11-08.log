[20:15:51] <ipso-facto> hello. i'm sure this has been asked a million times, but can't find anything on googles.
[20:16:14] <ipso-facto> in gsi i can set! variables that have not been defined
[20:16:32] <ipso-facto> how come? this deviates from r5rs
[20:17:04] <Zipheir> gsi?  Isn't that Gambit or Gerbil?  I can't remember which.
[20:17:14] <ipso-facto> sorry. csi :)
[20:17:32] <ipso-facto> i just tried it at the top level
[20:17:37] <ipso-facto> (set! x 5) works
[20:17:44] <ipso-facto> it throws an error on mit-scheme
[20:18:29] <Zipheir> Yes, that does seem to be an extension, although it's not mentioned in https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions%20to%20the%20standard
[20:19:36] <Zipheir> Gambit also raises an error.
[20:20:03] <Zipheir> ipso-facto: So yes, I agree that's a violation of the R5RS.
[20:21:08] <ipso-facto> i can't find it here either: https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Deviations%20from%20the%20standard
[20:21:18] <jcowan> It's explicitly permitted in R5RS.
[20:21:40] <Zipheir> Where?
[20:22:05] <ipso-facto> jcowan: not sure
[20:22:24] <ipso-facto> see 4.1.6 in r5rs doc
[20:22:33] <Zipheir> R5RS 5.2.1 also has "... it would be an error to perform a set! on an unbound variable."
[20:23:00] <Zipheir> jcowan: I believe you, of course, but I can't find it.
[20:23:20] <jcowan> Well, I'm wrong: set! excludes it.
[20:23:26] <ipso-facto> :)
[20:23:31] <jcowan> (p. 10)
[20:23:48] <Zipheir> jcowan: Thanks.
[20:24:52] <ipso-facto> seems there's no way to turn it off
[20:25:52] <jcowan> No.
[20:26:15] <jcowan> https://docs.scheme.org/surveys/set-undefined-variable/ tells you which Schemes have this feature and which don't.
[20:26:43] <Zipheir> I'll add that to the "Deviations" page if mario-goulart and the other Big Chickens are OK with that.
[20:27:14] <jcowan> The top level is inherently messy.  --Not Matthew Flatt
[20:27:28] <Zipheir> Indeed.
[20:27:33] <jcowan> When it comes to the wiki, be bold.
[20:31:38] <jcowan> http://calculist.blogspot.com/2009/01/fexprs-in-scheme.html is a good, if somewhat tendentious, post on problems with the top level.
[20:32:21] *** Joins: tyeaglet (~tyeaglet@212.58.103.11)
[20:32:23] <jcowan> The URL is misleading: the title is really "Fexprs? In Scheme?"
[20:38:22] <ipso-facto> set! works even inside a function
[20:38:38] <ipso-facto> ie, (define (test) (set! x 3))
[20:43:17] <ipso-facto> my problem is that i have a huge file with a million defines. i load it and then tweak the configuration by setting! variables. so i don't know whether i created a new free variable, or modified an existent one.
[20:43:33] <ipso-facto> any suggestions?
[20:44:15] <ipso-facto> i guess i can check, but oh boy.
[20:44:38] <ipso-facto> oh scheme, it must be love.
[20:49:50] <Zipheir> Solution: Don't use global mutable variables!
[20:50:19] <Zipheir> Parameterize, if you must.
[20:51:20] <Zipheir> Riastradh's naming guideline comes to mind: "Affix asterisks to the beginning and end of a globally mutable variable.  This allows the reader of the program to recognize very easily that it is badly written!"
[20:51:39] <ipso-facto> Zipheir: ha ha ha ...
[20:51:41] <ipso-facto> thanks.
[20:51:49] <ipso-facto> what do you mean by parametrize?
[20:52:10] <Zipheir> ipso-facto: https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Module%20(chicken%20base)#parameters
[20:52:52] <ipso-facto> ah! ok. this looks useful.
[20:53:03] <ipso-facto> it's old code i've inherited. 
[20:53:09] <Zipheir> Ah, yes.
[20:53:59] <ipso-facto> parameters are ideal for this.
[20:54:03] <ipso-facto> thanks!
[20:54:13] <Zipheir> I'm glad to hear it!
[20:54:24] <ipso-facto> yeah, let me see what the bosses say
[20:54:38] <ipso-facto> cheers! 
[20:54:42] <ipso-facto> thank you all.
[20:58:59] <ipso-facto> btw just wanted to say, the more i learn about chicken the more amazed i am. it might be the best software i have ever seen. full stop.
[21:08:51] <mario-goulart> Zipheir: sure. I think that's one of my least favorite "features" of CHICKEN (a dangerous one, I'd say).  However, as I understand it, when the spec says "it is an error" it doesn't necessarily mean that implementations are supposed to raise an error.
[21:11:20] <ipso-facto> mario-goulart: it should be an error as per 1.3.2
[21:12:36] <ipso-facto> mario-goulart: wait! no. you're right.
[21:12:42] <ipso-facto> it's unspecified!
[21:12:47] <wasamasa> it's a funny way of saying that, yes
[21:12:57] <ipso-facto> even the document has it as an example
[21:13:14] <ipso-facto> (set! x 4) =⇒ unspecified
[21:13:39] <mario-goulart> That's probably about the fact that set! returns an specified value.
[21:13:43] <ipso-facto> no wait. i take it back again.
[21:13:53] <mario-goulart> /specified/unspecified/
[21:13:53] <ipso-facto> mario-goulart: right :)
[21:14:17] <mario-goulart> Well, it's specified to be unspecified. :-)
[21:14:26] <ipso-facto> mario-goulart: yes.  yes.
[21:14:32] <ipso-facto> but it shouldn't set it as per the spec.
[21:14:41] <ipso-facto> ok; not the end of the world.
[21:17:14] <ipso-facto> does anyone know the rationale? is it to keep users from using set! (?)
[21:17:14] <Zipheir> mario-goulart: OK, thanks.
[21:17:38] <Zipheir> ipso-facto: The rationale for not letting set! create bindings?
[21:17:59] <Zipheir> It seems obviously dangerous and inconsistent to me.
[21:18:00] <ipso-facto> Zipheir: for allowing set! to bind
[21:18:17] <Zipheir> Yeah, no idea.
[21:18:26] <Zipheir> REPL convenience, I guess.
[21:18:34] <ipso-facto> Zipheir: right.
