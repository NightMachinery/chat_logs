[18:39:51] <jnbrains> hello and happy new year
[18:40:28] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> hi jnbrains.
[18:40:43] <jnbrains> i've just installed spacevim, and i'm trying to set it up as rust ide
[18:40:56] <jnbrains> but it seems i'm failing miserably
[18:41:21] <jnbrains> especilially trying to set language server
[18:42:45] <jnbrains> i have set lsp layer, with filetypes = [ "rust" ]
[18:43:04] <jnbrains> and layers.override_cmd rust to rls
[18:43:57] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> neovim or vimï¼Ÿ
[18:43:59] <jnbrains> i have also installed the rls rustup component add rls rust-analysis rust-src rustfmt
[18:44:07] <jnbrains> neovim
[18:44:58] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> you should use enabled_clients instead.
[18:46:00] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> https://spacevim.org/layers/language-server-protocol/
[18:46:01] <jnbrains> i saw enabled_clients but wasn't sure what to set there
[18:47:15] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> ['rls']
[18:51:59] <jnbrains> ok, i did that... nothing changed

[18:54:53] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> can you see my message?
[18:55:19] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I am using gitter now. https://gitter.im/SpaceVim/SpaceVim
[18:58:54] <jnbrains> you want to switch comms to gitter?
[19:02:27] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> no
[19:03:14] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I have test `enabled_clients = ['rls']`, and it works well for me.
[19:04:58] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> or `enabled_clients = ['rust_analyzer']`
[19:06:32] <jnbrains> i've tried with both rls and rust_analyzer
[19:06:49] <jnbrains> maybe i'm approaching this wrong
[19:07:20] <jnbrains> i'm trying to get the async syntax check 'effect'
[19:07:53] <jnbrains> seen on https://sharksforarms.dev/posts/neovim-rust/ // Diagnostics
[19:08:33] <jnbrains> for example, where it notifies or error/warnings (red)
[19:24:42] <jnbrains> that 'linting' comes from lsp or i did assume wrong
[19:26:01] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> the checkers layer also provides lint feature.
[19:27:54] <jnbrains> from what i read in the docs checkers is enabled be default using cargo via neomake
[19:28:20] <jnbrains> i'm not sure i have neomake (if that's not something included in the neovim package)
[19:42:46] <jnbrains> ic... neovim is in the bundle
[19:43:07] <jnbrains> the issue seems to be the default linter is cargo
[19:43:18] <jnbrains> and i've simple testing with a demo.rs
[19:43:35] <jnbrains> when i create a project (cargo init ...)
[19:43:42] <jnbrains> and edit inside
[19:43:48] <jnbrains> the linter works
[20:00:59] <jnbrains> ok it seems i need to spend some more time digging the docs and src
[20:01:04] <jnbrains> thanks for the help
