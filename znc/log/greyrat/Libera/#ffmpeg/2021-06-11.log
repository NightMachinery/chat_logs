[04:25:16] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, when using ffmpeg with -v error to find errors in a movie, is there any way to get offsets for problems in play time instead of byte address?

[04:36:46] <DeHackEd> I don't think that's supported in ffmpeg. maybe if you used ffprobe to print stats for each frame, looking for the error mixed in with the output. but that's gonna get messy
[04:37:25] <DeHackEd> it still might not be exact, but should be to within 1 second

[14:55:42] <bencc1> What's the difference between AVCodecContext and AVCodec?
[14:56:23] <bencc1> and AVFormatContext vs AVInputFormat and AVOutputFormat
[15:00:25] <JEEB> AVCodec is a single decoder or encoder
[15:00:35] <JEEB> AVCodecContext is an instance of that decoder or encoder
[15:01:01] <JEEB> AVInput/OutputFormat is a single (de)muxer, and AVFormatContext is an instance
[15:02:29] <bencc1> thanks. I'll read the remuxing tutorial again
[15:03:47] *** Joins: TanoMarcelo (~TanoMarce@179.63.242.126)
[15:03:49] <JEEB> so for example when you get a decoder or encoder AVCodec either by name or codec id, the API responds "yes, I found a decoder/encoder with that" and you get an AVCodec back if it is found
[15:04:00] <JEEB> then if you want to utilize that AVCodec, you create an instance (AVCodecContext) of it
[15:05:02] <JEEB> so the AVCodec is just a definition of a decoder or encoder, and then you start an instance of such with the context
[15:06:28] <bencc1> got it
[15:06:53] <bencc1> and AVInputFormat is just the definition of the demuxer?
[15:08:43] <JEEB> yes
[15:09:56] <bencc1> thanks
[15:09:59] <elenril> more accurately, AVInputFormat is a demuxer for some container format, while AVFormatContext is a specific demuxing process of a specific file/stream
[15:10:52] <elenril> so you want to demux 3 matroska files - you have 3 different AVFormatContexts
[15:10:59] <elenril> but still just one AVInputFormat

[21:04:08] <apteryx> Hello!  I'm trying to understand why on some platforms (Debian-based, such as Debian and Ubuntu), my static build of ffmpeg cannot be linked into a shared library.  AFAICT -fPIC is used throughout the ffmpeg build, yet when it tries linking my so with libswcale.a, it says https://paste.debian.net/1200888/
[21:04:25] <apteryx> Curiously, the same builds passes on Fedora.
[21:05:07] *** Joins: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251)
[21:06:03] <apteryx> here's the tail of the build log, with the GCC commands, in case it helps: https://paste.debian.net/1200889/
[21:06:54] <apteryx> That's using the GCC 9.3.0 in Ubuntu 20.04.
[21:07:41] *** Joins: elenril (~elenril@tutturu.red.khirnov.net)
[21:07:48] <apteryx> by the way, is such question more suitable to #ffmpeg-devel?

[21:09:06] <DeHackEd> so you're trying to make a .so file by linking against .a files. I feel like that might not even be possible. but ffmpeg itself is proably not built with -fPIC then if it's coming out as a static link
[21:09:46] *** Quits: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:11:12] <apteryx> it's definitely possible as it builds OK on fedora/opensuse
[21:11:47] <apteryx> GCC is able to incorporate static .a into a .so, so long as they are built with -fPIC, in my experience.
[21:12:05] <JEEB> yes
[21:12:26] <JEEB> --enable-pic in FFmpeg's configure should make that possible, but then also of course everything static that FFmpeg itself links against should also be PIC
[21:12:44] <JEEB> also if you have any left-overs in any of your sysroots of old compilations, make sure they are not
[21:13:04] <apteryx> the build env is clean as that's running in a fresh docker container
[21:13:28] <JEEB> also you can debug the builds with make V=1

[21:41:54] <JEEB> probably, unless that is just caused by something else. I would as I said check the exact commands utilized to link both FFmpeg and your thing

[23:23:57] <JEEB> you receive it from the lavf context, it is in that lavf context's AVStream's time base
[23:24:21] <JEEB> decoders have a time base, so when dealing with them you have to rescale
[23:24:43] <JEEB> and if you remux, you will have to scale it to the output lavf context's AVStream's time base
[23:25:02] <JEEB> (and the input and output components of libavfilter filter chains have time bases as well)

[23:25:50] <DeHackEd> that would simplify a lot and have saved me some surprises. :)
[23:25:52] <JEEB> and take into note its time base
[23:25:59] <bencc1> I'm doing this so I think I rescale:
[23:26:00] <bencc1> pkt.pts = av_rescale_q_rnd(pkt.pts, in_stream->time_base, out_stream->time_base, AV_ROUND_NEAR_INF|AV_ROUND_PASS_MINMAX);
[23:26:14] <JEEB> I think there's a rescale_ts thing
[23:26:16] <bencc1> how can I compare audio and video pkt pts?
[23:26:36] <JEEB> which rescales all the time components in an either avpacket or avframe
[23:26:44] <DeHackEd> directly... assuming the time_base and start times are identical...
[23:26:55] <JEEB> bencc1: well you have the time base for both, and their pts?
[23:27:05] <JEEB> so you know how to compare them
[23:27:36] <bencc1> I thought the time_base depends on the codec usually
[23:28:27] <DeHackEd> nope. time_base usually comes out of the input file/network source/whatever
[23:28:38] <JEEB> don't expect things to have the same time base, you know the time base from where the thing you're comparing came from
[23:28:44] <JEEB> you have the time base and the value
[23:28:49] <DeHackEd> the codec, especially encoders, often need to be informed of what the time_base is in order to do bitrate calculations
[23:29:06] <JEEB> you can compare them, if nothing else, by normalizing them to some time base and comparing :P
[23:29:22] <JEEB> don't actually change the time base of the actaul AVPAcket's or AVFrame's things
[23:29:30] <JEEB> but take the value and rescale&compare
[23:29:58] <bencc1> ok
[23:30:09] <bencc1> I'll find how to compare. thanks

[23:35:20] <Enverex> Hi all. So I'm splitting out the audio and video from a film, the problem is the audio and video durations don't match once I've split them which causes a problem for the software I'm trying to use them in. I've tried -shortest and -async 1, neither helped (even when combined). Is there some way I can, when extracting the audio and video
[23:35:20] <Enverex> separately, ensure the resulting files match in length? Ideally programmatically given that I need to set this up to run in the background on a bunch of things.
[23:40:28] <apteryx> hehe, I just did the experiment of manually building ffmpeg in Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 33, then building the Jami library (which is a shared library that links to the statically built ffmpeg).  Worked on fedora 33, failed on Ubuntu 20.04.
[23:41:07] <apteryx> Perhaps a GCC 10 vs GCC 9 issue.
[23:43:44] * apteryx retries on Ubuntu 21.04, which is at same GCC 10.3.

[23:58:23] <znf> Enverex, when you say "split", did you re-encode?
[23:59:29] <apteryx> Ah!  It worked on Ubuntu 21.04 as well.  So it indeed looks like something got changed for the better going from GCC 9 to GCC 10.
