[15:27:19] <bookworm> well, TL doesn't do it by default no
[15:27:52] <bookworm> it's easy to do though if someone wants... if you do not trust an admin of a box, don't use anything they give you, as simple as that
[15:30:36] <bookworm> a irc bouncer is by definition a man in the middle, with all that entails and IRC is notoriously unencrypted by design
[15:32:14] <mnx> just asking about official release, not modified one. if logging is not enabled than this comment is accurate: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4255#issuecomment-859302312 ? it is stored in memory and dropped after user closes chat?
[15:32:42] <mnx> and I know how bouncer works and irc, but wanted to clarify :-)

[15:36:03] <bookworm> why though?
[15:37:08] <bookworm> but sure, TL doesn't log if not configured to do so, but the question is rather random
[15:37:57] <bookworm> because if you selfhost you know that ot isn't an issue (heck you could set your root fs to be non permanent) and of ypu don't you have no guarantees whatsoever
[15:38:58] <bookworm> you do realize that even RAM doesn't save you yes? BPF is a thing, anyone with root can dump the memory too
[15:39:30] <mnx> there's an argument about one client based on TL that tries to convince everyone that with logs turned off history will be persistent, even after reboots or server migrations 
[15:39:35] <mnx> yes, I know tht
[15:43:45] <bookworm> and they can easily do so
[15:44:04] <bookworm> what makes you think they can't do that if the control the server they can
[15:44:12] <bookworm> they*
[15:44:33] <mnx> I have my own instances, and I know I can turn on logs and it will be persistent 
[15:44:53] <mnx> but behavior like this wouldn't be possible by default using TL releases https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuu-dfMnsQc ? 
[15:47:36] <bookworm> depends
[15:47:43] <bookworm> znc is a thing
[15:48:17] <bookworm> what's your issue exactly? If you selfhost, just look at the code
[15:49:09] <bookworm> chat history is a thing too in ircv3 land if the server supports it but TL can't handle that yet
[15:49:46] <bookworm> an upstream IRC server is also free to send you whatever messages they want to
[15:50:33] <mnx> there's no znc there, that I know for sure, my issue is that someone makes a service out of this, and abuse his control over it, sharing private logs from users and inviting everyone to use it. At the same time they have in privacy policy that they do not store any logs whatsoever, that's the origin of my question 
[15:50:50] <mnx> and yes, I use ergo as my ircd and it has history on channels 
[15:50:56] <mnx> that's very nice feature :)
[15:51:29] <mnx> but it's not about history itself, but straight up lying about not storing logs 
[15:51:37] <mnx> to I'm trying to clarify that

[15:54:57] <bookworm> THEY CONTROL THE SERVER, they control the world as soon as you use their services
[15:55:21] <bookworm> what do you not understand there?
[15:55:44] <mnx> heh 
[15:55:54] <bookworm> they can pinky swear that they are good citizen and do the exact opposite, welcome to the real world
[15:56:17] <bookworm> what do you need from this channel though?
[15:56:28] <bookworm> it's not something anyone here can influence
[15:56:43] <mnx> I just asked about how the logs works 
[15:56:45] <mnx> nothing more 
[15:56:47] <mnx> nothign less
[15:56:55] <mnx> but thanks for the answers 
[15:57:01] <bookworm> we don't know. For all we know they patched TL
[15:57:19] <mnx> ok, thanks 
[15:57:21] <bookworm> default TL does what the admin said in the config
[15:59:47] <mnx> yes, I know that, and thanks for your time ;)

[16:07:06] <mnx> there's nothing here to be confused about - I know what I wanted, maybe a little passive aggressive "welcome to the real world" style that's completely unnecessary, but it's fine as I got the clarification needed :)
[16:07:10] <mnx> and thanks again
