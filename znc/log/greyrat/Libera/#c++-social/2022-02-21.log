[12:27:50] <MaNI> I'd think being fired as a programmer is quite rare, layed off sure, but fired? probably have to really suck for that, or I guess some major ethical clash 
[12:32:41] <Carbonflux> i have never fired a programmer.
[12:32:44] <T`aZ> not sure the diff between layoff and fired
[12:32:59] <Carbonflux> you always just "arrange" something.
[12:36:07] <Carbonflux> being layed off does not effect your reputation and in the us you can get unemployment payments.
[12:37:02] <jotham> hey Carbonflux 
[12:37:14] <jotham> don't think i've ever been fired as a programmer
[12:37:17] <T`aZ> here it's always layoff then, unless you did something really bad/illegal
[12:37:20] <jotham> laid off cause money ran out, sure
[12:40:14] <T`aZ> can also clash with your boss, and it ends there
[12:41:41] <jotham> yeah i had a bad relationship for 4 years with a boss once
[12:41:43] <jotham> but i was team leader
[12:42:05] <jotham> she said as much that she hated me but was confident whatever we produced was reliable, which was more important
[12:42:11] <jotham> i mean i paraphrase but that was basically it
[12:42:13] <jotham> at a christmas party
[12:42:18] <jotham> i just sat there thinking, that's sad
[12:46:41] <T`aZ> happens a lot
[12:47:12] <T`aZ> i dont like most of people i interact with, yet i still need to intract with them
[12:47:33] <T`aZ> trying to avoid that as much as possible though tbh :p
[12:48:11] <jotham> i like most people, even people i strongly disagree with
[12:48:21] <jotham> but some stuff at work atm i am just like
[12:48:27] <jotham> i don't even know how to solve
[12:48:43] <jotham> cause it's all human problems
[12:48:46] <jotham> not software
[12:48:49] <jotham> software you can just beat into shape
[12:48:53] <jotham> humans are a lot more work
[12:51:59] <Renderwww> just beat humans into shape
[12:52:33] <T`aZ> reminds me the 'cluebat' from bofh
[12:54:57] <jotham> bofh has to be nz's most famous export
[12:55:13] <jotham> maybe that's why i'm a sysadmin now
[13:26:27] <Carbonflux> this is why everyone wants to replace programmers with AI...
[13:26:30] <Carbonflux> https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode
[13:28:52] <T`aZ> meh, too easy when the output is clearly expected and automaticall verified
[13:29:11] <T`aZ> clearly expressed*
[13:29:51] <T`aZ> this is like running a super optimizer, it will also generate code for you, based on known input/output values
[13:31:09] <jotham> the hard bit about programming wont be fixed by ai though
[13:31:23] <jotham> cause it's all the social interaction and lies humans have produced about technology
[13:31:46] <jotham> it'd take like 10-20 years of ML reorganizing all of our deceit and conceit and cost cutting
[13:36:44] <Carbonflux> ya
[13:39:23] <T`aZ> receiving notification of build failures in CI, commented 20hours ago. Who the fuck checks CI on a sunday at 6AM
[13:40:40] <jotham> i'm literally paid to check things like that
[13:40:50] <jotham> so you programmers can spend more time on your superyachts
[13:41:06] <jotham> (i have heaps of exception tracing things go straight to my work cellphone alerts)
[13:54:07] <T`aZ> this is sunday, you should not be working
[13:56:40] <jotham> it's almost tuesday
[13:56:48] <jotham> i just got beaten up by the monday
[13:57:00] <Carbonflux> kiwi's live in the future.
[13:57:02] <jotham> my circle of harm is ahead
[13:57:16] <jotham> tuesday is the worst day of the week
[13:57:19] <jotham> monday is usually fine
