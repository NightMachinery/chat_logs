[00:21:03] <maroon> in the notes at https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/3477/dl.pdf it mentions it being a problem for primes to have many bits in common - is that referring only to RSA where p&q being too close together makes it easier to factor N, or does it also apply to switching FFDHE between 2 safe primes that are similar?
[00:22:34] <maroon> i.e. the 1024-bit safe prime from RFC2409 that the weakdg.org paper warned against - if someone had solved that 1024-bit safe prime, would they have an advantage if someone switched to a safe prime that was several million numbers distant from it

[04:36:24] <TimMc> The broader picture is this: Alice currently has a public key and a canonical URL where her journal can be fetched from, and Bob is trying to fetch her journal. I want Alice's journal to have a signed statement saying "this is my current identity, as of $timestamp" -- the notion of "identity" here includes both cryptographic and network identity.
[04:36:31] <TimMc> (public key and URL)
[04:37:41] <TimMc> It seems to make sense to me to bind the key and URL together that way, although I agree that the key *could* just as well be outside the signed portion.
[04:38:46] <TimMc> But also there will be a rotation/revocation mechanism for identity changes -- a list of historical keys & URLs, with signatures saying "this is the old identity, and I attest (with a newer key) that it changed to this newer key or URL".
[04:41:25] <TimMc> Hmm. I'll make a paste showing a mockup.

[04:50:53] <ms7821> you're not really binding the key and URL together though
[04:51:00] <TimMc> YAML syntax here, sorry. :-) And don't look too carefully at the "historical" list -- I haven't put a ton of thought into that yet. The goal is to have a signature chain so that if Alice rotates her key, Bob's client can "upgrade" from the old known key to the new one.
[04:51:12] <ms7821> you're signing them together, but an attacker could just replace the pubkey bit and calculate a new signature
[04:51:54] <ms7821> now if you created a URL that included the signature or public key (think .onion domains) it'll be easier for them to remain in one piece
[04:52:13] <TimMc> Agreed. In the TOFU case, there's no extra benefit.
[04:54:29] <TimMc> In the non-TOFU case (subsequent fetches of the journal) Bob can require that the key matches. I guess the key is still "bound" even if it's not explicitly included, because it's used for the verification, but I can't shake the feeling that putting it inside the block is somehow better. :-/

[04:58:17] <TimMc> But... I'm also uncomfortable asking people to look inside the signed block before verification, because I don't want to promote bad habits...

[14:33:36] <Arsen> TimMc: why NaCl in this case?
[14:33:48] <Arsen> PGP doesn't seem inherently weaker when using Curve25519 and Ed25519
[14:34:09] <Arsen> keep in mind, this isn't for instant communication, this is for long-term storage of individually encrypted messages
[14:34:42] <Arsen> a journal, as I said
[14:37:46] <Arsen> I was considering not using pgp anyway, just because that's a bit more boring though
[14:38:22] <Arsen> it would fit what I want to do, I'd just need to split keys up properly

[19:32:15] <sonOfRa> On freenode there was an "altcoins" channel that used to be our dumping ground for anything to do with cryptocurrency, rather than cryptography
[19:32:21] <sonOfRa> Not sure if that channel exists on libera
[19:33:16] <sshine> #cryptocurrency?
[19:36:10] <Peng> freenode had both ##cryptocurrency and ##altcoins. I don't know if they were mostly the same community or hated each other or what. And I don't know how it translated over to Libera.
[19:37:26] <TimMc> ##altcoins is the most highly populated channel I can find with relevant keywords.
[19:38:18] <riv> its best we help these ppl find the right room, rather than try to lecture them and convert them? :P
