[13:26:59] <Guest36> hello gnu radio users and enthusiasts, I have a need for a simple workflow for gnu radio. I understand it a little bit, but not much. Is there an extremely simple way for gnu radio to (of course using the building blocks it comes with) do a bunch of stuff on a decimated radio signal, then store sample stream buffer data in a file? I want to create
[13:26:59] <Guest36> a special program that processes 16 bit IQ samples one 50ms block at a time, and I sure hope this would be a simple thing to do.
[13:27:35] <Guest36> Im reading through the wiki and it seems like there's a million things GNU radio can do
[13:30:56] <Guest36> stream to vector seems like it's what I'd want but its not clear how items and input samples would translate into a simple 50ms frame of IQ samples
[13:33:38] <Guest36> secondly I see a lot of useful plugins for work I am doing in the Impairment Modules, does anyone have something like wideband noise pulses, such as those from a spark generator as found on motorcycles or in  piezoelectric fired gas stoves?

[22:03:35] <funkylab[m]> again
[22:03:40] <funkylab[m]> this is not a technical problem
[22:03:47] <funkylab[m]> you can train your neural network against anything
[22:04:16] <funkylab[m]> sometimes you might even train it to be useful, but that will depend on how well your training data represents what you want it to know
[22:04:44] <funkylab[m]> thus, just generating "some" noise and then hope you train a good noise canceler sounds a bit questionable
[22:05:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Mhm, NNs aren't magic (But i also don't know too much about them), how are they supposed to figure out what's noise and what isn't if signal theory can't differentiate between the two?
[22:06:09] <Guest36> I won't simply be generating noise. My current block graph has me adding impedence model effects to source samples, then attenuating them and overlaying gaussian noise. The network design will be a multi-stage convolutional autoencoder with specific enhancements derived from denoising and video processing networks developed in papers over the last
[22:06:09] <Guest36> 5 years that bring realtime (50ms) processing into the realm of plausible capability
[22:06:12] <funkylab[m]> Yamakaja[m]: ah point is that they are function approximators, for functions you don't explicitly state
[22:06:26] <Guest36> The autoencoder will be validated against the original source samples.
[22:06:41] <funkylab[m]> Guest36: so you *know* what kind of noise you want to simulate?
[22:07:14] <Guest36> the word "know" has many meanings to engineers. I am aware of what they look like on a waterfall and what people often call them.
[22:08:37] <Guest36> I want to simulate noise as it practically impacts shortwave users of wideband software defined radios utilizing direct digital capture mechanisms, which is typically intermodular distortion, impulse noise, and fading
[22:12:16] <Guest36> of all of these, only the wideband noise remains unimplemented, it typically consists of wideband impulse noise lasting less than 0.06ms
[22:14:11] <Guest36> Present noise blanking mechanisms(state of the art) use lookahead algorithms to determine if an impulse is noise or part of the signal, but if the neural network can learn to model the impulse noise distribution on a per-instance basis, it can essentially cancel it out to around 80% accuracy, and combined with signal recovery steps and estimation,
[22:14:12] <Guest36> its possible for a autoencoder to completely eliminate it
[22:18:28] <Guest36> https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.8852&rep=rep1&type=pdf There is research that has modeled some sources of impulse noise, but whether or not this is equivalent I dont know
[22:19:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: From a signal theory point of view, what allows you to make that distinction between signal and noise? Are you sampling with an f_s >> B_signal, so you can locate the wideband pulse more easily and then eliminate it? And how does that work if its shape isn't constant?
[22:19:05] <Guest36> what I do know is that for the sample bandwidth intended, the noise will remain continuous in frequency with a little variation in amplitude and phase

[22:19:37] <Guest36> It's shape is constant in the sense that it represents a horizontal line on the waterfall that crosses over all of the frequencies being sampled during the impulse.
[22:20:04] <Yamakaja[m]> And in the time domain?
[22:20:59] <Guest36> In the time domain it represents a pulse with an unknown duration and frequency not exceeding 5 milliseconds and typically between 6 and 30 microseconds
[22:21:39] <Guest36> sorry, unknown frequency of incident waves, generally the duration is between those two figures
[22:22:59] <Guest36> randomly inserting them every 40-120ms would probably be effective, since we want the network to learn the characteristics of what noise is and not necessarily the frequency at which they happen
[22:25:38] <Guest36> The neural network will process treating samples as frames and using temporal and spacial modeling, such that I will impair the source samples and sample both the unimpaired source and impaired output in 150ms blocks, sampling not only final output but output after adding each form of impairment to a block, feeding the final impaired block to the
[22:25:39] <Guest36> head of the training model and using each of the progressively less impaired sample blocks I have taken to validate each state of the multi layered autoencoder
[22:27:13] <Guest36> where it shall, in practice, take a 150ms sample and then continually process and cycle it in 50ms blocks by forgetting the first 50ms and adding a new sample on at the front of the temporal domain, and after processing the data spacially and temporally, return the central 50ms block each time it resamples the 150ms buffer, allowing it to sustain
[22:27:13] <Guest36> processing in a manner contemporary with audio processing neural networks
[22:31:23] <Guest36> The use of RNN for many years was because Convolutional network design struggled to effectively process temporal data and because convolutional networks suffered from quite a few problems, but these problems have been overcome by deeper understanding of how they learn information, such that with skip connections, residual nets, leaky approximation
[22:31:24] <Guest36> functions, and a few other steps taken, they meet or exceed the performance of an RNN, and are entirely self-trained- the only input that is needed is a validation
[22:31:33] <funkylab[m]> well sounds like your noise model is relatively complicated, so I'm afraid there's no out-of-the-box-block to simulate it
[22:32:22] <Guest36> there's no way to easily simulate wideband impulse lasting a variable but known length of time and repeating this according to a random frequency of events?
[22:32:28] <Guest36> damn
[22:32:44] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: What is the mathematical description of your noise model?
[22:32:55] <funkylab[m]> "easy": honestly, your model sounds more complicated than just what the noise source does out of the box
[22:33:04] <funkylab[m]> but it's not "complicated complicated"
[22:33:20] <funkylab[m]> as in, an embedded Python block could definitely implement something like that
[22:33:44] <Guest36> I dont know what the mathematical description should incorporate. I have described the way the noise behaves to the best of my ability.
[22:33:47] <funkylab[m]> compared to setting up and training an autoencoder, that should be pretty OK to implement :)
[22:34:10] <funkylab[m]> Guest36: :) and thank you for that, I think that's sufficient for you to implement it in Python, right?
[22:34:23] <Guest36> It wouldnt be considered noise as in a random distribution of "noise"- it would be considered noise from a human perspective

[22:37:31] <Guest36> His background unfortunantly is not in signal processing, but rather in noise making.. AC grid circuits and the like
[22:38:26] <Jacob[m]123> EE/signal processing types use neural nets too :)
[22:38:42] <Guest36> sure, but they dont make them available for free to gnuradio/sdr#/cubicsdr users
[22:39:06] <Jacob[m]123> That is accurate
[22:39:23] <Guest36> This should be a pretty standard component though. I would imagine that there are applications where gnu radio is used to simulate or model a radio system and to measure the performance in a simulated environment, and the fact is that many such real world systems will likely encounter such impulse noise. They constrain the effect the noise has on
[22:39:24] <Guest36> their system and rely on brute force signal strength and error correction to overcome it, typically, so they do not need such work
[22:39:55] <Guest36> if they use neural networks right now at all, even the state of the art is largely in vision processing and classification, not noise reduction. if you have noise, just increase your gain and dynamic range
[22:40:03] <willcode4[m]> Impulse noise blankers probably focus on the perception of noise more than removing it.
[22:40:22] <Guest36> that is correct, and as a result, they are not particularly effective at sundown
[22:41:18] <Guest36> That is to say, lightening strikes and other occasional sporadic high energy impulse noise such as caused by a noisy transmitter keying up or a high amperage AC circuit are satisfactorily attenuated for the purposes of amateur radio uses by impulse noise blankers.
[22:42:09] <willcode4[m]> Impulse noise has destroyed your signal in an unknown way. There's no error correction for audio, except what's between your ears, so a noise blanker gets rid of the pop sound and you do the rest.
[22:42:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> At ionospheric collapse, the SNR of the distant signal goes to 0.   Not sure how neural nets are going to help with that.
[22:42:21] <Guest36> However, around sundown during inclement weather within about 140mi, or whenever someone leaves the igniter on their stove on nearby, all or nearly all of your decimated output will have that impulse
[22:42:49] <Guest36> A neural network can estimate fading using temporal reconstitution. it has been done for video, it can be done for audio.

[22:43:20] <Yamakaja[m]> But you can't extract information out of a signal who's information has been destroyed
[22:43:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Don't bother me with information theory.  I have papers to write :) :)
[22:43:53] <Guest36> The neural network knows what the signal should look like, it knows what has been done to corrupt it, it can recompensate after attenuating the noise impulse
[22:44:12] <Guest36> If it can do it for video, it can do it for RF.
[22:44:14] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: Well then why not just skip the entire channel and just return the original information?
[22:44:37] <willcode4[m]> Video noise reduction makes the picture "look" clean. But nobody actually cares if you are looking at the exact picture that was sent. Sure, you can make an algorithm to fake correctness.
[22:44:39] <Guest36> Is your solution in search of a problem?
[22:44:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> video has this property of having a LOT of redundancy between frames.
[22:45:05] <Guest36> CNNs are great at interpreting visual data and data that does not come in a sequence.
[22:45:42] <willcode4[m]> Because the convolution is defined in 2D.
[22:45:45] <Guest36> I don't plan to use an RNN, but a convolutional spacial-temporal autoencoder with skip connections.
[22:45:55] <Guest36> We now have such magical things.
[22:46:05] <Guest36> And yes, it can learn convolutions in 3d.
[22:47:34] <willcode4[m]> CELP codecs sort of do this.
[22:47:49] <Guest36> https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02147604/document I present DVDNET, a research paper from 2019, showing a state of the art convolutional network, which only uses two frames before and after the desired frame
[22:49:13] <Guest36> within a 150ms sample it should be possible to obtain enough temporal resolution to overcome impulses which are at most 6ms in length
[22:49:43] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: I'm sorry but you will never be able to reconstruct *arbitrary* data that has been destroyed. What you might however be able to do is stuff like detecting *when* the signal was impaired by such noise bursts, and *if* you make assumptions about the contents of that signal, for example speech, you might be able to use language models or other tools to fill in the gaps, but at that point you're just making educated guesses
[22:49:48] <Guest36> not for purposes of DATA, but voice and music, again, shortwave listening
[22:50:32] <Yamakaja[m]> So if you're only worrying about Audio, why not just apply to normal audio techniques?

[22:51:24] <Guest36> You're arguing the motivations for my work which is defeatist in nature. I encourage you to applaud my action, comment that it will likely be difficult, and seek to support or otherwise constrain the debate to the context of the inquiry. I did not ask if I should do this or if this would work and I did not come with a problem in search of a
[22:51:25] <Guest36> solution(noise removal)- I came with a problem with search of a solution(noise generation). To distract from my inquiry is to make yourself the intermediator of my intelligence and potential, something I find very souring to friendships, my good friend.
[22:51:43] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: You say this is a solved problem for audio, so just extract that audio from your receiver and apply your networks to that - done :D
[22:52:13] <Guest36> I cannot simply do that because convolutional networks train by validation. This means that I must have a GOOD copy in order to teach it what shouldn't be there.
[22:53:25] <Guest36> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00273.pdf I present a medical image decoding convolutional autoencoder, developed in may 2021
[22:53:50] <Yamakaja[m]> Okay, first step: Develop a mathematical model of what your noise should look like. If in doubt, ask your brother. Then write a script to insert those impairments into a training dataset and there you go
[22:53:51] <willcode4[m]> You can teach it to recognize noise via attributes of the signal. The noise itself is random, so you can't know what is noise without already knowing what is signal.
[22:54:56] <Guest36> My brother works for a major electrical company that develops substations and AC power systems. They generally do not concern themselves with modeling RF noise, although there are some studies I have looked up today on impulse rf noise generated by substation systems which were researched by electrical companies. However, this is not the typical
[22:54:57] <Guest36> nature.

[22:55:27] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: Your brother has studied EE and has likely come across a basic lecture on signal theory - that should be enough to cover this topic
[22:56:30] <Guest36> Look, I can just develop it without impulse noise. I will wind up submitting it to gnuradio and other projects as a useful tool in their library for noise attenuation, it will be used by millions, but it won't be able to do impulse noise because I just couldnt model that.
[22:56:42] <Guest36> Sadly, we'll have to live without
[22:58:05] <Guest36> As for whether or not I can reconstitute what "isnt there" in the eyes of mammals using their current state of the art approaches, I present https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/738913/1484944/main_copia_x_AIR.pdf
[22:58:35] <Guest36> it may very well be there, we simply do not have the knowledge of how to derive the correlations required to reconstitute it
[22:58:43] <bpadalino> this is a bonkers conversation
[23:01:03] <Guest36> at the very minimum, if you have an impulse that swamps your original signal, the original signal is still there, but it is now present as a much smaller amount of the total energy in the impulse. it's like trying to pick out a wave on a lake, when there is a much bigger wave coming in, the bigger wave absorbs the energy of the smaller wave while
[23:01:04] <Guest36> it passes through. but in some hypothetical sense, that energy is still there, and might be visible to a trained eye as subtle variation in the larger wave, which doesn't mean you can restore it as it was- that would violate nyquist. however, if a trace is present, a neural network could try to recompensate it...
[23:02:06] <drmpeg> Back in the 80's,there was this technician that worked for PGE, the local gas and electricity company here in Silicon Valley. His job was to take care of interference complaints to TV reception. But the local hams found out about him and started using him to solve their interference issues. He helped so many hams (including me) that the Northern California DX club threw him a big party when...
[23:02:07] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest36: So you're basically saying "Getting that data isn't possible because it would violate a law of information theory, but NNs might be able to do it"?
[23:02:08] <drmpeg> ...he retired.
[23:03:00] <Guest36> The data, in a signal with a given bandwidth, cannot be restored. However, the analogue waveform, where the signal isn't digital, the energy is in a complex way transformed by the signal which is swamping it.
[23:03:54] <Guest36> the energy is present just as two waves are present even when the stronger wave overrides the weaker, and that is why you can use your radio at all, if it wasnt, then your radio wouldnt work- the energy of each wave at a different vector passes through the other waves, which is part of the whole constructive -destructive interference theory
[23:04:03] <Guest36> it's why phasing antennas works
[23:04:39] <Guest36> the question is if enough of this is present at the receiver that the NN could hallucinate the subtle variation that a human or a normal algorithm couldnt, given sufficient resolution, sensitivity, and dynamic range
[23:05:37] <Guest36> if it could do so to a small degree, it could synthesize the audible waveform from those clues, so you'd have, yes, a fictional representation of the original, which does not contain the multitude of the actual energy-information originally present

[23:27:15] <Guest36> For lathework and milling it is terribly exciting to me to learn about the tools and how we originally innovated precision machining. No contest there. But when you need to take a crash course in physics to learn to do something on a computer, it's a totally different level of complex. We take for granted how simple the tools we use are, and can
[23:27:16] <Guest36> easily conceive of what seem like simple and novel uses for them. But the more novel(and therefore useful) they may be, the more potential there is that the existing toolbase is insufficient, and the more complex the underlying challenge that the tools we have solve, the deeper the iceberg runs. But it didn't seem so complex from the surface.
[23:27:26] <Guest36> Frankly, I wish all the laws of physics were as simple as watchmaking
