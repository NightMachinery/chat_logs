[01:54:48] <freeman_h> jochum, using wordpress when I edit my .htaccess file or delete the .htaccess it always get replace / recreated with the old configuration. Spend the last few hours with the wordpress guys and i have 2 options 1 make .htaccess only readable by www-data or try and clear the fastcgi cache because we have tried everything
[01:54:49] <xx> DLange: it definitely cares though, because PDF/A gives special requirements about newlines being present at all
[01:55:01] <xx> such as before every 'endstream' keyword
[01:55:22] <ayecee> freeman_h: do you think that something in the fastcgi cache creates the file?
[01:55:43] <xx> similarly a 'endobj' must be on its own line as well

[04:53:52] <yevaud> jochum: I don't know. I think that cloudflares tools, when used absolutely correctly can be used by reasonably low skill teams to provide very strong protection against denial of service. we've used it to great effect to prevent even application level denial of service. it is dangerous when not configured correctly because it makes people complacent.

[04:54:57] <ayecee> hi^-^: i don't know offhand how the traffic works. keep in mind that a service that uses cloudflare doesn't have to use it for all traffic.
[04:55:23] <yevaud> this is not illegal, they are violating copyright, and it means that we can protect customers extremely rapidly.
[04:55:24] <rascul> cloudflare is a mitm for https traffic
[04:55:24] <ayecee> Dagmar: counter-opsec then.

[12:03:06] <jim> Metalsutton, your questions are not off-topic here; so you're ok asking
[12:03:44] <Metalsutton> linux is hailed as it just working when it comes to drivers, but i have recently had the opposite experience. I am looking for advice on if i should keep chipping away at it, or is there sometimes just points of no return that packages might not play nice with each other, and so the only thing to do is to do a fresh install. Basically I am asking: How hard is it to break linux.

[12:12:15] <ayecee> in what way
[12:12:30] <dTal> try alpine or void linux
[12:12:38] <ayecee> no, don't do that
[12:12:44] <Metalsutton> and was asking if i thought about arch linux (which i assume is based on something else) as it might have better compatability . I am not sure if different distros have those huge differences.
[12:12:51] <ayecee> it won't
[12:12:57] <jeffreybenzos[m]> dTal: already on alpine
[12:13:02] <DPA> In any case, verify the screen works before trying to use it.

[12:13:37] <TJ-> Metalsutton: rasbian a.k.a. RaspbeeryPiOS is built specifically, and if the touchscreen is designed for the Pi, should be enabled via adding device-tree (DTB) entries in the config.txt

[12:14:04] <Metalsutton> One of my test scripts can draw to it. I found it in a forum. It definally works. But using '/dev/fb1' in a pygame script does not give the same results. It outputs to fb0 no matter what
[12:14:24] <ayecee> jeffreybenzos[m]: it's a known type if you have the ntfs-3g tools installed
[12:14:48] <TJ-> Metalsutton: so the driver's work but the applications aren't addressing the correct framebuffer device? That is a very different issue
[12:14:58] <Metalsutton> ok before i type any futher, ill detail out my issues and scenario and post it somewhere first
[12:15:07] <jeffreybenzos[m]> aight it looks like alpine has ntfs-3g-progs AND ntfs-3g as packages
[12:15:12] <TJ-> Metalsutton: raspberrypi forums would be best
[12:15:23] <ayecee> ntfs-3g-progs sounds like the right one. i don't know what the other one would be
[12:15:39] <TJ-> Metalsutton: you know there's a #raspberrypi channel here, too?
[12:15:44] <Metalsutton> I do.
[12:16:18] <Metalsutton> I came here to ask about linux tho. Since I am really using this as a confidence test to how to deal with linux installs.
[12:16:30] <Metalsutton> ayecee got where i was coming from.

[12:17:17] <jeffreybenzos[m]> it's that i had progs installed, but not the original
[12:17:25] <jeffreybenzos[m]> progs is the utilities, ntfs-3g bare is just the driver
[12:17:36] <jeffreybenzos[m]> see, i was under the impression that i could just have the whole kernel for free
[12:17:37] <jeffreybenzos[m]> none of this module life
[12:17:44] <jeffreybenzos[m]> are there any distros that just shove the whole possible kernel in there?
[12:17:51] <jeffreybenzos[m]> or is that literally impossible anyway
[12:18:02] <TJ-> Metalsutton: my point is that it is likely someone else has gone through what you have whilst using a RasPi and therefore that channel is more likely to have someone who can help

[12:19:27] <DPA> Ok, so the screen works. Now, usually /dev/fb1 is just emulated for backwards compat, while the real device is in /dev/dri/card*. I'm no sure if the KMS backend is enabled in raspians SDL, if it is instead of the framebuffer backend, that could explain why changing the FB device for the fb sdl backend has no effect.
[12:19:43] <ayecee> jeffreybenzos[m]: ntfs-3g isn't really part of the kernel. it uses FUSE interface (filesystem in userspace).

The setup needs to be fault tolerant, ( I don't wanna lose all my knowledge because I lost the usb drive ), I want to search
[18:35:35] <usr123> through it at grep speeds, and it'll really help if it's online. My current solution is just a $5 machine on digital ocean.

[22:00:27] <ayecee> yeah, that was pretty slick
[22:00:40] <TJ-> TomyWork: I hadn't spotted LINBOT had 76 repos until you mentioned it - I had seen the drbd and drbd-8.4 repos but nothing else
[22:00:43] <TomyWork> yeah, how i replaced that 4 by a 3, that was pretty smart
[22:01:09] <TJ-> right - got the debian code so going to dig in... I may be gone some time!
[22:01:26] <ayecee> TJ-: sure would be nice to see the live data and the stack trace for this. kgdb and a vm could make that a reality.
[22:01:56] <ayecee> haven't tried it myself though, so i won't handwave it as something easy :)
[22:02:09] <TJ-> oh lovely.. code has been massively refactored!
[22:02:15] <ayecee> sure seems that way
[22:02:41] <TJ-> ayecee: kgdb is a nightmare unless you can get all the ducks in the pond in a row!
[22:02:49] <ayecee> TomyWork: sure but also the fast work in drilling down to the specific commit.
[22:02:52] <TJ-> ayecee: I find it usually easily to reason about the source-code
[22:03:51] <TJ-> code is in user/v84/drbdadm_main.c
[22:03:56] <ayecee> TJ-: i usually find that easy too but I find it harder within the kernel where it's not always obvious what's behind the struct.
[22:04:59] <ayecee> have to step back to see where the struct was populated, and then step back again to see where the stuff that populated it was populated. bit of a maze.

[22:05:28] <TJ-> what's the betting the fault is in the reg-exp IPV6ADDR  in  user/v84/drbdadm_scanner.fl
[22:06:13] <ayecee> my bet is that it's not a fault at all but an assumption about the implementation that isn't borne out in the code.
[22:06:39] <TJ-> I think I see the problem... it can't cope with ::
[22:06:50] <TomyWork> ayecee, i just got a log between 8.3.8 and 8.3.9rc1 and then just ctrlfed for ipv6
[22:07:03] <TJ-> ((({HEX4}":"){0,5}{HEX4})?":"{HEX4}?":"({HEX4}(":"{HEX4}){0,5})?("%"{STRING})?)|("::"[fF]{4}":"{IPV4ADDR})
[22:07:43] <TomyWork> excuse me, why is this a regex?
[22:07:57] <TJ-> if you look at the first alternate (before the |) that ends with an optional "%"{STRING} ... the captures leading up to that don't allow for :: as far as I can see
[22:08:03] <ayecee> TJ-: easy test, i guess. format the address, fully expanded, and see if it works?
[22:08:07] <Raito_Bezarius> koollman_: my question was not on how to do it, I am aware of IPPROTO_ICMP but rather what is the rationale for not providing alternative :P

And so far I have been able to sync `gdrive` with `rclone` the issue is the integration . The guy in the tutorial is using `External Storage - nextcloudapp` and once on there is setting up the directories as `local` external storage . I have been
[22:13:57] <fakuve> able to sync them and Its a bit faulty the issue . I can popin in my `html GUI nextcloud` to the External Storage folder , but I cannot create anything from there . and If I do create something from the server console directly wont get refreshed the `nextcloud-gui` I think I should use SMB  ? how did you manage?

[23:44:31] <ayecee> all of those are ports that mail servers use
[23:44:43] <ayecee> they may not all be used for your mail server
[23:44:45] <uwharrie> NakedKing: you don't need any of those ports depending on what the server is intended to do
[23:45:06] <Psi-Jack> NakedKing: Look at /etc/services for what those ports are.

[23:45:38] <uwharrie> adding ports blindly like that is a bad idea

[23:47:48] <ayecee> setting up the firewall to pass stuff through before setting up the service is a bit backwards.
[23:47:54] <uwharrie> 1. get new system/IP 2. open ports 3. deploy bad config 4. become spam relay 5. goto 1

[23:52:21] <Psi-Jack> Once you setup a mail server, it's pretty resilient. If it's not, you didn't set it up.
[23:52:40] <ahungry> +1
[23:52:51] <Psi-Jack> You can even have a mail server down for a week, and still take your time to fix whatever's wrong because REAL mail servers, queue and re-try.
