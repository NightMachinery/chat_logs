[16:42:20] <tabakhase> more so not sensible yes - possible... i guess technically it kinda is...  there are proxys that can handle raw tcp, but you do not have the "host" header that allows the whole pick&chose... -- so you would need multiple ips (wich then all could use the default port to the outside) and do the routing-decision based on that -- or go a domain deeper, "logstash" and there like could not just 
[16:42:21] <tabakhase> forward, nut then also modify gelf-packets or such (to add a field thats then used for further rules in graylog&co) --- but this is quite the adventure at this point :D
[16:43:58] <tabakhase> that may make sense if as a "product" i want to publish 3-5 "fixed names that sound and look cool" - but for anything else its prob utterly useless when you can just stick to using the port :P

[19:23:27] <ph88> what if i don't need to change compose file and only need to change Dockerfile ?
[19:24:01] <[twisti]> sometimes you will need a `docker-compose down` first, and sometimes even a `docker-compose down -v` - they both delete various ephemeral data that may be corrupted
[19:24:06] <programmerq> then you'd change the Dockerfile, run 'docker-compose build' to force any builds, and then 'docker-compose up -d'
[19:24:17] <[twisti]> or `docker-compose up -d --build`
[19:24:56] <programmerq> 'docker-compose down' is really more for when you want to remove a project. it isn't part of my processes for the operation in question, which was how compose would handle updating one container only if only one needed an update.

[23:10:41] <hosk> why would it show a port?
[23:11:11] <DoofusCanadensis> didn't publish one?
[23:12:40] <hosk> if you're "docker run"ing you need -p host:container like -p 8080:8080 and if you're docker-composing you need ports: \n -8080:8080
