[01:16:38] * Deneb just looking at deniska's link
[01:17:04] <Yhg1s> Deneb: usually you don't, and you just don't re-use the dict. For example, using 'plot = {}' instead of 'plot.clear()' to create a new dict. But if you insist, dicts do have a 'copy' method.

[01:19:10] <bjs> ham5urg: because the default arguments get evaluated right away, not when the function is called
[01:19:12] <deniska> ham5urg: the `def` line (and its defaults) is evaluated when a class body runs, when it runs, `self` is not a thing which exists

[01:19:24] <Yhg1s> Deneb: the usual way is to create a new dict for each record, rather than re-using the old one.

[01:24:58] <theprophet> then comes back again.
[01:25:13] <catern> aha! help calls dir on the class
[01:25:18] <catern> so I need a metaclass with a __dir__
[01:25:33] <catern> great, this is a simple and sane thing that I should definitely be doing
[01:25:55] <bjs> theprophet: when you say `for x in y` the y is read once at the start, so if you re-assign "y" it doesn't affect it
[01:26:33] <Deneb> Yhg1s: I vaguely see what you mean, but what's the difference between plot.clear() and plot = {}? Are you saying one clears the existing item and the other creates a new instance?
[01:26:47] <Deneb> that's kind of weird
[01:27:06] <Yhg1s> Deneb: '{}' makes a new dict. 'plot = {}' assigns the new dict to the 'plot' name.

[01:28:41] <bjs> theprophet: do you mean "i"?  you also have a variable called "numbers"
[01:28:50] <Xano> Yhg1s, So the pickle API will automatically call __getstate__/__reduce__/__copy__ on anything returned from __getstate__ that isn't directly pickleable?
[01:29:31] <Deneb> ...unless once it is assigned to something else a new one can exist in its place.. hmmm....
[01:29:39] <Yhg1s> Deneb: no, but names are independent of objects. The object isn't destroyed just because a different object is assigned to the name. bit.ly/pynames1, which deniska already referred you to, tries to explain this.

[09:48:33] <TML> AugustusCaesar24: in most cases, your Linux distro vendor will probably have a package named something like python3-dev or python3-devel that you can install which will fix that

[15:57:16] <nedbat> rendar: there is no "the" python repl.  which one are you talking about? in the terminal, or IDLE?
[15:57:30] <rendar> nope i mean this, https://bpa.st/AHBA -- the one with '>>>' prompt, you get when you call 'python' when you've just installed cpythohn
[15:57:39] <rendar> terminal
[15:58:22] <nedbat> rendar: ok, good.  i don't think python does anything special with tabs there. the terminal displays the tab as it wants.
[15:58:32] <rendar> i see
[15:58:58] <rendar> so in the repl you just press 1 space bar, instead of hitting tab button, now i got it sorry
[15:59:11] <rendar> i misinterpreted it, thinking you *set* something at 1 space
[15:59:23] <nedbat> yes, i use the space bar
[15:59:48] <nedbat> (though maybe I'll switch :)  )

[16:00:19] <nedbat> i use the tab key in editors, not sure why i don't in the terminal
[16:00:22] <rendar> so pressing a space, even if that's only the repl, dunno if i can do that, now that i have the habit of hitting tab
[16:00:44] <rendar> the thing is: 8 places for a tab is just unbearable

[16:01:53] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[16:02:07] <rendar> not so much, it depends, certain periods of time i do a lot of testing inside the repl

[18:05:56] <taeaad> Do I have to split out processes to make use of the other cores?

[18:06:58] <taeaad> I remember that there is a GIL, but I somehow thought there were more guns loaded by default.
[18:07:05] <bjs> taeaad: it depends on the exact work that is using up the time,  if it's deep calculations being done by numpy then a simple thread pool might be enough
[18:07:06] <grym> nope
[18:07:22] <bjs> taeaad: if there's a lot more pandas-y things going on then yes, a pool of processes is generally advisable
[18:07:43] <bjs> taeaad: see concurrent.futures.{ProcessPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor}  they will allow you to create a pool of threads and/or processes and then .map() some chunks of work over them
[18:08:03] <taeaad> I can specifically split out processes to run all models at the same time (the application is ML) since the models use the same basic data but are independent of each other.
[18:08:37] <taeaad> So instead of 'for model in models:' with the naive setup I supposed each can be a subprocess?

[19:29:22] <vanessa> when is it necessary to `super().__init__()` and when is it not?
[19:29:38] <Yhg1s> Pddy: re.search() returns None when the regexp doesn't match.
[19:30:05] <Yhg1s> vanessa: it's necessary when you define __init__() but still want the parent class's __init__ to be called. It's not necessary when you know you don't want to call the parent class's __init__.
[19:30:08] <NeilRG> vanessa: it's a good habit to always call super in __init__

[19:34:15] <grym> vanessa: this is python, what's this "static" thingie?
[19:34:27] <Yhg1s> vanessa: attributes in Python are either instance attributes, which are stored on the instance, or class attributes, which are stored on the class. non-static usually means 'instance attribute', but they aren't per-class. They are per-instance.
[19:34:32] <NeilRG> it's better to tell people to call super because the cases where you don't wnat to are extremely rare and usually indicate bad design
[19:34:37] <Yhg1s> NeilRG: I didn't recommend anything.
[19:35:00] <Yhg1s> NeilRG: equally, the cases where you want MI are extremely rare and usually indicate bad design.
[19:35:12] <NeilRG> Yhg1s: it won't be you that uses MI is the issue
[19:35:26] <NeilRG> some other class may choose to inherit from you, and if you're not calling super, they are broken
[19:35:36] <NeilRG> hence, just call super
[19:35:43] <Yhg1s> NeilRG: including classes that aren't yours in your MI hierarchy is an even bigger design mistake. And yet, I didn't recommend either thing.
[19:35:50] <vanessa> coming from Java, a static variable is a variable that is common to all objects of the same class, a non-static variable is specific to a given object.
[19:36:21] <grym> vanessa: that distinction doesn't really exist in python, but cf Yhg1s's "class attributes" vs "instance attributes".  Personally, i only use the latter
[19:36:23] <bjs> vanessa: there is no such thing as a non-static variable on a "class".
[19:36:28] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:36:33] <Yhg1s> vanessa: Yes, 'non-static variables' are instance attributes in Python. They're stored on the instance. They are not per class. They're accessed with 'instance.attribute' (or 'self.attribute')
[19:36:41] <bjs> vanessa: non-static attributes belong to instance ("self") not the class.
[19:36:48] <NeilRG> Yhg1s: I know you're not recommending MI.  What I'm saying is that MI is part of Python, and CMI is part of Python, and Python programmers should therefore respect the possiblity that they are used
[19:37:07] *** Joins: colindowell (~colindowe@ool-457a611d.dyn.optonline.net)
[19:37:08] <NeilRG> and part of that respect means you should call super in __init__, __enter__, exit, init_subclass, etc.

[19:37:42] <sco1> Pddy: do you have an example that matches with the code you provided? Your code snippet is looking at file paths and the RE101 link is HTML?
[19:37:47] <Yhg1s> NeilRG: and people who subclass classes shuld therefor respect that the class doesn't call super().__init__() :)

[19:38:07] <Pddy> sco1: sorry, but lets not clutter their conversation :)
[19:38:09] <Yhg1s> NeilRG: it's not really a matter of opinion. It's a thing you can do, *by design*, in Python.
[19:38:14] <vanessa> if the parent class is not instantiated yet, the instance variable doesn't exist. so if the child class has been instantiated and that child wants to access the instance variable of the parent class, how can it access something that doesn't exist?
[19:38:16] <NeilRG> I mean you can do whatever you like in your own code, but don't pretend it's good design

[19:38:27] <sco1> ^
[19:38:29] <Pddy> ah, okay

[19:39:04] <Pddy> sco1: no html, you want me to paste a whole block here?
[19:39:06] <bjs> vanessa: as you go up calling methods on different classes, they all have a "self" argument but this self object is the same for all of them. The instance attributes exist on self not the class.

[19:45:23] <Togra> so far anytime I've inherited a class, I've called its init too but I can see there being specific situations where you want to do something weird
[19:45:30] <Yhg1s> MacGyver: when you're in control of the entire hierarchy (as you should always be, when using inheritance) and you want to override behaviour in a parent. Or, when you're dealing with classes that work through inheritance, so you're forced to inherit, and you want to stop them doing something they're doing.

[19:45:56] <bjs> vanessa: In my paste, there is `c` which is *the* instance (my code only makes 1 instance, and it's of Child).  foo and bar both take a "self" argument,  you'll see that self was just c

[19:46:37] <Yhg1s> Pddy: you need to open the files, read the data, and search through the data. What are you reading to learn Python?

[20:04:40] <MacGyver> And multiple *interface* inheritance is quite common.
[20:04:56] <vanessa> O'Reilly people are funny. they assigned a lizard cover to a language that has a animal right in the name.

[20:35:59] <rendar> push safety?
[20:36:14] <cdown> as in you add some new field, remove some old field, change the type of some field, etc.
[20:36:33] <cdown> with json there's no protection against creating an object that can crash either the server or the client.
[20:36:54] <rendar> you do that protection by checking the JSON and the types

[20:38:04] <cdown> my answers don't represent my employer, yada yada.
[20:38:18] <cdown> but it's pretty clear looking at the last 10 years of site reliability that you really don't want to manually validate fields during IPC.
[20:38:21] <axisys_> how do I count the rows starting with 1 instead of 0 for pandas df ?
[20:38:24] <rendar> but fb is something very big, i've to do very little and basic commands
[20:38:24] <cdown> let thrift, grpc, or something else do it.
[20:38:31] <cdown> sure. you know your own risk tolerances.
[20:38:38] <rendar> thrift, grpc and so on, are binary protocols
[20:38:46] *** Quits: razzd777 (~razzd777@user/razzd777) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:38:48] <cdown> thrift doesn't have to be a binary protocol.
[20:39:43] <cdown> but sure, it may be more complex. i suggest that if you care at all about reliability, it's worth it though.
[20:39:59] <cdown> if it's just some hacked up project that will never see production use, go for it.
[20:40:00] <rendar> yeah i see your point
[20:40:12] <rendar> i guess so
[20:40:24] <rendar> i have also partial JSON streamer
[20:40:34] *** Quits: martums (~martums@user/martums) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:40:44] <cdown> yeah, this is another thing: you're eventually gonna end up badly reimplementing the whole of thrift/grpc with json :-)
[20:41:07] <cdown> (if it isn't just a one-off project that will never be iterated on or go into prod.)
[20:41:19] <cdown> that's also what i've seen a lot of over the years, people reimplementing thrift with json and deeply regretting it later.
[20:41:26] <rendar> ijson library does all that
[20:41:47] <rendar> isn't thrift invented at fb?
[20:41:49] * cdown goes to look at ijson

[20:44:29] <cdown> for prod ipc, i actually can't think of anything that's safe other than thrift or grpc.
[20:44:59] <mbuf> How can I bin the dataframe entries based on time intervals? df['TimeCategory'] = pd.cut(df['Time'], bins=["06:00:00", "12:00:00", "18:00:00", "24:00:00"]) treats the bins as strings.

[22:42:52] <Deneb> how does one initialise a dictionary with some keys? Let me explain: I am reading a config file using configparser. I would like to store the keys in the dict by [section][key] = value. I am starting by setting some defaults: cfg = {} cfg['Serial']['port']  = '/dev/ttyUSB0' but it complains with Keyerror: 'Serial'. If I try to initialise with keys {Serial: None} then it complains that NoneType is not assignable.
[22:43:07] <kittonian> ChrisWarrick, I just need a json string that shows me the id then the value, the id then the value and so on
[22:43:22] <kittonian> and that's what I cannot figure out
