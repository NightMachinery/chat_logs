[13:58:25] <belcher_> also the max difficulty drop is limited to a factor of 4 which increases the cost of the attack further

[19:41:57] <BUSY> belcher_, can you expand on that first point?  how does this time period drive the attacker's actions vs a different time selection?
[19:42:43] <BUSY> can't they eclipse you for however long they need
[19:47:37] <nanotube> BUSY: see this thread for more discussion: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9305/why-not-retarget-on-every-block
[19:52:55] <BUSY> i don't see anything about that attack in particular?  'if an attacker manages to isolate your node from the rest of the network'

[19:54:02] <BUSY> why are they required to mine through the completion of a full difficulty period to attack you?
[19:58:46] <BUSY> personally i think 10m and 2w are both good selections for a law of large numbers and network propagation, but i just didn't understand the attack detail
[20:00:36] *** Quits: HeySteve2 (~Hay@user/heysteve) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:02:23] <nanotube> even if you are isolated from the rest of the network, and the difficulty is X, they attacker has to finish mining at difficulty X until the 2016-block period is over. your node, even if isolated, will not accept lower-difficulty blocks until diff adjustment. so the attacker will have to expend significant compute power.
[20:02:57] <BUSY> is the general idea for the attacker to feed you false difficulty so they can continue the attack more cheaply?
[20:03:19] <nanotube> the whole situation is somewhat of an edge case, but if you imagine that the diff adjust after every block, then after you are isolated attacker just has to produce one more block, and diff will be adjusted downwards significantly because that one block took a while
[20:04:13] <nanotube> yes, the idea is to feed you false info, e.g... they send you a block which has a transaction to you as confirmed, you send them goods or whatever, but in the meantime, out on the "real chain" the transaction doesn't exist
[20:04:43] <BUSY> i get that part of it but i didn't see where difficulty fit in
[20:04:46] <nanotube> so if diff adjusts quickly, it's easier for attacker to feed you a string of blocks that 'confirms' the transaction that doesn't actually exist on the real chain
[20:05:45] <nanotube> if you are waiting for say, the standard 6 confs, it's harder for attacker to make those blocks if diff doesn't adjust after every block
[20:08:58] <BUSY> and once they have you in a fresh, hostile difficulty epoch, they can then continue to ease the difficulty regularly

[20:10:08] <nanotube> right
[20:11:18] <BUSY> i have to think through the details a few more times but i guess it makes sense
[20:11:20] <nanotube> but at any rate, chances are, as sipa says in that thread, chances are satoshi just chose some reasonable-looking constants. it happens that they turned out quite robust

[20:17:10] <caveman> belcher_: or the attacker maybe can just discover new blocks at add them?  why would he need to mine for ~2 weeks?  e.g. if my node is isolated, why shouldn't the attacker just give me new blocks?

[20:18:53] <BUSY> that's where i'm coming from also - don't they only need to isolate for as long as it takes to double-spend and defraud you, regardless of the difficulty period?

[23:22:10] <mxfm> Hi! I purchased some small amount of bitcoin at exchange half year ago, sent to my (full node on machine) bc address. Then I backed up the wallet file. Some time later I purchased more coins to the same bc address, later reinstalled the OS. But I have forgot about coping the wallet file after the second transaction. My understanding is that wallet file contains 'static' addresses, not transactions, so if I have the first backup of walle
[23:22:10] <mxfm> t.dat file I am fine. Or am I not?

[23:33:45] <nanotube> yes should be fine, as long as you backed up the correct file and still have your backup. just to double check, you can always restore backup and resync the node.

[23:38:18] <AndyS2_> mxfm: if it was the same address, the same private key (stored in the wallet) is used to spend the second output.
[23:39:04] <AndyS2_> newer versions of bitcoin core create those private keys based upon a secret made when the wallet is created AFAIK, so even if you chose a different address from the same wallet, it would be fine

[23:40:26] <AndyS2_> (much) older versions of bitcoin core didn't, they just pregenerated some 100(?) addresses and if you happened to use the 101th and didn't back up then, you probably lost coins

[23:41:09] <AndyS2_> reusing addresses is discouraged: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse
[23:43:16] <mxfm> Ok, thanks everybody for responding. I am currently rebuilding the blockchain, so will test whether I have access the relevant private keys.
[23:45:40] <mxfm> AndyS2_: I am running up-to-date version of bitcoin core, but I thought that my wallet.dat file is just a bunch of pregenerated static private keys. How 101 key could be added?
[23:46:14] <AndyS2_> mxfm: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet
[23:46:32] <AndyS2_> pre 2013 the keys were generated randomly when they ran out
[23:47:51] <AndyS2_> I'm not big on the details, but basically, if you received bitcoin in an address, then sent 100 transactions to other people, you ended up with your 101th address (change address), and that one might not have been in your first backup
[23:48:32] <AndyS2_> if you didn't backup again just then, but restored the wallet, all that change in the 101th address would be inaccessible by everybody, including you
[23:48:40] <AndyS2_> nowadays it's not a problem anymore, see link above
[23:49:09] <AndyS2_> I'm saying this because sometimes people make up half-accurate stories while actually dealing with something more complicated
[23:49:16] <mxfm> AndyS2_: I lanuched my bitcoin full node at January 2021. All my operations - purchasing two times bitcoin at coinexchange (sending them to the same address).
[23:49:53] <AndyS2_> mxfm: no need to dox yourself, I'm pretty sure you are fine in any case :)
[23:56:50] <mxfm> AndyS2_: I am not really worrying because I had low amount (I am not that kind of person who bought 10-20 BTC for $20 circa 2011 or so and now is desperate to hack his hard drive:)), I am just curious. I have read somewhere that bitcoin core client creates at first run some group of private keys which are reused when the client is running. I assumed that they are reused, nothing is added. It seems I was wrong on this assumptions. I also
[23:56:50] <mxfm>  have heard that there is another type of wallet - based on some seed (passphrase), which is definetely not my case - I was not asked any passphrase at all.
[23:59:41] <caveman> what causes bitcoin to have a maximum number of mineable coins?
