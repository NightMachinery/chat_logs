[08:02:38] <BWMerlin> I have forgotten nearly everything about inverse (or are they called wildcard?) subnet masks
[08:02:38] <BWMerlin> I am looking at an ACL 50 deny ip 10.16.0.0 0.7.255.255 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
[08:02:38] <BWMerlin> If I read that correct that blocks traffic from the 10.16.104.0/19 subnet to the 10.0.0.0 range correct?
[08:03:10] <signofzeta> Inverse subnets are inherently evil.  Is there an alternative syntax?
[08:03:23] <gibby> signofzeta: lolwhut?!
[08:03:37] <gibby> they're wildcard masks, ftw
[08:03:41] <gibby> s/ftw/ftr
[08:03:43] <layer8> gibby meant: "they're wildcard masks, ftr"
[08:04:52] <signofzeta> 0.7.255.255 is the opposite of 255.248.0.0, if that helps.
[08:04:58] <signofzeta> I had to look that one up.  I hate that syntax.
[08:05:28] <BWMerlin> I got that part (255 - 7 = 248)

[08:54:09] <signofzeta> before that, I used my homegrown PowerShell post-renewal scripts, but the native support was flawless.
[08:54:28] <signofzeta> the servers I abandoned after changing jobs are still auto-renewing their certs.

[08:55:33] <BWMerlin> Hey, I would of used the wildcard cert but the dickhead before me didn't record the private key
[08:55:36] <xe0n> LOL!
[08:55:38] <gibby> thats a failure on your sales staff
[08:55:39] <xe0n> thats even worse!
[08:55:44] <xe0n> use a wildcard across ALLLL services

[08:55:51] <xe0n> so so smat
[08:55:52] <gibby> they dont get certs if they dont pay
[08:55:57] <signofzeta> yeah, I know RD Gateway technically needs CAL's, but we never did that.  I just installed Certify and said "you do cert now"
[08:56:01] <gibby> let services fail

[09:00:53] <xe0n> its because free isnt always best, and i dont want certs auto rotating by themselves, especially if i've got the existing thumbprint attached to something
[09:00:57] <signofzeta> I also used DNS CAA records on my former customers' zones, to prevent mis-issuance.
[09:00:59] <xe0n> what the dominos break
[09:01:13] <signofzeta> if you're pinning my fingerprint, yeah, that's a good point.

[09:01:27] <gibby> its not a security issue, we call them out because they're widely used in illicit operations because they're free

[09:01:41] <technonerd> 24 hour certs
[09:01:45] <signofzeta> fair enough, gibby
[09:02:07] <gibby> so LE isn't a good cert auth for the most part because of that
[09:02:10] <xe0n> certificate assurance is a thing
[09:02:22] <gibby> like, 1-10 (10 being good) they'd be a 3

[09:02:36] <xe0n> RRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[09:02:42] <signofzeta> DNS CAA records would eliminate that, but as far as I know, only Cloudflare and GoDaddy support those.
[09:02:54] <signofzeta> but, like DNSSEC, that requires the DNS operator to do stuff.

Knowing cisco, or Windows (Client/Sever/O36)/IBM, etc) is the first step to knowing the org in which you'll end up working for. You can be a champion for FOSS or other projects but you have to understand enterprise before you can roll your own.

[09:08:40] <xe0n> well said
[09:08:45] <xe0n> +++
[09:09:06] <signofzeta> Absolutely.  Let's Encrypt was awful at first.  It worked great on Linux, but on Windows, the clients just weren't there.  Shit expired, needed intervention, and needed manual scripting.  A decent ACME client finally changed that.  Now, even my former manager puts LE into production.
[09:09:17] <xe0n> knowing the technology is one thing, psssh kids these days know enough, its understanding how to make decisions and understanding the power of processes
[09:09:19] <gibby> and, on top of that with MSP work: shit is expensive: lean on your sales people to sell, not you
[09:09:47] <signofzeta> My old manager hated his job, and the owner of the company didn't care.  I pretty much ran the show.

[09:11:38] <signofzeta> it's like implementing IPv6:  your Comcast modem and SonicWall router somehow hate each other and can't agree on DHCPv6-PD periodically.  It sours the rollout for everyone.  But do it in Azure and it's flawless.
[09:11:43] <a1> well don't mind if i do
[09:13:17] <gibby> Ipv6 isn't being implemented hard, focus on what is
[09:13:44] <xe0n> BUT WHY?!!?!!?!
[09:13:48] <xe0n> ITS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER
[09:13:50] <xe0n> FUCK NAT!!!!
[09:14:08] <signofzeta> it's important for service providers
[09:14:16] <gibby> You've brought up IPv6 like 30 times tonight. It'll happen but it's not now
[09:14:26] <signofzeta> though when I move clients to Azure AD and kill their on-prem stuff, they usually have an old router that I remove.
[09:14:47] <signofzeta> up here in the northeast, Comcast and Spectrum have it enabled for most customers, residental or business.
[09:15:05] <signofzeta> Verizon and Optimum, though, are just like "lol wut"
[09:15:06] <gibby> Service providers don't give a shit about IPv6 lol
[09:15:47] <xe0n> who fucking cares, as long as you can browse phub you're fine.
[09:15:54] <signofzeta> Comcast had to switch, because they filled up their management network, 10.0.0.0/8, with the sheer number of modems they managed.  I think they use DS-Lite or 4in6 instead of dual-stack.
[09:16:31] <xe0n> good for them!
[09:16:34] <JollyRoger> It's being rolled out here, as well, but not everyone has it yet. Most cellphone companies seem to be dragging their feet on it, which I thought was really surprising because you'd think that it would benefit cellphone companies, what with the huge numbers of devices they need to serve.
[09:16:38] <gibby> as a Comcast customer I still have IPv4
[09:16:41] <signofzeta> my home network with Spectrum?  "Router, meet modem."  "Hey router, you want a prefix?" "Sure."
[09:17:19] <signofzeta> Spectrum, I think, is native dual-stack.  IPv6 pings a few milliseconds faster than IPv4 sometimes, but that's about it.
[09:17:25] <signofzeta> it largely just works.
[09:17:32] <gibby> anywho, IPv6 is still a long way out overall. Internal to *some* large ISPs, sure
[09:17:42] <gibby> no one else gives a shit though 
[09:17:43] <signofzeta> and service providers
[09:17:43] <technonerd> i only have 6rd
[09:17:52] * technonerd cries
[09:18:11] <signofzeta> LinkedIn and Facebook run IPv6-only networks with NAT64 at the edge.
[09:18:24] <gibby> dude, I'm talking to 10+ proper carriers every week, no one cares about IPv6
[09:18:51] <signofzeta> at least not here.  I hear Carrier-Grade NAT is being deployed in the UK due to address exhaustion.
[09:19:09] <xe0n> facebook can suck a dick
[09:19:16] <signofzeta> all of my stuff is dual-stack, i've done my part.
[09:19:21] <gibby> we have a number of datacenters across the country and IPv6 is such a non-issue
[09:19:30] <signofzeta> and yes, Facebook can suck it all.
[09:20:17] <signofzeta> i had a few instances where my phone (T-Mobile, LTE) refused all IPv4 connections, because that's translated.  but that was a few minutes years ago.
[09:20:20] <gibby> focusing on the wrong angle
[09:20:44] <xe0n> sounds like you've got down the rabbit hole, signofzeta
[09:20:44] <xe0n> haha
[09:20:52] <gibby> (again) 
[09:21:11] <gibby> hey xe0n do you do IPv6?
[09:21:12] <signofzeta> i was an early adopter.  not 6BONE early, but Hurricane Electric tunneled around 2008.
[09:21:36] <gibby> congrats?
[09:21:39] <jesse> i feel like ipv6 is a half-assed effort from everyone
[09:21:42] <signofzeta> until Netflix classified it as a VPN.  Then Spectrum brought out 6rd, then they offered native support.
[09:21:54] <jesse> because there's no intrinsic motivation to do it
[09:22:01] <gibby> and there wont be
[09:22:09] <signofzeta> well, they only ratified the standard a few years ago, but we're edging closer to double-NAT for IPv4.
[09:22:17] <xe0n> nah no ipv6, no really fussed, how does that change my browsing experience?
[09:22:18] <signofzeta> don't forget, the IPv6-only porn experiment failed.
[09:22:19] <gibby> carriers are still IPv4 centric 
[09:22:25] <xe0n> how does that affect me peerrrrsssooonnaaallllyyyyyyy
[09:22:31] <xe0n> will my life change if i go to ipv6?!
[09:22:38] <signofzeta> it's like DNSSEC.  all zones should be signed, but they aren't.

[09:23:20] <signofzeta> there's no motivation to sign your DNS zones if your registrar wants money.
[09:23:24] <gibby> we're paying for a LOT of IPv4 addresses 
[09:23:24] <JollyRoger> Aaaargh.
[09:23:38] <JollyRoger> Good thing I didn't give up drinking.

[09:23:47] * JollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
[09:23:52] * jesse likes his ISP handing out static /56's for residential
[09:23:57] <signofzeta> it's like flossing:  you should use IPv6 and sign your DNS zones, but you don't have to.  sometimes a little pain isn't bad.

[09:24:56] <signofzeta> the next step for IPv4 is CGNAT, and that won't affect regular users.  but if some Xbox or PS_ needs a port opened and you're behind CGNAT IPv4, you'll start to hear complaints.
[09:25:22] <signofzeta> that's about it.  it's going to be a slow changeover -- and it's already been 20 years.  Windows XP included IPv6 as an option.
[09:25:23] <gibby> no shit?

[09:26:11] <gibby> ^
[09:26:13] <signofzeta> I'm not turning off IPv4 anytime soon, but I recognize it's time to begin moving.
[09:26:26] <jesse> why would i change? i have to maintain 2 IP stacks, v6 is not remotely comparable to v4, every CPE in existence has some shit flaw, this idiot blocked ICMPv6 again, ...
[09:26:26] <xe0n> why would you even attempt to do this shit on a friday
[09:26:33] <xe0n> i value my weekends
[09:26:34] <xe0n> lol
[09:27:04] <gibby> everything about IPv6 is less than Alpha 
[09:27:05] <signofzeta> most of my stuff is dual-stack, minus the LaserJet 4100 in my basement that refuses to die (and I refuse to spend $50 on a newer JetDirect card)
[09:27:16] <xe0n> hey those are tanks mate
[09:27:28] <xe0n> north korea will be printing on them in 20 years
[09:27:41] <jesse> pretty sure my LTE is single stack v6
[09:27:44] <signofzeta> oh yeah.  one of my friend's dad's paid to have his LaserJet IV rebuilt.  it's now well past 1.5 million pages.
[09:28:13] <signofzeta> LTE is single-stack IPv6.  IPv4 is considered optional for 4G/5G.  Most WISP's run an IPv4 translator.
[09:28:28] <signofzeta> iOS does NAT64, Android supports 464XLAT.  the result is the same.

[09:37:01] <sideup66> sorry
[09:37:04] <sideup66> internal ipv6
[09:37:17] <sideup66> and they cant even BUY blocks for 4, because IANA is out of space for them
[09:37:35] <sideup66> old isps (comcrap, verizon, etc) are old enough to have huge swaths already
[09:38:27] <sideup66> its actually a flipping problem because none of those providers can port forwardbecause of the CGNAT
[09:38:30] <sideup66> breaks all kinds of shit
[09:40:58] <signofzeta> i haven't seen CGNAT in use besides mobile networks -- thus far.
[09:41:17] <sideup66> starlink uses it
[09:41:29] <sideup66> tmo does too, though that network was mobile first
[09:41:35] <signofzeta> it's just weird that Verizon Wireless is IPv6-native but Verizon (wired) doesn't even offer it.
[09:41:45] <sideup66> i thought they did through tunneling
[09:41:47] <sideup66> do they really not?
[09:42:16] <signofzeta> my customers on FiOS don't even get an IPv6 RA response.
[09:42:32] <signofzeta> they're business customers, though.  maybe residential has it.
[09:42:36] <sideup66> signofzeta: that is bizzare for their fiber network though, though the design on everthing else is superior

[09:43:02] <signofzeta> you know what?  Comcast cable offers it natively.  Comcast's fiber is IPv4-only.

[09:45:03] <sideup66> its ancient infra they bought up 30 years ago
[09:45:05] <sideup66> and did nothing with
[09:45:17] <signofzeta> i hate comcast, but they provide some pretty decent service (New England region, USA)
[09:45:31] <sideup66> and simple stuff like a modem replacement is a complete fucking nightmare
[09:45:38] <sideup66> they well when they do
[09:45:43] <sideup66> but random stuff breaks them
[09:45:47] <sideup66> makes me think the infra is falling apart
[09:46:02] <sideup66> im in the PA region
[09:46:03] <signofzeta> I had one customer who needed a new modem at least three times a year.  They were too cheap to call me so just did it on their own.  I never figured out why.
[09:46:22] <sideup66> because they do this retarded thing where theyll blame the line, then send a tech out.
[09:46:29] <sideup66> if the tech finds a problem outside, he fixes it no charge
[09:46:33] <sideup66> if he has to enter your house
[09:46:35] <sideup66> you get charged
[09:46:38] <sideup66> and its a fight to change it
[09:46:45] <xe0n> sounds pretty standard
[09:46:53] <sideup66> i hooked up in my apartment (only provider)
[09:46:55] <signofzeta> cable sucks, but why do you think DSL is still around?
[09:47:04] <signofzeta> fiber to the home is still decades away at this rate.
[09:47:06] <sideup66> i had a problem initially with lines
[09:47:08] <sideup66> hadnt touched them
[09:47:10] <sideup66> brand new user
[09:47:14] <sideup66> oh were gonna charge you to fix that
[09:47:16] <sideup66> dafuq
[09:47:18] <sideup66> i rent the place.
[09:47:23] <sideup66> figured it out on my own but still
[09:47:38] <signofzeta> yeah, all of my problems back when I rented were thankfully outside problems.
[09:47:50] <signofzeta> "oh, we found a rusty splitter."  what, no one else complained but me?
[09:48:16] <MikeSpears> I know pretty much everywhere I had spectrum I never had issues

[09:48:40] <signofzeta> Charter and Spectrum have been good to me.  they even came to my house and ran a new line to the basement when I moved my modem downstairs.
[09:48:44] <MikeSpears> Lol fuck off
[09:49:01] <sideup66> xe0n: yeah but they have dreadful customer service, i hate dealing with them
[09:49:11] <xe0n> any telco\isp is shitty service lol!
[09:49:12] <signofzeta> well, I may have caused a signal issue on my own, maybe intentional.  but while the tech was there, I had him move it.
[09:49:20] <xe0n> which is why you try and avoid them as much as possible lol
[09:49:23] <MikeSpears> I've never had an issue the few times I had to call spectrum
[09:49:31] <MikeSpears> Or ATT for that matter
[09:49:45] <MikeSpears> Now frontier, fucking morons
[09:50:01] <signofzeta> but now my modem, router, and switch are in the basement, under the stairs.  my access point is upstairs.  my ethernet wiring looks like it was done by a child, but it gets the 1's and 0's across.
[09:50:21] <a1> and the occasional 2 probably
[09:50:25] <signofzeta> Frontier is awful, but my friend just got her DSL upgraded to 200 Mbps and she says it's fine -- aside from when she has to call customer service.
[09:50:49] <signofzeta> a1: "Ones and zeroes everywhere. And I thought I saw a two!" "It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."

[13:52:50] <CableNinja> yeah
[13:53:08] <Oliber> conversely, you don't really want each library to have it's own repo
[13:53:17] <CableNinja> thats part of what he was saying, is like, for example, debians shit is old af
[13:53:54] <CableNinja> I dont think that is 'so' terrible, as long as -every- version of a shared library is available
[13:54:21] <xe0n> CableNinja: im useful sometimes :P
[13:54:34] <CableNinja> whats so wrong with like having 10 sources.list.d/'s with your various apps, as long as the library versions required for your app, are also available
[13:55:13] <Oliber> yeah, and some of that is because they can't test everything fast enough, or the testing team is more interested in testing stuff in unstable than boring old stable
[13:55:36] <CableNinja> imo the problem is the incompatibility of it all, like, if you go 6 months without updating your repos and try to install a new package, most of the time you also need to do a dist level upgrade to be able to do so

[14:23:32] <sd> 06<A‚Äãda> sandboxing desktop apps is a great idea, but its not practical to literally just take sandboxing that works for a specific server usecase and force it into running on a desktop
[14:24:00] <CableNinja> right, especially when desktop apps need more access specifically for their gui things
[14:24:43] <CableNinja> containerization in general is not the answer, imo the answer is making more library versions available and unifying the kernels (which is pretty much 'impossible'); if the kernel api layer is the same, then the actual transport is easy
[14:25:22] <CableNinja> but that means having the same kernel api layer across 1000 distros, including windows, ibm, and good luck with all that
[14:26:52] <CableNinja> having to make different binaries for different archs is whatever, and 'mostly' easy enough, but the big issue is the big differences between for example rhel and debian, or even farther, bsd and mint
