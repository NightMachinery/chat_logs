[03:43:49] <shbot> The_Jag: bash: @@NAME@@: command not found
[03:44:01] <userdocs> maybe two separate commands with very specific sed matches

[13:16:39] <greybot> xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.
[13:16:46] <jetchisel> !ls
[13:16:46] <greybot> DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs

[13:18:00] <rendar> well, one possible solution would be `parallel -j5 rsync ... ::: /main/files/*`
[13:18:32] <rendar> i was wondering if i should use parallel or xargs, i'd use parallel, but what about it isn't installed? xargs is everywhere

[15:38:12] <pa_> i have followed an debugging tutorial.. and it give nice trace but it does this for the whole script... is their a way to only trace specific part in a script? the debug script to source with simple test https://paste.debian.net/1215633/

[15:38:54] <greybot> pa_: set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'
