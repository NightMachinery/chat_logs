[00:43:10] <GreenJello> it's a bit niche, though
[00:43:42] <shan> that's fair, i think
[00:44:10] <shan> if any of you decide to try it out i'd love to see what you guys make
[00:44:14] <GreenJello> there's a small window between using nothing and using react, and jquery mostly fills the in between area already
[00:44:35] <ljharb> what do you anticipate would be better with this than with react?
[00:45:00] <ljharb> i agree, it does look decent, but in a post-react world i'm not sure i see it
[00:45:03] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.213) (Quit: Haxxa flies away.)
[00:48:55] <shan> i mean the chief benefits are that you can migrate your existing vanilla js applications over to it slowly since it's not very opinionated on how you should build your software, and you can use it to sprinkle in reactivity to your sites. as for building new applications with it, it's a lot simpler to get started with than react, and you can actually use all of your vanilla js knowledge with it,
[00:48:56] <shan> there's no need to learn a new system of lifecycles and props and (J/TSX
[00:49:03] <shan> *{J/T}SX
[00:50:05] <ljharb> i mean, migrating to modules and transpiling is kind of necessary regardless, and if you assume someone's done that first, then using jsx isn't a big leap
[00:51:19] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.213)
[00:51:48] <shan> but using react and jsx is a huge structural change from using vanilla js, especially if your old codebase didn't maintain a clean separation between UI and logic, isn't it?
[00:52:39] <GreenJello> yeah
[00:53:35] <ljharb> that is true
[00:53:53] <shan> so that's sort of a nice-ish market to tap into. i like to think it's to React what Deno is to Node, but that's hugely arrogant of me since Deno is a much larger and feature-complete alternative to node
[00:54:17] <shan> unlike campfire which is three utilities and two classes
[00:54:19] <ljharb> deno's a joke, i wouldn't use that as a comparisopn
[00:54:32] <shan> :0 i actually quite like using deno
[00:54:36] <ljharb> deno's node's creator trying to become relevant again after leaving node made him irrelevant
[00:54:59] <ljharb> it drops most of the things that made node successful and adds some of the things that makes the browser horrible
[00:55:35] <shan> the deno ecosystem isn't quite there yet, but it's great to build software with, i despise the way node does things sometimes (npm et al)

[01:01:00] <shan> i asked a lot of people what they like in the frameworks they use, things that came up were small size, no-nonsense, unopinionated, easy to create and share components, great docs, easy to understand, reactive data is a must, using as much native stuff as possible, no DSL, "shouldn't feel like magic" and so i tried to address most of those things

[01:03:46] <GreenJello> shan, two main options: 1. {{x}} html escapes but {{{x}}} doesn't, or 2. have something like class Raw { constructor(inner) { this.inner = inner }, and .mustache('Hello, {{name}}', { name: new Raw('shan') }) to bypass escaping

[04:16:04] <ljharb> right
[04:16:07] <ljharb> so why does it have Buffer
[04:16:11] <ljharb> that's a node-specific thing
[04:17:31] <sheetjs> why does it try to replicate Buffer? possibly because its useful.  why does it have the concept in the first place? for transmitting binary data to/from C

[04:18:47] <sheetjs> "Why not just stick to typed arrays?" is a good question, but my impression from playing with the API is that there are two abstractions
[04:18:55] <sheetjs> the "JS" abstraction with the same semantics
[04:19:20] <sheetjs> and the lower-level representation

[04:22:29] <sheetjs> node or v8?
[04:23:55] <systemfault> You probably don't want to embed V8..
[04:24:19] <systemfault> I'd consider quickjs before it :p
[04:24:28] <sheetjs> duktape is a viable alternative to lua
[04:24:47] <systemfault> I had never heard of duktape
[04:25:12] <systemfault> It's its own thing? Or just some wrapper for another engine
[04:25:15] <sheetjs> duktape is really cool
[04:25:19] <sheetjs> its an engine
[04:25:35] <ljharb> sheetjs: node
[04:25:38] <GreenJello> I used quickjs for this: https://docs.rs/ctjs/0.0.2/ctjs/

[04:25:41] <ljharb> sheetjs: people use it on tiny boards all the time
[04:25:56] <ljharb> quickjs and duktape are both like niche alternative JS engines
[04:26:22] <sheetjs> "niche" is an unfair categorization of both projects
[04:26:42] <ljharb> maybe more unfair to duktape
[04:26:56] <ljharb> wasn't quickjs built just as a hobby project to see about making a faster engine?
[04:27:09] <ljharb> fabrice is brilliant but he doesn't seem to build stuff for practical purposes
[04:27:14] <systemfault> It was some hobby project from a programming god.
[04:27:17] <ljharb> right
[04:27:24] <ljharb> duktape at least is intended to be used in actual things
[04:30:05] <sheetjs> practical use cases are left up to the reader

[06:11:01] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: basically `ed`, but extended for web browsing functionality.
[06:11:32] <ljharb> like a text editor?
[06:11:45] <ljharb> so like, stallman using lynx while eating his toenails, web browsing?
[06:13:12] <Maxdamantus> So you can load a web page and read it as you would using `ed` (eg, using commands like `,5p` to print 5 lines), but it has extra commands for entering text into inputs, navigating through links, etc.
[06:13:50] <Maxdamantus> The main developers at least initially were blind people who preferred an `ed`-based interface to a regular web browser.
[06:13:51] *** Joins: brunodOut (~brunodOut@170.84.57.235)
[06:14:58] <Maxdamantus> since `ed` naturally already works as a one-dimensional stream of data, which is what accessibility software often tries to turn existing applications into.

[06:18:06] <ljharb> ok
[06:18:15] <Maxdamantus> I guess since it started in 2001, accessibility software was probably not a viable option.
[06:18:18] <ljharb> i'll be surprised if that's actually the easiest way for blind people to navigate the web
[06:18:22] <ljharb> but yeah historically i can certainly see it
[06:19:11] <Maxdamantus> I suspect it could be if you got used to it.
[06:19:22] <wez> heh, pun intended?
[06:19:23] <Maxdamantus> In the same way that vim can be the easiest way to edit a text file.
[06:20:20] <ljharb> wez: lol wasn't, but i'll take it
[06:20:31] <Maxdamantus> I certainly find it easier to modify text files using vim than using other tools, since I know how to navigate and perform repeated similar actions etc in vim.

[06:23:17] <ljharb> i've had a number of blind people present to my employers to show how they navigate the web, and it's decidedly not using a text editor
[06:23:30] <systemfault> It's not, they use addons like NVDA or similar...
[06:23:52] <systemfault>  And they use something like "narrator" but because they're so used to it... they speed it up 5 times
[06:23:55] <Maxdamantus> The feedback they get is text.
[06:24:01] <Maxdamantus> (narrated text)
[06:24:08] <ljharb> obviously they hear it as narration, right
[06:24:16] <ljharb> but that doesn't at all mean they're using a text editor to do it
[06:25:01] <Maxdamantus> When I say "text", I really mean all the words they hear, not necessarily the text that's on the page. They might hear things like "combo box 5 options selected option banana" where the only text on the page is "banana".

[06:31:30] <Maxdamantus> Analogous to how someone might use tab or some other single key to keep navigating through the elements of the page.

[07:56:13] <wroathe> Heh. I'm in the first week of employment on a green field project, and I figured I'd just sort of peck at a proposal for a software delivery pipeline over the weekend here. It's already ballooned up to 10 pages.
[07:56:50] <wroathe> I'm hesitant to even send it out to my new employer, because who wants a 10 page document dumped on them by the new guy (even if it is technically within my the scope of my role to do so)
[08:02:22] <theskillwithin> did you give opportunity for people to give feedback?
[08:02:46] <wroathe> It's a draft. I'll be sending it out to get the feedback.
[08:03:02] <wroathe> There's just a small group of us architects on this project to begin with.
[08:04:16] <theskillwithin> so you didn't write it alone?
[08:04:19] *** Joins: sam_1 (~sam_1@87.51.251.118)
[08:05:26] <wroathe> I did write it alone
[08:05:28] <wroathe> Over the weekend here
[08:05:39] <wroathe> I intended just to get something small out to them as a jumping off point
[08:05:50] <wroathe> But it has snowballed :P
[08:06:01] <theskillwithin> hmm that makes it a little trickier situation
[08:06:18] <wroathe> Oh?
[08:07:24] <theskillwithin> if you were writing it with more people,  and ur also giving people opportunity to give feedback, id be like, oh thats no problem at all.
[08:07:36] <wroathe> Well, it's not final
[08:07:48] <wroathe> It's definitely a draft, and they'll have the opportunity to give feedback
[08:07:56] <wroathe> (in fact, they're my superiors, and so they'll insist on giving feedback)

[08:10:55] <wroathe> Yup. There's only three of us. I think it'll be fine. The worst that can happen is that I'm met with ambivalence and they tell me that they've already considered all of this and decisions have been made already (although from the first week that didn't seem to be the case)
[08:11:33] <theskillwithin> right, takes time to feel people out so it is what it is
[08:12:24] <theskillwithin> 10 pages is a lot

[08:17:40] <theskillwithin> idk you may have gotten over excited, i feel like stuff like this usually starts with a meeting where people give input from the ground up
[08:19:18] <theskillwithin> basically i have no advice lol, idk
[08:19:40] <wroathe> I would argue that the best practice is basically this, but with maybe more restraint early on
[08:20:01] <wroathe> Technical decision meetings in my experience are usually very inefficient unless you're all working off of some kind of written proposal coming into the meeting.
[08:20:32] <theskillwithin> my fear is that it will feel too top-down,  when really the best teams like to figure out forthemselfs how they want to work
[08:20:35] <wroathe> It's too easy to fall into the trap of bikeshedding, and quibbling over unimportant details if there isn't some kind of document to refocus your attention back to the larger picture
[08:21:03] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Well, again, there's only three of us, and we're the decision makers on this project. We'll be staffing it with developers later on.
[08:21:37] <theskillwithin> with full time employees?

[08:31:20] <theskillwithin> im starting to worry i disagree with your leadership style

[08:32:57] <wroathe> Which part?
[08:33:42] <theskillwithin> you protested a bit too much at the meeting idea, im not sure, but that was a red flag for me
[08:34:39] <wroathe> I'm not against meetings. I'm against meetings without some kind of written proposal or agenda to work off of.
[08:35:04] <theskillwithin> ya maybe i took it not the way u meant
[08:36:01] <wroathe> Typically it's best for a proposal in a meeting to be a concise explanation of some of the options available. What I'm concerned about with my 10 page document is that it's not as concise as it should be, and covers too many far reaching ideas
[08:36:10] <wroathe> Like a 1 or 2 page document
[08:37:54] <wroathe> And also that this will be my second week

[08:40:18] <theskillwithin> my style is 80% listening, empower the team to choose how they want to work, try to have consensus.   not saying u disagree, i think i just mistook you earlier
[08:42:15] <theskillwithin> of course theres no devs to listen to yet haha
[08:43:21] <theskillwithin> so a new project, gotta spec things out before you hire.  or else its a catch-22
[08:46:17] <wroathe> theskillwithin: Yup. Ultimately though insisting on some kind of writing as a precursor to a technical decision meeting (from anyone, not just architects) is about discipline and avoiding unnecessary meetings.
[08:46:23] <wroathe> Nobody likes worthless meetings
[08:46:36] <wroathe> Well, except maybe middle management
[08:46:42] <theskillwithin> ya meetings suck
[08:49:31] <theskillwithin> I lucked out more than i deserve probably, I get the both of best worlds.  because now im working with devs iv worked with for like 5 years now, so we are on the same page with very little meetings

[12:24:54] <daedeloth> however, i also have some hardware that sets up a local gameserver, for conventions etc, on a local domain name

[13:58:05] <paule32> hello
[13:58:24] <paule32> can i .load a css file, that is execute by jquery ?
[13:59:05] <Cork> css isn't executable
[13:59:13] <paule32> also not only load, but inject code into the dom, which is execute by browser, and not only inserted
[13:59:14] <paule32> ?
[13:59:24] <Cork> its rules not code
[13:59:40] <paule32> yeah
[13:59:47] <Cork> so you would have to generate a dynamic stylesheet and load it into that
[14:00:07] <paule32> are the rules, that rules are processed ?
[14:00:09] <Cork> and that requires a complete recalculation of all elements in the page
[14:00:24] <Cork> it is processed by the browser ya
[14:00:38] <Cork> similarly to adding a firewall rule to your firewall
[14:00:39] <paule32> the situation:
[14:00:47] <paule32> i load a master page
[14:01:12] <paule32> then on mouse click on a div, i load .js, and .css code
[14:01:32] <Cork> recommended is to load the css you need statically
[14:01:34] <paule32> then, in my eyes, the loaded content is not processed, yet
[14:01:39] <Cork> as you can't ever unload css rules
[14:02:17] <paule32> but i can not determine, which css files are needed, in this project
[14:02:30] <paule32> at startuo
[14:02:37] <paule32> up
[14:02:51] <Cork> then you will have a hard time doing fragment navigation
[14:03:05] <Cork> as styles from one page will leak into another page
[14:03:21] <paule32> but possible ?
[14:03:40] <Cork> ya, if you go through the css and use ex. class to separate instead of files
[14:03:43] <Cork> else not really
[14:03:59] <paule32> ok
[14:04:15] <paule32> i assume ajax ?
[14:04:19] <Cork> as you have to unload the page to remove the unknown from the last page before loading the second one
[14:04:27] <Cork> and that is what the browser does by default
[14:04:36] <Cork> paule32: assuming loading into a running page
[14:04:38] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)
[14:04:44] <Cork> how you do it doesn't really matter
[14:04:48] <DPA> If a style tag is removed from te DOM, the associated style sheet is no longer applied to it. Those object are also subject to the gc, so css rules acrually can be unloaded.
[14:05:29] <theskillwithin> thats not the problem, its adding not subtracting
[14:05:43] <Cork> well both are
[14:06:03] <Cork> you will have bad performance if you inject a new stylesheet as the browser has to reevaluate everything
[14:06:13] <Cork> same for removing
[14:06:14] <paule32> js knows ctor's, its knowing dtor's ?
[14:06:30] <theskillwithin> idk if thats even possible Cork
[14:06:41] <paule32> the .css instead for other elements, not the document itself
[14:06:47] <Cork> theskillwithin: if what is?
[14:07:12] <theskillwithin> "injecting" a stylesheet
[14:07:32] <Cork> it is document.stylesheets can create new stylesheets
[14:07:36] <theskillwithin> if i inject a script tag on a page after its loaded, i don't expect that script tag to run
[14:07:37] <Cork> but the performance is horrible

[14:09:14] <theskillwithin> Cork ya you see what i mean
[14:09:35] <electrostatic> I usually try to keep the stylesheets static and update element classes with jquery instead
[14:09:37] <paule32> how do you so, to handle a bunch of global variables - many in large projects ?
[14:10:00] <paule32> did you use a class, or a object, in which you store the informations ?
[14:10:09] <Cork> paule32: in preprocessing set a class infront of each rule for the page it is meant for, for example
[14:10:16] <theskillwithin> im surprised with how many people use jquery still here
[14:10:21] <Cork> or better yet go through and optimize them

[14:11:09] <theskillwithin> oof i feel bad for ya
[14:11:34] <paule32> why not jquery, not good, to big ?

[14:12:03] <electrostatic> not fancy, but stable
[14:12:18] <Cork> paule32: it is barly maintained, close to all of it has been implemented in standard dom now days

[14:41:24] <paule32> when i store the .css data of a .css file into a .php file
[14:41:36] <paule32> .php is served from the server, ok
[14:42:02] <paule32> but is the content (css rules) served by page ?
[14:42:12] <paule32> also, know the browser what to do ?
[14:42:45] <paule32> if you give the browser the message, to load .css file, then it would be load the file, and process it
[14:43:05] <paule32> but, what is when the file is a .css.php file ?
[14:43:15] <paule32> does this in tripple mode?
[14:43:38] <theskillwithin> no, i don't think you can arbitrarily add more .css files.  the .css files are processed by the browser from the original page load

[19:45:35] <teut> is this thing the  abstraction or encapsulation?

[22:20:27] <lantech19446> hey so I'm learning javascript and last night was the class on strings and at least a few string functions. I'm just wondering if anyone has any real world examples of when I would need to count the length of a string or find a certain character in a string etc

[22:22:55] <GreenJello> they're small building blocks of actual solutions to problems, not really something noteworthy
[22:23:55] <GreenJello> you might check a string length when validating an id or username, for example
[22:24:19] <lantech19446> ok so like complexity requirements if it's less than x length don't take it
[22:24:36] *** Quits: night_wulfe (~wulfe@cpe-174-103-156-213.cinci.res.rr.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:25:24] <GreenJello> not sure what you mean by that
[22:25:42] <GreenJello> but string.length is somewhat limited in where it's useful

[22:26:24] <systemfault> if (password.length < 3 || password.length > 25) { alert('Passwords should be between 3 and 25 characters') }
[22:26:24] <lantech19446> in other words if someone says in order to register your username or password must be more than x characters you could use string.length and feed it into a loop which would determine whether they're able to register or not
[22:26:30] <GreenJello> it's fine if you know the string is only basic ascii, though

[22:26:51] <lantech19446> yea like i understood the lesson I just couldn't see any practical use for it and was curious
[22:27:07] <celphi> yes usernames have max lengths
[22:27:12] <celphi> same as min lengths
[22:27:23] <celphi> and passwords do too in real world
[22:27:37] <celphi> lots of things do
[22:27:45] <GreenJello> but it's somewhat arbitrary to limit it by ucs2 code units
[22:28:17] <celphi> usually when you store data in a database the field has a max length so you want to enforce that
[22:29:35] <celphi> also i wouldnt be doing the validation on client side- i would have the basic limits in the html but do validation on server side
[22:30:03] <lantech19446> ok
[22:31:03] <celphi> ie <input type="text" min="3" max="5" required> works just fine
[22:31:18] <lantech19446> I'm learning this mostly for web development but being able to script in it would be nice too. The first time I tried to learn it I was deep in depression and failed miserably this time I feel like i can actually do it
[22:31:35] <lantech19446> nice

[22:35:29] <teut> inside the map
[22:35:30] <teut> thanks
[22:36:02] <celphi> is there a cleaner way of inserting a clone node before another node? insertBefore requires parent node

[22:51:04] <teut> how can I do something like this in material ui, without using BEM?
[22:51:33] <DPA> ljharb: As to why I used sha1 browser side, it's complicated. I'm not actually doing it to encrypt anything. I happen to have a message queue of sorts in my DB (just a table), that my webserver instances broadcasts to subscribed websocket clients.
[22:51:33] <DPA> I reused it in the DB to send notifications about some things changing using DB triggers later. However, the thing subscribed to is a URL, I can't encode things just before sending, the DB doesn't have a URL encode thing, and there can be URL unsafe components in there. But the DB supports SHA1, so I ended up using that.
[22:51:33] <DPA> On the client side, I just hash it using SHA1 the same way, so the paths match up. It may be technically wrong, but it's good enough for real world use, and trying to change any of it would just make it suck in different ways, so it's just going to stay like that.
[22:51:42] <teut> sorry its confusing
[22:52:15] <ljharb> DPA: why not just use an npm package then, rather than relying on web crypto
[22:52:57] <teut> ok , so what is the better way of writing this code ?

[22:57:18] <DPA> ljharb: I ended up doing that now. (took the sha-1 package). But I try to have as few untrusted dependencies as possible. Thankfully, sha1 is simple & small, so I could just checked the distributed code to see it does only what it says this time around.

[23:02:28] <ljharb> third party deps are way more trustworthy, statistically, than first-party ones :-)
