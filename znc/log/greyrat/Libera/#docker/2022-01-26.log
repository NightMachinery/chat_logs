[00:18:44] <jamiejackson> probably a dumb question, but it's taken this long for it to come up for me. in AWS, i have ARM-based EC2s available that I can run as docker hosts. however, i've been running on x86-64 hosts in the past. how much attention do i need to pay to the architecture of the host in the docker world?
[00:20:29] <ikke> jamiejackson: depends on the things you want to run on it
[00:20:47] <ikke> The images you want to use need to be built for arch you want to run on
[00:21:04] <ikke> You cannot use an amd64 image on an armv8 host
[00:22:50] <jamiejackson> i guess most vendor images default to x86-64, and i guess i happen to have been running on the same arch hosts and so i never gave other architectures much thought in the context of docker
[00:23:28] <jamiejackson> what happens if you have a mismatched image/host? does it bomb or are there potentially subtle side effects?
[00:25:10] <ikke> jamiejackson: it would just not run
[00:25:16] <ikke> exec format error
[00:26:44] <jamiejackson> interesting. so if someone is running docker, on, say, an amd64 laptop, do they constantly have to explicitly specify that the images they are pulling or FROMing are amd64?
[00:27:24] <ikke> no
[00:27:37] <ikke> docker by default pulls images for the architecture it was compiled for
[00:30:01] <jamiejackson> this is blowing my mind for some reason. so if a developer with an amd laptop were to build an image and push it to our repo, and i were to pull/FROM it on my x86-64 laptop just by its normal tag, what would happen? would the pull fail?

[12:47:30] <freakynl> Not sure, seems I need to set HTTPS_PROXY as env on the docker service, but last time I did that it propagated to the containers. As we have a lot of containers in varying IP space and frequently using names which we don't know beforehand excluding stuff is quite hard. Setting it last time broke a lot of stuff because the containers started using the proxies for their internal http traffic

[19:13:29] <shad> Hi, on a Linux host, i'm trying to mount an USB drive onto a running container volume. If I mount the drive, then start the container, the files are there. If i first start the container, then mount the usb drive onto the volume, the files don't show up in the container, but they are there in the linux host. Any idea why ?

[19:51:14] <ph88^> when i pull image with tag latest do i automatically get alternative tags for the same image ? i want to re-upload to another registry
[19:52:24] <programmerq> when you pull, you are pulling exactly one tag
[19:52:51] <programmerq> there can be many tags that happen to point to the same blobs, but pull doesn't discover what those are.
[19:53:18] <programmerq> there's also 'docker pull -a ...' which will pull all images associated with a given registry, but that may not be what you want.
[19:54:07] <programmerq> there's a tool called 'reg' that makes it a little easier to programmatically interact with the registry api, and you can build a list of tags you're interested in with a shell script.
[19:54:50] <programmerq> If you want to set up a procedure that runs periodically, you can use skopeo to copy things between registries without having a running dockerd. It also lets you skip the uncompress and recompress steps (I believe it does, anyway)
[19:56:00] <programmerq> deuxexmachina: you could have lots of in-use images, you could have stopped containers that are using those images. you could have containers that have lots of data in their write layers.

[20:29:17] <rawtaz> akik: i bet. did you try it?
[20:29:36] <ph88^> i pulled an image on a server where i have ssh access to. How can i download this image to my own pc and make it managed by docker ?
[20:29:48] <rawtaz> hm does one have to update the *images* or is this a kernel thing so one only needs to patch the docker host?
[20:30:08] <akik> rawtaz: yes, first thing i found the exploit code
[20:30:27] <akik> rawtaz: https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c
[20:30:33] <ikke> it's pkexec that is vulnerable, which is a suid binary
[20:30:38] <ikke> so yes it would work inside docker
[20:31:15] <rawtaz> ok so one has to patch not only the docker host then
[20:31:21] <akik> chmod u-s /bin/pkexec works around the issue

[20:32:18] <rawtaz> ikke: i have no idea, i am asking. i never used polkit afaik
[20:32:23] <rawtaz> i dont know what it is or where it is :)
[20:32:27] <rawtaz> i just learnt about this thing
[20:32:55] <akik> i have polkit inside a docker container because i let users login to the container
[20:32:59] <ikke> It's a policy daemon that graphical programs use to esalate privileges so that they do not have to be root
[20:33:07] <ikke> akik: I'm sorry
[20:33:25] <rawtaz> ikke: considering that most docker containers install userland stuff i would expect that theres a risk this thing was in there as well - just imagine what an apt update and then a few apt install runs does when building an image, it pulls it way more than the specific software you asked
[20:33:27] <ikke> It uses javascript rules to define policy
[20:33:48] <ikke> It's basically one big vulnerability engine
