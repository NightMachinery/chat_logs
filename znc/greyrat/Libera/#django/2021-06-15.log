[00:10:08] <teut> I get the queryset  of the model , I add extra fields's  data to the queryset through .anotate
[00:10:18] <teut> but django just rejects that data

[00:11:12] <teut> can someone just tell where exactly you are creating  the initial data of the  form , from the   model instance?
[00:11:52] <teut> you should use     self.form_class._meta.fields where there should be then  self.model._meta.fields
[00:13:11] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: https://dpaste.org/bNim
[00:14:52] <GinFuyou> Ok, so there is no errors now? It just misses storing the email?
[00:14:56] <blackleitus> why it gets ? https://dpaste.org/9es7#L53 `"Vulnerability.cvss_v2" must be a "Cvss2" instance.`
[00:16:58] <GinFuyou> blackleitus, because data where you pull it from looks to be a plain dict, no instances
[00:17:13] <GinFuyou> model ones I mean
[00:17:45] <blackleitus> how should it be ? +GinFuyou
[00:18:16] <blackleitus> I mean vuln is linkd to cvss2 and 3 , but why not instance?
[00:18:47] <GinFuyou> Django can't know it from just a dictionary
[00:19:33] <GinFuyou> So if you want to save a relation, you provide an instance of corresponding model. New one or fetched existing one
[00:20:09] <rannnn8888> someone can help how i write this it the django ? https://dpaste.org/K27i
[00:20:16] <GinFuyou> so probably you want to pre-process your data. run get_or_create() maybe

[00:26:52] <wallbroken> when an user updates the email address, the new one must be verified in order to avoid any typo and the user is unable to recover the account
[00:30:31] <GinFuyou> yes, for that we have to store new email somehow, since it's not applied immediately
[00:30:41] <GinFuyou> I've mentioned it
[00:31:25] <hylje> you now have a many-to-one relationship between emails and users
[00:31:31] <GinFuyou> As most simple (but not perfect) solution I picked is to use session
[00:32:07] <GinFuyou> hylje, yes, it would be a better solution. But it requires a change in model structure

[02:00:53] <teut> then your another view which will allow the form to fill that form can just rendar that uploaded file
[02:01:15] <teut> you will have to make the model dynamiclly
[02:01:31] <teut> I made one last year, that is not difficult
[02:02:02] <teut> so lets say your client uploaded the html file

[02:04:58] <hoppity> I will look into this solution and report back

[04:36:41] <FunkyBob> I want to understand the full plan of the goal... not the half-implemented views
[04:37:23] <wallbroken> when an user updates the email address, the new one must be verified in order to avoid any typo and the user is unable to recover the account
[04:37:46] <wallbroken> AND
[04:37:55] <wallbroken> i want a check that that mail is unique
[04:38:18] <FunkyBob> ok... so, that's a good "user story" level description
[04:38:26] <wallbroken> if the email has been user on some other acocunt, the user should be not allowed to use
[04:38:50] <FunkyBob> here's an idea... use that websequencediagram site I linked earlier... to show step-by-step what needs to happen
[04:38:50] <wallbroken> email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

[05:32:33] <FunkyBob> THE WHOLE PROCESS

[05:33:43] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: the {{}} parts are only processed on the server... so no, the timer will do nothing

[05:48:01] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: if you want it to update, your best choice is probably to implement a view that returns the data in JSON format
[05:48:42] <FunkyBob> so instead of embedding the data in your template, your JS fetches it on load and periodically
[05:49:38] <wallbroken> so, you don't want to make an example?
[05:50:34] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob something like this ? if i send json its automatic ? no in the side server ?https://dpaste.org/9eTj

[05:53:59] <FunkyBob> I can't give you working code until you describe properly what you're trying to implement... so we have a clear definition of "working"
[05:54:10] <FunkyBob> because we've tried this before, then you've bitched and moaned about it not being what you wanted
[05:54:15] <FunkyBob> so I'm not making that mistake again
[05:54:23] <wallbroken> now i have a working code, but without mail verification
[05:54:26] <FunkyBob> instead, I tried to help you learn to do things better...
[05:54:27] <wallbroken> mail verification is the problem
[05:56:19] <FunkyBob> it really isn't
[05:56:38] <wallbroken> yes it is
[05:56:48] <wallbroken> because the form without the verification works well
[05:56:56] <wallbroken> the problem is to implement the verification
[05:57:23] <wallbroken> if it was C# i would already done in 5 minutes
[05:57:43] <FunkyBob> but to do that in C#, you'd have to first describe the steps needed
[05:57:55] <FunkyBob> and as we've established... you're unable to even understand that idea, let alone implement it
[05:58:26] <FunkyBob> this has nothing to do with the programming language, from what I can see
[05:59:02] <wallbroken> the idea is that we need to match che token sent into the email
[05:59:10] <wallbroken> a token is a random base64 hash
[05:59:21] <FunkyBob> that's a tiny fragment of your solution
[05:59:27] <wallbroken> and when the use clicks on it in the mailbox, a request has done to the server
[05:59:31] <FunkyBob> just one detail of one step
[05:59:45] <wallbroken> vhe view must get the request and check a comparison between tokens
[05:59:59] <FunkyBob> that's another step... now, gather all of these steps together... and put them in a single document... in order
[06:00:08] <wallbroken> if the verifications comes right, the view could go on in updating the email
[06:00:14] <FunkyBob> fucks sake
[06:00:30] <FunkyBob> "I can't do the thing.... so I'll do the thing... on IRC, instead of in a persistent document like you asked"

[08:33:35] <FunkyBob> then explicitly follow the fkey joins instead of the m2m perhaps?
[08:33:43] <FunkyBob> it would help to understand what you really need in the end
[08:33:54] <FunkyBob> rather than try to decipher this solution you've proposed
[08:34:33] <Safa_[A_boy]> What I need is access to the intermediate table without breaking the m2m join, and without doing a prefetch to just get that intermediate instances
[08:35:04] <Safa_[A_boy]> I mean I don't want to do: person.memberships.select_related('group') since this will just mess up all serializers and views

[12:27:01] <Safa_[A_boy]> FunkyBob, Hmm... I used annotate, but because some fields that I need have extra validation/wrappers, it won't work out that way. I tried FilteredRelation and it did the trick, although it duplicated the join (understandable because of how these things are complicated)
[12:28:25] <FunkyBob> ah, yes, I keep forgetting about FilteredRelation because it was added after I stopped regularly using django
[12:29:09] <FunkyBob> noobsec: yeh, should be simple enough... use something like requests or httpx to make the requests
[12:29:42] <FunkyBob> pycode: this is where docker makes (some) things easier... as you can rebuild the docker image, test it works, then deploy it atomically
[12:30:35] <pycode> FunkyBob, oh really can i deploy it atomically? but what happen on the things on servers like redis, postgresql
[12:30:55] <pycode> when i deploy atomically does it mean that i should upload all the things like databse too ?
[12:34:00] <pycode> FunkyBob, maybe Fabric, ANsible?
[12:34:12] <FunkyBob> pycode: redis, postgres... run in separate containers
[12:34:32] <FunkyBob> so you can deploy your code as a whole container image... remembering to run migrate when needed
[12:35:29] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon for asking, but if i have a container for postgres anther for redis ...another for celery etc... then when i deploy my image with the website i need to run commands like migrations (as you said), collectstatics etc
[12:35:43] <pycode> how can i run those command when i deploy it atomically?
[12:36:11] <hylje> depends on your deployment infrastructure
[12:36:24] <FunkyBob> you can run collectstatic as part of your build process... reminds me, was going to write more on using multi-target builds to produce nginx+static and django images
[12:36:46] <FunkyBob> the atomicity is in that you're not taking a running instance, pulling new code, which it may then start using...
[12:37:36] <pycode> ok but then in eed to run migrations that are referring to a different docker instance
[12:37:40] <pycode> so i must run that on server

[13:17:02] <pgcd> yes, it does return the PK but, unfortunately "On databases that support it (all but Oracle), setting the ignore_conflicts parameter to True tells the database to ignore failure to insert any rows that fail constraints such as duplicate unique values. Enabling this parameter disables setting the primary key on each model instance (if the database
[13:17:02] <pgcd> normally supports it)."
[13:18:07] <pgcd> so I may be misinterpreting it but the pk is not set on the saved instances, and I'm not sure I can get to that mapping

[14:42:37] <hoover> Morning all
[14:42:45] <teut> However, with model formsets, the initial values only apply to extra forms, those that aren’t attached to an existing model instance.
[14:42:48] <FunkyBob> morning, hoover
[14:43:00] <FunkyBob> teut: how do you figure that?
[14:43:05] <teut> your docs say this and I m stuck on it from 5 days when I didnt read it
[14:43:09] <FunkyBob> the code certainly doesn't agree
[14:43:21] <FunkyBob> where do the docs say that?
[14:43:32] <teut> I tried to dive in your source but its  too much confusing
[14:43:45] <teut> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/#id2
[14:43:46] <teut> here
[14:44:18] <teut> I coudnt find where do you prepare initial data from the queryset
[14:44:42] <FunkyBob> hmm

[14:45:12] <teut> or just think yourself, how would you create a checkbox table ,
[14:45:14] <hoover> I have a question regarding the layout of forms in Django 2.2.x... I have two large select boxes with many entries that'd I'd like to display next to each other on the input page instead of on top of each other, can this be done with some sort of form.as_xxx function?
[14:45:24] <FunkyBob> that doc doesn't seem to gel with my reading of the code
[14:45:33] <FunkyBob> what happens if you try passing a list of initial dicts to the formset?
[14:45:50] <teut> a listview with checkboxes  in the  left side corresponding to each entry
[14:46:06] <FunkyBob> that seems to be an awful lot of code to shoe-horn a formset into a CBV
[14:46:09] <teut> I pass queryset  with initial
[14:46:20] <FunkyBob> surely writing a plain function would be simpler?

[14:46:41] <teut> no , it won't be and I can explaiin that even
[14:47:32] <FunkyBob> your initial only has one item in the list... how long is the queryset result?
[14:48:41] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ded411e47c9b53f996a0cd2393aa5ccb/image.png
[14:48:49] <teut> so this the the kind of form
[14:49:10] <FunkyBob> and the form class again? what's the non-model f ield?
[14:49:12] <teut> the user has full right to navigate between pages and tick the boxes
[14:49:17] <FunkyBob> print_report_check?
[14:49:21] <teut> yes
[14:49:29] <FunkyBob> then that should be the only field in initial
[14:49:43] <teut> hmm, does that mean that?
[14:49:45] <FunkyBob> don't put PAN_ID in there too
[14:50:23] <teut> after the user clicks next , I save the true values of checked corresponding to the PAN_ID
[14:50:25] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/models.py#L303 <-- inital values take precedence over model values
[14:50:48] <FunkyBob> you're trying to do a paginated multi-select, yes?
[14:51:21] <teut> yes

[14:51:48] <teut> and I m doing it the safe way , not stupid javascript stuff
[14:52:10] <teut> there you just send a json and receive one
[14:52:17] <FunkyBob> I'd store a set of selected PKs in the users session
[14:52:28] <teut> I did that earlier
[14:52:51] <teut> but then anyone can  add fields to it
[14:52:59] <FunkyBob> only if you do it wrong.
[14:53:05] <teut> why so?
[14:53:07] <FunkyBob> how can they add fields to it?
[14:53:20] <teut> using  form.preeventDefault in js
[14:53:36] <FunkyBob> and?
[14:53:40] <pycode> ok thanks FunkyBob hylje !
[14:53:43] <FunkyBob> django will still ignore anything it doesn't know
[14:54:26] <teut> thinking
[14:54:27] <FunkyBob> hoover: django doesn't really care how you render your forms... but the docs do cover doing fine grained rendering using the form helpers
[14:54:45] <FunkyBob> teut: anyway, how does it go if you only pass  the non-field value in initial?
[14:55:00] <teut> I will have to try that before saying
[14:55:05] <FunkyBob> hoover: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/#rendering-fields-manually
[14:55:08] <FunkyBob> teut: wise
[14:55:42] <FunkyBob> you'll also need a way to pull out the right flag for the records in the current queryset
[14:56:49] <teut> right flag?
[14:57:03] <teut> oh you mean the tick
[14:57:04] <teut> ?
[14:57:18] <teut> well , did you see my  formset_valid()   method?

[15:30:37] <teut> it's good but not so good

[15:31:03] <mihael> teut can you expand on that
[15:31:35] <teut> well it just says to use  extra fields as a proxy model
[15:31:52] <teut> whats your exact goal?
[15:32:31] <mihael> In my app, a user can be a: Athlete, Coach, Admin, normal User. A user can only have one role
[15:32:34] <teut> multiple users is not just sufficient thing to use proxy , or multi table inheritance
[15:32:55] <mihael> teut Can I get your thoughts on how to best approach that?
[15:33:00] <teut> and what do they have a common attribute?
[15:33:04] <teut> and do*
[15:33:28] <mihael> teut the credentials
[15:33:40] <mihael> teut I mean the email, username, password
[15:34:18] <teut> to store the extra fields , you can use  AtheleteExtra,  CoachExtra  and so on.
[15:34:29] <teut> or do what I have done
[15:34:40] <teut> I have used multi table inheritance
[15:35:15] <mihael> I'm pretty new to all this, can you point me to a documentation on how to implement that?

[15:38:38] <teut> I dont know
[15:39:02] <teut> if you just have users , you always have to check their type attribute
[15:39:26] <teut> and then you will have to use  the permissions

[20:01:51] <pgcd> pycode you don't need to set the hostname in static_url - if you just use '/static/' it'll have the same result and possibly save you some headache

[20:04:00] <GinFuyou> pgcd, problem is that pycode browser seem to access static over https by default
[20:04:02] <pgcd> as for the https question, you should be able to force http by visiting http://yoursite.local/  (ie. explicitly setting the protocol in the address) and making sure you don't have add-ons or django middleware that redirects to https
[20:04:15] <pycode> it works without putting the entire http....
[20:04:48] <pycode> funny things
[20:04:51] <pycode> the problem is:
[20:05:15] <pycode> 1. if i put the entire URL with http schema i only can use 127.0.0.1 and all works as expected...but if i put mywebsite.local NO
[20:05:17] <pgcd> also,  instead of python manage.py runserver  mywebsite.local:8000 you could try  python manage.py runserver 0:8000
[20:05:35] <pgcd> and then visit with the host of your choice

[20:06:43] <pycode> just 127.0.0.1 is working

[20:15:17] <pgcd> pycode i don't know what middleware might be redirecting but you can start by opening http://mywebsite.local:8000/ in your browser with the devtools network tab open, to see if it's actually a redirect or if it's cached as https for some reason

[20:26:23] <pycode> but https on mywebsite.local is not working
[20:26:24] <pycode> i do not know
[20:30:14] <pycode> pgcd, with more project i think i need to change the port

[20:30:41] <pycode> on dev.
[20:32:07] <pycode> however yes the problem is chrome because it is always requesting https if the host is not 127.0.0.1

[20:44:26] <pgcd> i wouldn't use a middleware to redirect to https, that's more of a web server (or load balancer) job, imho
[20:45:23] <pgcd> also, i think you need to use some package to make runserver accept https, or use some sort of reverse proxy, so I'd avoid it unless you have a very strong reason to

[23:42:42] <hylje> gillzon: either plug your site database to a reporting dashboard app or come up with a simple way to store and/or cache the stats you want and generate them offline with a celery task or crontab
[23:44:02] <gillzon> hylje, thanks!
[23:45:19] <hylje> the former is ideal if you don't know what kind of stats you want in advance and /or you have another person in your team to deal with it

[23:45:54] <hylje> latter if you have relatively boring stats and don't want to deal with integrating/maintaining some fancy service that does about 200% as much as you need
[23:48:02] <knbk> gillzon: don't forget the first step if you haven't done that already: measure the performance to decide if you actually need a more complex solution. Databases are pretty fast, especially with the right indexes
