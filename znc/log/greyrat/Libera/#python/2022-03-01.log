[01:04:53] <Guest54> the issue is, these str -> list[str] pairs come from an api and users pass this data into my cli app
[01:04:54] <SnoopJ> click doesn't have anything that helps with this right out of the box, but if you're willing to disallow the space in there, you can do stringy things and then do some parsing of your own
[01:04:58] <phy1729> shells and complex data structures don't really get along
[01:05:12] <phy1729> Guest54: would a pipe between the two be doable?
[01:05:20] <SnoopJ> (or if the user is willing to escape/quote their spaces, I guess)

[01:07:09] <Guest54> ah ok

[01:13:20] <SnoopJ> oh, nevermind, nargs=-1 doesn't work for options
[01:13:26] <Guest54> SnoopJ that would not be ideal, because there are more arguments to the cli. So for eg:  python3 foo.py --kvpairs key1=foo,bar key2=baz,wut --another_arg 10
[01:13:48] <SnoopJ> Guest54, the problem with the syntax you want is that there's no way to tell where the data that goes with --kvpairs ends
[01:14:43] <nedbat> i'm a little surprised at people's revulsion to this surprising capability: https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/1498310018218676229  to me, that code neatly expresses what it needed to do.
[01:14:44] <SnoopJ> Guest54, how about `--kvpairs "key1=foo,bar key2=baz,wut"`? Note that the "" resolve the problem I just mentioned
[01:15:14] <Guest54> that would be great :)
[01:15:32] <Guest54> yes it would be perfect - does click support this?
[01:15:51] <SnoopJ> not directly, but that commandline syntax should make it possible to do with a little extra code

[05:51:07] <twb> TML: what I'm saying is, I'm not actually complaining "why isn't Python Common Lisp?" I'm complaining "this problem was solved 30 years ago, why are you still screwing up?"
[05:51:16] <TML> twb: I don't know who pays for YOU to develop Python full-time so you have infinite hours to do research on prior art across all other languages and their potential libraries before you put something out in the field, but I can tell you no one is paying for MINE, so yes: I often put code out there without having had any chance to "Study the prior art"
[05:51:40] <nedbat> twb: the mistake is using strings for regexes?

[05:52:28] <twb> nedbat: well my original complaint is that in Python, path and path component objects are weakly typed (i.e. just strings), and pathlib doesn't fully fix this.
[05:52:30] <TML> Strings are the biggest, broadest hammer I have, so I often just have to solve it with a string and call it good enough and move on

[05:54:09] <twb> TML: I don't mind if you do that in your initial implementation.  By the time it becomes a standard library that ships with CPython, I have higher expectations.
[05:54:32] <TML> twb: Having expectations of open source projects is setting yourself up for disappointment

[08:19:12] <willow> following the basic example at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#example   argparse.ArgumentParser().parse_args() is a 'Namespace object': a 'basic object subclass'.    they define a custom dest 'accumulate' which they assign methods 'sum' and 'max'.   where do sum and max get inherited from?

[11:57:43] <matsaman> twb: tedious =)
[11:58:08] <matsaman> more familiar with Django (where jinja is admittedly nicer than the default), but
[11:58:31] <twb> I would obviously prefer METAL
[11:58:37] <matsaman> no layperson are actually dealing with these templates, so most of the time I don't know why we bother
[11:58:44] <matsaman> laypersons*
[11:58:55] <twb> But inside a web engine, jinja isn't so bad, because you can always write python to mangle before it gets to jinja
[11:59:42] <twb> matsaman: in the sense of "why use a template engine at all", it's so escaping works correctly without having to add php_no_really_escape() around every variable
[11:59:58] <twb> matsaman: of course, if you use shit template languages like mako, then escaping is off by default
[12:00:12] <matsaman> I mean in Django you still have to add filters similar to that sometimes
[12:00:21] <twb> matsaman: of course, if you use shit temlpate languages like jinja, it doesn't understand the XML, so you have to manually pick which escape sometimes
[12:00:24] <matsaman> and they really, really don't want you to use real python in the templates

[12:00:40] <twb> matsaman: you should look at METAL
[12:00:42] <matsaman> even though you can hack it through some of the default filters usually
[12:00:54] <matsaman> lookin' at it now
[12:00:58] <twb> matsaman: it's properly embedded so the escaping semantics are always well-defined
[12:01:16] <twb> Of course you cannot use it for HTML because the whatwg broke html
[12:01:30] <matsaman> the WHATWG in particular did? =)
[12:01:32] <twb> So nowadays, html uses its own serialization that is incomplatible with everything else
[12:01:35] <twb> matsaman: yes
[12:01:40] <matsaman> yeah I guess that's true
[12:01:52] <twb> HTML4 was based on SGML.  XHTML was based on XML.  HTML5 is based on... itself.
[12:01:54] <matsaman> too bad the W3C caved so hard

My thoughts go somewhere in the direction of `texts, intents = d['text'], d['intent'] for d in json_array` but this doesn't work. I can do it in a for-loop, but I can't get my head around doing it in a list comp. maybe it's just
[12:54:45] <Luyin> not possible, but it's probably just that I've got rusty with python :D

[17:56:34] <zamba> is there a way i can map where in the code the script consumes the most time?

[17:56:51] <hodapp> this is what profiling is, e.g. see cProfile
[17:57:07] <supakeen> You can reverse 8 bits with `b = (b & 0xF0) >> 4 | (b & 0x0F) << 4; b = (b & 0xCC) >> 2 | (b & 0x33) << 2; b = (b & 0xAA) >> 1 | (b & 0x55) << 1;` which is easily expandable for wider numbers.
[17:57:26] <hodapp> this is true too
[17:57:33] <zamba> supakeen: that does exactly what my previous code did?
[17:57:38] <zamba> even though it's not as readable :)

[18:57:28] <SnoopJ> Right, and the CLA is the way you formally say "I'm cool with that"

[20:18:08] <euouae> hello, what is code that does not define anything called in a python file?
[20:18:09] <han-solo> zodd: sure, but you are not saving anything, just import it again
[20:18:18] <euouae> e.g. something like `x = 1 + 1`.
[20:18:19] <han-solo> so it is more explicit
[20:18:25] <euouae> or rather, something like `f()`
[20:18:48] <xx> f.readline() f.readline() f.readlines() it is not explained why .readline() advances the line for .readlines(). I'd expect f.readlines() to read the whole file again, irrelevant of how many times f.readline() was called before
[20:18:59] <SnoopJ> euouae, are you asking about statements that aren't assignment statements?
[20:19:09] <xx> is that just something to know, or am I missing it somewhere on https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html

[20:19:59] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[20:20:02] <SnoopJ> xx, they both read from wherever the stream currently is, so if you call readline(), the location in the stream has been advanced, and a subsequent readlines() call will only see lines from that point on.
[20:20:10] <SnoopJ> euouae, all statements run code
[20:20:12] <pycurious> I'm writing a program in Python that runs forever and randomly receives requests that have to be processed in parallel. Each request can take dozens of minutes to process and puts some burden on the CPU, so asyncio is not an option. For each request I start a new worker process. - Is there an elegant way to solve this in Python?
[20:20:22] <SnoopJ> uh, except the pass statement :)
[20:20:36] <euouae> SnoopJ sure, but can you understand what I mean? I'm trying to explain to someone that code such as `call f()` should not be committed into files that are imported
[20:20:38] <NoImNotNineVolt> pycurious: multiprocessing, Pool?
[20:20:47] <SnoopJ> euouae, no, not really
[20:20:58] <euouae> SnoopJ def f(): ... then f()
[20:21:10] <han-solo> `concurrent.futures` has nice apis
[20:21:15] <NoImNotNineVolt> or that.
[20:21:25] <euouae> the person tested the file with `python3 file.py`, but I'm trying to tell him that there's better solutions, plus you don't need to commit that f() clal
[20:21:28] <rvalue> what is the closest thing of this in python? https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparing-java.util.function.Function-java.util.Comparator-
[20:21:47] <han-solo> but requests are IO, so why not asyncio ?
[20:21:51] <SnoopJ> euouae, that sounds like you need to have a conversation with them about the fact that importing a file runs all of the code in it

[20:25:39] <SnoopJ> euouae, but it sounds like your concern has to do with the *semantics* of the code, not its syntax.
[20:25:48] <pycurious> NoImNotNineVolt: how do you use Pool, when requests come one after the other?
[20:26:23] <nedbat> rvalue: you can define a comparing function cmp(v1, v2),  then:  max(sequence, key=functools.cmp_to_key(cmp))   https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key

[20:33:42] <euouae> nedbat, but it's not a funcdef
[20:34:14] <euouae> It's not necessary to explain to my collab what the grammar is, it was just a curiosity of mine
[20:34:18] <nedbat> euouae: i'm not sure there's a word for "import, class, def, or constant assignments" which is what are ok at the top-level of a module.

[21:06:03] <exarkun> faceface: Do you _have_ to?  No.  _Should_ you?  Yes.
[21:06:12] <SnoopJ> Jong, sometimes it is, but it's not a "you should never do it any other way" thing. I have actually never used the context manager support of np.load()
[21:06:15] <faceface> ChrisWarrick: that's correct
[21:06:18] <SnoopJ> (I'm not even sure I *knew* about it)
[21:06:21] <exarkun> faceface: Why are you reluctant?
[21:06:29] <ChrisWarrick> faceface: seems like a mess
[21:06:40] <ChrisWarrick> faceface: are both running the same pytest and python versions?
[21:06:43] <faceface> exarkun: because I'm developing this one project...

[23:32:22] <Guest2141> hi there! when I first started programing in Python people would scare me with the following statement "global variables are dangerous". I think they can be dangerous enough. It boils down to HOW and WHERE you use them. I understand the potential side effects and I understand that it might not go along the lines of functional programming but guess
[23:32:22] <Guest2141> what python is not purely functional, is a multi paradigm programming language. When we do "from math import e" thats global, function and classes definitions are usually global (module-level).  The danger comes from the fact that you can change that global variable from inside a function and that might have side effects hard to track down, let
[23:32:23] <Guest2141> alone the fact that you might be using multiprocessing. However the fact that you have to use global to do reassignments puts a bar against side effects. You still might a have a global custom class object and have some setters and have implicit side effects, be a responsible adult. I think when it comes to just reading the state of an object I
[23:32:23] <Guest2141> don't see anything wrong with global. When it comes to updating then you gotta think twice. Another use case might be a remote API connection like a spark context, DB connection, HTTP API or REST API. You might want to share that "connection state" across your module. You can do that using as a module level variable. I think that's better than
[23:32:24] <Guest2141> passing it down across your different functions or methods. (Smaller headers. Code less cluttered) Also some people might try to define a class so you can encapsulate that global state. I feel like global state encapsulation is awesome but if I have solely that reason to make a class I don't find it appealing enough. However is something that we
[23:32:24] <Guest2141> should keep in mind. I dont know, I feel like if your module is not super big, the way to go is to creating that module level variable and use it in your functions.

[23:51:26] <xheimlich> I think what's a fact and what's a metaphysical but unknowable given is kind of an issue of scope. If you place computers in the loop, the fact that a string is programmatically generated can be verified by running the program again. If you're looking just at the strings, you can never know.
