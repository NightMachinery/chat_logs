[09:50:48] <epilys> django ORM on its own could not deal with a graph, its generated queries overflowed the sqlite parser

[11:19:02] <quanticle> companion_cube: "Make sexprs not m4"
[11:21:12] <jjuran> If you write `# Comment here` in M4, it doesn't get interpreted but it does pass through to the output.
[11:21:41] <jjuran> To write an actual line comment that gets output-suppressed, that's `dnl Comment here`
[11:22:48] <jjuran> Oh, and I guess I can't use backticks to quote M4 syntax in general

[16:32:30] <Brekkjern> Whenever there's a post from soatok on the site I feel dumb...
[16:33:01] <riv> oh the crypto stuff?
[16:33:59] <Brekkjern> YYeah
[16:34:24] <riv> cypto is always like that
[16:34:39] <riv> so many specifics
[16:34:41] <Brekkjern> Of course. I just really wish I grokked it
[16:35:53] <riv> well it's just a matter of investing time - there is a really good free coursera course by dan boneh which shows relates all the common crypto gadgets back to basic block ciphers which I really got a lot from
[16:36:03] <riv> -shows
[16:36:38] <Brekkjern> Yeah, I just don't have time to invest in it, and I also kinda suck at math, so I have to overcome that too at the same time
[16:36:57] <riv> for the math, I skipped all the probability parts when I first did it
[16:37:25] <riv> so it's all just like bit sequences and functions that I could imagine implementing, so that makes it a bit easier going - but that definitely is part of what makes it hard
[16:37:56] <Brekkjern> I guess I'll see if I can't squeeze it in at the later end of the bachelor
[16:41:36] <epilys> it's okay to want to learn more about a subject but don't have such a big expectation from yourself, it's a bit unfair to compare with domain experts
[16:43:26] <Brekkjern> Of course. But whenever I read their posts I'm just a massive questionmark :P
[16:43:36] <Brekkjern> Even if I follow the links and google the things I don't understand
[16:43:36] <Xe> soatok is very high on the list of people i wish i could afford to contract for things
[16:44:23] <epilys> Brekkjern, nobody knows stuff a priori :p
[16:44:38] <epilys> ex nihilo* or whatever latin is appropriate
[16:44:44] <riv> also I think in general people don't realize how slow it is reading math (even experts)
[16:44:53] <riv> it just takes a lot more time
[16:45:06] <epilys> indeed
[16:45:12] <Brekkjern> epilys: Absolutely. I'm used to figuring out things myself. I've worked with computers for 10 years and programming for 5 years, and none of my knowledge has come from schooling.
[16:45:53] <Brekkjern> It's just that I see that soatak is writing stuff that is actually approachable as a junior to the topic, but I still don't understand it :P
[16:46:14] <Brekkjern> It just makes me see the enormous blind-spot I have for that part of the field
[16:47:08] <riv> well as i said there is a lot of specific details, but the basic of this post is that H(abc^def) = H(ab^cdef) (^ meaning join strings together)
[16:47:42] <riv> so you might trick a program by sending ab,cdef instead of abc,def
[16:49:16] <Brekkjern> I mean, it looks like there's a bit more to it than that though :P
[16:52:32] <Xe> i have a joke for you Brekkjern
[16:52:41] <Xe> it's thinking you need to understand everything
[17:06:21] <prussian> yeah the soatok posts are good. makes me dread doing real crypto work, at work.
[17:07:06] <riv> it's so easy to make mistakes
[17:07:10] <riv> but that's true with all programming
[17:08:15] <prussian> the problem is, I'm the anointed supposed security master with no one to really bounce ideas off of. that's more where the fear sets in.

[19:26:07] <gwozniak> Sometimes I think one of my coworkers really wants there to be a serious compiler problem so they can spend all their time on that and nothing else
[19:26:52] <dasm> isn't that obvious? if your code doesn't work, it's an issue with a compiler.
[19:27:37] <gwozniak> GCC's code may be a bit of a hairball, but I don't think there is a massive bug in one of its core passes just because it doesn't produce optimal code in this one case.  A more likely explanation is that the the target architecture code needs to be adjusted
[19:30:53] <gwozniak> I did find a bug in one of the passes, but it was only a bug because the target arch we are working on uses a very old mechanism to describe condition codes
[19:31:27] <gwozniak> We really should move to the new system, but I suspect it will be a serious effort and we don't have time for it at the moment
[19:32:52] <dasm> it's never a good time for that
[19:33:15] <gwozniak> After this release will be the time for it, I think, unless we push this release out
[19:35:17] <gwozniak> Of course, the possibility exists that there won't be another release after the current one
[19:36:21] <dasm> hah. the possibility is that there in next few (days, months, years) there could be end of a known world.
[19:36:29] <dasm> just sayin
[19:36:50] <gwozniak> Well, yes, there is always that :)
[19:37:40] <gwozniak> The weird thing is we have exactly one customer for the compiler we're working on, and they don't really need constant updates
[19:40:03] <gwozniak> So we're in a position where, if we get a compiler to them and it works as they need it, we may be able to set it aside and leave it
[19:42:16] <gwozniak> And the reason we're doing this in the first place is to provide a functional safety certified compiler (as per some ISO thing) that the customer really wants and that their current compiler does not, and will not, provide
[19:42:52] <dasm> nice.
[19:43:08] <dasm> yeah, if they're content with that, that's even better
[19:43:58] <gwozniak> I would like to switch to the new condition code system, but I doubt there will be time to do it.  Maybe there will be, if things change. Who knows.

[22:03:52] <gerikson> \i'd like to try to shoot a pistol
[22:04:01] <companion_cube> you can buy an AR-15 easily apparently
[22:04:22] <gerikson> we were going to in the military but then the Lahti got "skjutförbud"
[22:04:41] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Not sure about SBR specifically, but you can get semi-automatic ARs
[22:05:16] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: It's really not that difficult here either. Just takes a year of active participation at the shooting range
[22:05:33] <companion_cube> for an assault rifle? :o
[22:05:53] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: Well, a semi-auto version of an AR-15, yes
[22:06:27] <companion_cube> wow, TIL
[22:06:33] <Brekkjern> AFAIK, 30 rounders are legal here too
[22:06:35] <companion_cube> cause the fact it's semi-auto is pretty irrelevant
[22:06:39] <companion_cube> imho
[22:06:49] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:06:52] <Church> Been trying to find a .22 woodsman
[22:07:02] <Church> They're a bitch to find now a days
[22:07:10] <Brekkjern> Actually... I don't think there even is a capacity limit to the magazine here
[22:08:03] <Xe>  1 file changed, 69 insertions(+)
[22:09:04] <companion_cube> nice
[22:12:37] <Brekkjern> nice
[22:12:50] <hoistbypetard> is buttsbot broken? there's no reason a human needs to watch for 69 and say "nice" :)
[22:13:16] <Brekkjern> I was thinking the same. I thought it was supposed to react on every 69
[22:13:17] <buttsbot> nice
[22:13:19] <Brekkjern> There we go
[22:13:25] <Brekkjern> 420
[22:13:28] <Brekkjern> Meh
[22:13:34] <gerikson> not every 69 is good
[22:13:47] <Brekkjern> It reacts on every hlang though
[22:13:48] <Brekkjern> h
[22:13:48] <buttsbot> h
[22:13:55] <Brekkjern> I figured we'd want a compiler
[22:36:57] <Brekkjern> gerikson: I just found what seems to be the updated rules that are going to come into effect "soon" and as far as I understand the rifle has to be at least 84cm long in the shortest fireable configuration, and the barrel has to be at least 40cm. There's a bit of confusion about if that applies to just hunting rifles, or if the sports rifles are included.
[22:49:40] <prussian> sounds similar to America's definition.
[22:50:18] <Brekkjern> Probably, yeah
[22:50:44] <prussian> Canada punishes all with their uh... ~46cm barrels.
[22:52:26] <Brekkjern> There was a list of approved rifles before. The current interpretation of the new laws is that the list will be removed, so any rifle that fits a set of requirements will be allowed
[22:52:36] <prussian> well that's nice.
[22:52:48] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:52:49] <prussian> Connecticut has some funny list of no-no guns.
[22:52:53] <prussian> in America.
[22:53:32] <prussian> p annoying. Californians have weird no pistol grip crap and strange definitions of detachable magazines, or at least what is required to make them ok.
[22:53:43] <prussian> idk.
[22:53:47] <prussian> sad times.
[22:53:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:54:24] <Brekkjern> There's rumors that there will be a no-no list because politicians have said they want the Ruger Mini-14 banned
[22:54:30] <prussian> .....
[22:54:32] <prussian> why?
[22:54:42] <prussian> just.
[22:54:42] <Brekkjern> It was the weapon Anders Behring Breivik used at Utøya
[22:55:13] <prussian> might as well ban all intermediate cartridge, center fire rifles then...
[22:55:25] <prussian> anyhow.
[22:55:29] <prussian> oh right.
[22:55:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:56:10] <prussian> I use to have some pre-california-ban pistol grip Mini-14.
[22:56:13] <prussian> sold it though.
[22:56:27] <prussian> not great, not bad.
[22:57:11] <prussian> man I wonder how much it goes for in California now.
[22:57:18] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[22:57:19] <prussian> wonder if they banned transfers or some stupid shit.
[23:00:28] <prussian> well I'm done "working" today. Can't beat summer hours.
[23:01:09] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[23:01:18] <Brekkjern> I've done practically fuck-all for 2 weeks
[23:03:09] <prussian> same.
[23:03:19] <prussian> but my mid year performance review was "good?"
[23:03:29] <Xe> i just did a production instance resize
[23:03:32] <prussian> I guess I must become a leader. whatever that means.
[23:03:34] <Xe> i boxed 30 minutes for it
[23:03:38] <prussian> pray
[23:03:38] <prussian> ?
[23:03:41] <Xe> finished in exactly 15
[23:03:47] <prussian> nice.
[23:03:49] <Xe> 0 problems
[23:04:06] <prussian> I don't miss charging to projects at all
[23:04:44] <prussian> ok, I guess I'll add that as well. I'm not direct charge or have to worry about that.
[23:05:03] <prussian> nicety
[23:11:11] <gerikson> Brekkjern: they're gonna ban that specific model of gun, 10 years later?
[23:11:43] <Brekkjern> That's what they are saying, but the current drafts for the new law does not seem to be doing that

[23:18:55] <gerikson> tbh hi-cap repeater rifles are pretty unneeded for sports shooting
[23:19:03] <gerikson> outside military-themed sucd
[23:19:14] <gerikson> \i believe ABB had a weapons licensE?
[23:19:27] <Brekkjern> He had a hunting license and I believe a collectors license
[23:19:43] <gerikson> the guy who committed a bunch of racist killings in Malmö had a handgun license
[23:22:17] <Brekkjern> I honestly think there's even less of a good reason to have a handgun in a civilized society to be honest
[23:22:32] <gerikson> agreed
[23:22:58] <Brekkjern> It's not like my use case would be classified as "productive" in any way, but it would be fun
[23:23:08] <gerikson> well recreation is a thing ;)
[23:23:10] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:23:47] <gerikson> I think having quite strict license requirements is an ok start position for gun ownership
[23:23:53] <Brekkjern> Yep
[23:24:21] <gerikson> fwiw the Czech Republic seems to have very liberal gun laws and AFAIK is not that much of an outlier in gun violence
[23:24:39] <gerikson> but the wiki article is obviously slanted towards US audiences
[23:24:45] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[23:25:19] <gerikson> it's a bit like reading the article on "bimetallism", obviously infected by goldbugs

[23:35:57] <dasm> this ^
[23:36:07] <Brekkjern> >I’ve had issues like this before on arch and what I ended up doing is enabling tab to click and then just tapping with 2 fingers to right click instead of relying on the buttons. it actually works WAAAY better than the buttons most of the time anyways.
[23:36:07] <Brekkjern> That is better IMO :P
[23:36:27] <Brekkjern> "Your problem is invalid because I have a workaround."
[23:36:27] <Geekingfrog> I would still try windows :p
[23:36:32] <dasm> LOL
[23:36:43] <Brekkjern> It works in Ubuntu, so it's probably a driver issue
[23:36:50] <dasm> I'm amazed there is no "Did you try to turn it off and turn it on?" answer
