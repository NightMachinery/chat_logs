[05:10:32] <bugweiser> https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nanobsd&sektion=8&n=1
[05:11:01] *** Quits: amvc (~amvc@89.36.78.230) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:12:20] <asdflkj_sh> thanks!
[05:12:51] <bugweiser> for me puppy is to big (and it's a derivative if I understand correctly). Alpine is indeed what i'd like to 'graduate' to IF i can fully submit tinycore to my wil (aka it was to difficult to start with). Additionally, if I *can* submit TinyCore to my wil, then perhaps smart to stick to that, as the community should be having the same goals than mine ... And i'd not be in isolation basically doing my own distro.
[05:13:28] <bugweiser> I do *not* know how doable this nanobsd is.. I actually just discovered it today by accident..
[05:14:59] <asdflkj_sh> it's certainly interesting
[05:15:58] <bugweiser> currently for me a problem with tinycore is: all docs (well, that tiny amount there is) are geared to it's prime purpose: diskless ramdrive pxe/usb/opt_disc.  However, over the years all tools revolve around installing it... sigh... that makes it difficult for me (an you with this particular goal).
[05:17:03] <bugweiser> basicall it's cloud os, as default. But trying to getting it to work as advertized is hell. (couse most people don't get it, and having at least a userbase instead of you and me, made the tools centered around pesky installation).
[05:17:24] <asdflkj_sh> aye
[05:17:29] <bugweiser> yeah, the nanobsd seems to promise you can pull in everything freebsd has to offer.
[05:18:13] <asdflkj_sh> yes
[05:18:25] <asdflkj_sh> > If it is possible to do something
[05:18:26] <asdflkj_sh>         with FreeBSD, it is possible to do the same thing with NanoBSD,
[05:18:29] <asdflkj_sh>         unless the specific feature or features were explicitly removed
[05:18:31] <asdflkj_sh>         from the NanoBSD image when it was created.
[05:19:04] <asdflkj_sh> probably nanabsd's least insignificant issue for me is that freebsd isn't actually purely (fsf-endorsabley) free, and the other might be that it might be hard to get an initial image
[05:19:12] <bugweiser> the past 2 releases of tiny-core, you couldn't pull the usb plug.. 2 months of investigating on my part uncovered it didn't copy all 'packages' and mounted some straight of the boot-medium.. yeah, that is gonna give an unstable system once you pull the usb drive .
[05:19:28] <bugweiser> so.. I don't know how hardware support on bsd really is..
[05:19:39] <asdflkj_sh> yeah, that tinycore issue sucks
[05:20:14] <asdflkj_sh> bsd hardware support is probably fine for me, I don't need wifi or even GPU support
[05:20:56] <bugweiser> ahh, cool. I do need that for daily driver (well, gpu, couse youtube)
[05:21:13] <asdflkj_sh> yeah, that's the hardest part
[05:21:41] <bugweiser> wifi.. who uses that.. :) every room in my home has at least 2 wired lan outlets (including my toilet for shits 'n giggles)
[05:21:45] <asdflkj_sh> I quit my youtube account recently but I'd still want mpv, invidious, etc. to work
[05:22:15] <asdflkj_sh> yeah, ethernet is faster and less laggy anyway
[05:23:54] <asdflkj_sh> I'll probably ask #freebsd about nanobsd images as soon as I get my dumb sasl fixed
[05:24:17] <bugweiser> :)
[05:26:13] <bugweiser> the moment i heard someone was gonna do oldschool packet radio commercially (renamed to wifi) I knew.. a fun handfull of years for us nerds, untill 'everyone' uses it.

[05:47:43] <bugweiser> some opinions from the top results of my google bubble: https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/hardware-support-in-freebsd-is-not-so-bad-over-90-of-popular-hardware-is-supported.76466/
[05:48:16] <bugweiser> it states: The average support level for the most important device categories (Ethernet, WiFi, ATA/IDE/RAID, graphics card, and sound) is about 90% for FreeBSD, and this is the lower bound. The corresponding estimation for OpenBSD is 75%, and for NetBSD it is 60%. The weakest side of FreeBSD, as expected, was the WiFi-cards category, the share of compatible devices in which was just over 70%
[05:55:15] <asdflkj_sh> on OpenBSD AIUI all hardware is either supported extremely well or not at all, eg. the bluetooth stack was too mediocre for their taste so they just ripped the entire thing out
[05:55:44] <asdflkj_sh> SearX is libre and can return google results btw
[05:58:05] <bugweiser> mojeek and swisscows have own searchengine. I'll give searX a go.
[05:59:31] <asdflkj_sh> I switched to it for good after bing got caught censoring the tank man photos on the anniversary of tienanmen square recently, duckduckgo (which I had used for years before hand) was affected and I realized supporting ddg funds ms' unconscionable support of the genocidal cpc
[06:00:18] <pert> Besides the Linux kernel, OpenBSD is the only libre system that supports the ath9k_htc wireless devices for example, so I agree with your sentiment. Their wireless support seems better than FreeBSD's on the surface

[06:18:15] <bugweiser> asdflkj_sh.. I can't help but wonder.. do they know what it is they are removing (when deblobbing).
[06:19:20] <bugweiser> it somehow worries me when I read that it takes a day to update the 'deblobbing script' (with a 'tone' implying that is a lot, especially compared to the actual deblobbing of a sourcetree in like 3 mins).
[06:19:49] <bugweiser> (unfair to say what I said without quote ofcourse..) https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/The-Linux-libre-Project
[06:20:08] <bugweiser> s/quote/quote of source/
[06:21:42] <asdflkj_sh> the fact that they're blobs means they can't know how many malicious misfeatures are in them
[06:22:17] <asdflkj_sh> I imagine that quote means it takes a day to make sure they're not missing anything new and then get the script published publicly
[06:23:29] <asdflkj_sh> and maybe they might tune it for performance by making sure they're not removing the same thing twice (that might be what's meant by "Finally, I compare the changes introduced by deblobbing with those in the previous release, and make any further adjustments to the handling of files that were over – or under – deblobbed.
[06:23:33] <asdflkj_sh> "
[06:23:39] <asdflkj_sh> )

[07:12:07] <bugweiser> jxself, thanks. Not long ago I did some reading through their dev forums, and i got some sensation bsd wants to excel at what it's good at, arguably perhaps at the cost of some general purpose desktop needs (I recall a lot of 'slow' or 'high cpu' graphics issues which were said to be known). It's hard to tell for me as I kinda decided on tinycore for now (some 2 years ago) and as such didn't focus much on bsd. But granted, this nanobsd does appear 
[07:12:07] <bugweiser> to be very interesting for those interested in tinycore and alpine (run from ram, diskless)

[12:49:23] <bugweiser> Hi all. I'm in contact with the license steward of a company that wrote a rather popular software license text, a text which in turn lead to a bunch of popular (and fsf and osi approved) 'derivative works', ie other licenses. 
[12:50:00] <bugweiser> With the best of intentions and in the interest of the community, including the derived licences (and their userbase),

[12:50:55] <bugweiser> i am attempting to ask them to license their license text, as openly as possible, in such a way that it also legalises the other licenses (that were drafted from this 'original work').
[12:51:09] <bugweiser> the question:

[12:51:56] <bugweiser> what license or phrasing should/could I suggest to them. Please leave politics at the door in suggesting the best options !!

Additionally I offer to contact the popular 'choose a license' sites that already have a database field where the license to the license text can be stored and displayed.

[17:26:23] <bailsman> Does the GPL apply to neural network weights that are bundled with the binary program and required for it to function as intended? That is: must they be made available separately in a form that can be interpreted by the released source code - so that a user can create a modified version of the program that still functions - or as they exempt as "data"?
[17:29:57] <kilobug> bailsman: IANAL but I would consider them data

[17:33:07] <bailsman> So you could make your GPL licensed program depend, for its functioning, on a neural network, that you can license separately under a proprietary license, ensuring that no user can actually make a modified program that functions?
[17:33:19] *** Quits: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:34:18] <kilobug> bailsman: that would seem to me like a GPLed game engine with all the levels/maps/... under a proprietary license, which does exist
[17:35:56] <kilobug> bailsman: if that were to happen in real life and become an issue, you would likely see users creating and releasing under GPL (or a CC or any other appropriate free license) alternative dataset of neural network weights
[17:36:01] <bailsman> That does seem to be an analogous situation - you cannot play the game without all the assets / levels / maps - so I guess the answer is yes you can do that.
[17:36:59] <bailsman> The situation I'm thinking of is https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2021/our-lawsuit-against-chessbase/
[17:37:42] <scara> Hm, no one talking about audacity here?
[17:38:04] <bailsman> I was wondering if the derivative chess engine "Fat Fritz 2" - is in compliance with the GPL if they share their source code but not their weights
[17:38:26] <bailsman> The answer would seem to be yes, that's fine.
[17:39:33] <kilobug> bailsman: I would say yes, but again IANAL, there might be a fine distinction between the role of a game map/level and the weights of the neural network that a lawyer could argue about
[17:39:50] <jxself> The "answer" is a bunch of people speculating on IRC. If you want a real one, consult a copyright attorney. :)
[17:40:05] <kilobug> scara: I remember some discussion about it like 10 days ago, but I don't remember exactly
[17:40:28] <bailsman> And then, even an attorney can only speculate about what a judge would rule :/ But, speculation can be accurate.
[17:40:44] <kilobug> jxself: yeah, definitely don't trust my own guess/opinion, or do so at your own risk ;)
[17:41:02] <scara> Personaly I haven't read the entire gplv3 license since its too long but sounds like it is breaking freedom 0, idk though

[17:41:29] <jxself> I suspect a proper answer will involve the phrase "it depends" at some point... and is more detailed and is more finessed.
[17:41:35] <Noisytoot> are you talking about the audacity age restriction?
[17:42:30] <kilobug> my guess/opinion is made with good faith and by someone who did read the whole GPLv2 a few times and GPLv3 once, but I'm a software developer/sysadmin, not a lawyer, so I may very well be wrong
[17:42:45] <bailsman> I would say it certainly breaks the spirit of the license. I wonder if it depends on how your product is marketed. Perhaps a game engine functions fine - as a game engine - without all the levels/etc. But the chess engine doens't function as a chess engine without the weights.
[17:45:28] <jxself> It seems desirable for people to release them under GPL compatible terms so a good policy to adopt would be for people to do that. Create whatever backup argument are needed to support that position.
[17:46:39] <kilobug> are the weight fully fixed, or does the game still learn (ie, improve the weight) as it plays ?
[17:46:54] <bailsman> Yeah what good faith actors should do is clear - the question potentially arises in the context of throwing the book at people that have deliberately misrepresented their proprietary software as original work when it is fact the GPL engine stockfish with minor modifications.
[17:47:32] <bailsman> After being notified of their license violation, they've now released the source code, but not the weights, what I'm wondering if they can still have the book thrown at them or not.
[17:47:51] <bailsman> BTW I am not a party in the dispute, just a curious bystander.
[17:48:31] <kilobug> indeed, if people were all working with good faith and valued freedom, we wouldn't need copyleft... we need copyleft because there are rogue actors out there... 
[17:49:00] <bailsman> kilobug: So far as I know they've not released any code to train the weights, and the released source code cannot be compiled into a working product.
[17:49:21] <jxself> There's an argument that they're part of the program then.
[17:50:59] <jxself> The GPL has Corresponding Source as a defined term.
[17:51:00] <jxself> ***all*** the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) ***run*** the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
[17:51:04] <jxself> Emphasis added.
[17:52:07] <jxself> If you need those to do all of that then you've got a good argument, IMO, that they are in fact par of the defined term "Corresponding Source"
[17:52:57] <jxself> Arguing the overall policy position from a GPL compliance perspective can be helpful but you'd need an attorney to do that.
[17:53:10] <kilobug> jxself: hum yeah I guess you can argue they need to release either the weights or the program used to train them

[17:58:57] <bailsman> You could compile in the weights used by stockfish, and then the released source code would work. But then it would function as stockfish and not as the original binary program.

[18:06:16] <kompowiec> from year to year, I have the impression that the discussion about author's rights is more and more absurd.
[18:06:48] <kompowiec> and it all comes down to money.
[18:08:27] <bailsman> How interpretable is the GPL for a layperson? Is legal language full of 'false friends' so that you think you understand but you don't? Or can you be reasonably confident that if it is clear to you it will be clear to a judge in the same way?

[18:10:01] <kompowiec> GPL is probably one of the few legal documents written very clearly.
[18:10:51] <kompowiec> normally legal documents seek to be interpreted in many ways.
[18:11:50] <kilobug> GPLv2 is pretty easy to read/understand by a layperson, GPLv3 is more complicated (since it tries to close more loopholes) but was still understandable to me

[18:15:42] <bailsman> I wonder if the weights would be considered "installation information": any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
[18:15:45] <bailsman> with solely because modification has been made.
[18:18:19] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87)
[18:18:32] <bailsman> In any case this section does not apply to this situation because it is not a "User Product"
[18:18:42] <bailsman> but that's the kind of requirement I was thinking of to ensure the freedom to make modifications.
[18:18:54] <bailsman> I wonder why that requirement is limited to consumer products
[18:19:07] <jxself> It's addressing Tivoization.
[18:19:40] <jxself> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization
[18:20:34] <jxself> aka crypto lockdown. "Sure we'll give you the source code - but good luck running it on that device. Hahaha sucker!"
[18:21:55] <jxself> The Corresponding Source piece seems a better argument to make.
