[01:07:22] <somiaj> sonny: the text you are using should be defining what things mean.
[01:07:37] <somiaj> there is no single reference, because there are often slight variations, and you should use the definitions for the text/course you are in
[01:08:15] <sonny> ok

[01:12:41] <sonny> I was solving this question "Show that P(n) and P(2) imply P(2n)". P(n): x_1..x_n <= ((x_1+..+x_2)/n)^n, if x_1,..,x_n >= 0. The answer is if you write out P(2) and P(n) you will see that P(2) is contained in P(n), So P(n) is in P(2n). When I first read the question I just had no clue what that meant ... it sounded like logic
[01:13:18] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[01:13:18] <somiaj> It takes a lot of practice to learn to read notation.
[01:13:46] <somiaj> I would interpret that as "If P(n) and P(2) then P(2n)", so a direct proof would be assume that P(n) and P(2) are true, then prove that P(2n) is also true
[01:13:50] <sonny> but this isn't a notation problem?
[01:14:03] <somiaj> here P(...) is just some statement.
[01:14:25] <sonny> yeah, what I am supposed to think when I hear P(n) and P(2)?
[01:15:11] <sonny> P(...) isn't a fact
[01:15:13] <somiaj> So if x1*x2 <= (x1 + x2)/2 and x1*x2*....*xn <= (x1 + x2 + ... + xn)/2, then you need to use logic to show that x1*x2*...*x2n <= (x1 + x2 + ... + x2n)/(2n) -- oopps I left off a power
[01:15:20] <somiaj> It is a predicate
[01:15:27] <somiaj> A predicate is a collection of statements
[01:15:36] <somiaj> so each 'input' gives you a new statement
[01:16:16] <somiaj> but the statement 'show P(n) and P(2) imply P(2x)' is a new statement that is an 'if ... then ...' statement. And this statement is true provide that whenever the first statement is true, so is the second statment.
[01:16:30] <sonny> wait so, this is because it is a relation?
[01:16:35] <somiaj> No, it isn't a realtion
[01:16:44] <sonny> <=
[01:17:00] <somiaj> well this statement involves the standard <= relation, but P(n) is more than that
[01:17:45] <sonny> I don't know what to say ... if I didn't look at the answer I'd have no clue
[01:18:04] <somiaj> Actually I have a question about your notation, yous tate that P(n): x1*x2*...*xn <= ( (x1 + ... + x2)/n )^n -- why is there a ... between x1 and x2, should that be x1 + ... + xn?

[01:19:41] <somiaj> I assume this is some discrete math course? Often ones first introduction in to more proof based mathematics?
[01:19:51] <sonny> yeah, it's concrete mathematics
[01:20:36] <somiaj> My experience with students in these types of classes is it takes a lot of work to change your preception of math. Most think of math being more computational vs a collection of statements and logical proofs of those statements.
[01:21:12] <somiaj> So yes, a lot of these proofs seem obvious once you see them, because the point isn't to have some hard/crazy proof. The point is to help you start being able to come up with logical statements on your own.

[01:26:09] <Fangs> thanks
[01:26:15] <sonny> Knuth*
[01:26:41] <Fangs> oh its that book
[01:26:56] <somiaj> sonny: 'show P(n) and P(2) implies P(2n)' is just way to say prove this, they just used show.
[01:27:10] <sonny> oh
[01:28:11] <sonny> I'm still not used to that style, cause what makes P(2n) false ... P(n) being false?
[01:28:32] <sonny> why is P(2) true?
[01:28:58] <sonny> I'm overthinking it
[01:29:00] <somiaj> What makes P(2n) false is that x_1*x_2*...*x_2n > ( (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_2n)/(2n) )^(2n)
[01:29:11] <somiaj> P(2) is true because we are assuming it to be true
[01:29:28] <sonny> somiaj: I was thinking of the logic condition where implication is false
[01:29:39] <somiaj> "A implies B" or "If A then B" is only false if A is true and B is false.
[01:29:58] <somiaj> So the direct way to prove "A implies B" is to assume A is true, and show that B must also be true.
[01:30:22] <somiaj> So a direct way to prove "P(n) and P(2) implies P(2n)" is to assume that P(n) and P(2) are true, and show that P(2n) is also true.

[01:32:01] <somiaj> I like to use examples like this, 'If x = 5 then x^2 = 25' is a true statement. The reason it is true is that no matter what value you pick for x, you get a true statement

[01:32:48] <somiaj> This covers the T=>T, F=>F, and F=>F case, which I try to use to inspire why the truth table for => looks like it does
[01:33:15] <sonny> 4^2=25
[01:33:24] <somiaj> On the other hand 'If x^2 = 25 then x = 5' is a false statement, because (-5)^2 = 25 is true while -5 = 5 is false
[01:33:36] <somiaj> sonny: 4^2 = 25 is a false statement.

[01:36:07] <sonny> I was thinking of computing stuff

[02:28:00] <Z-module> Yes, it's two-term linear recurrence, so the first two terms are set arbitrarily by definition, both to 1. If you instead define the first two as 1, 3, you can the "Lucas sequence" instead.

[02:30:47] <kongsheng> bildramer, it may have been the proof relating to the laplace transform, they use 0- in the lower limit of the integral, sometimes -epsilon though.
[02:32:17] <Z-module> If you use only 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...   (so no repeats any more), then: As you can easily show by induction, every positive integer has a unique (up to order) expression as a sum of one or more distinct "non-adjacent" terms from that sequence. So:  1 = 1.  2 = 2.  3 = 3  (we don't allow 1 + 2, since 1 is adjacent to 2 in the sequence).  4 = 1 + 3.  5 = 5 (we don't allow 2 + 3).  6 = 1 + 5.  7 = 2 + 5.  8 = 8.  9 = 1 + 8.   Etc.  This is
[02:32:17] <Z-module> the "Zeckendorf representation" of natural numbers, but this isn't the fact I had in mind yet.

[03:14:54] <PlanckWalk> If b_{k+1} < F_{k+1} then b_{k+1} can be represented at least two ways (the Fibonacci way, and itself) and if b_{k+1} > F_{k+1} then F_{k+1} has no such representation.
[03:15:09] <PlanckWalk> So that leaves only b_{k+1} = F_{k+1}
[03:15:44] <z6np-6w> b{k+1} = phi * b{k}
[03:16:09] <z6np-6w> depending which way you're going

[09:38:29] <Batzy> well i mean we can't make sense of it
[09:38:34] <Batzy> we're not 4th dimensional beings
[09:38:57] <kj7rrv> Okay
[09:39:35] <kj7rrv> I guess a cube through time is a tesseract measured (assuming SI units) in seconds times cubic meters?
[09:39:53] <Batzy> yeah but that starts to lose meaning
[09:40:02] <Batzy> if the velocity is 0 then it's just the  cube
[09:40:10] <Batzy> if it has velocity, the measure increases
[09:40:19] <Batzy> we don't usually like relativistic spatial measurements
[09:40:47] <kj7rrv> Isn't it moving through time even if it is stationary in space?

[09:41:24] <kj7rrv> Probably
[09:41:38] <Batzy> yeah right, why wouldn't it
[09:41:49] <Batzy> you really need all dimensions to be spatial though i think

[09:42:31] <Batzy> well wait
[09:42:33] <Batzy> i guess they are?
[09:42:41] <kj7rrv> Oh okay, so I guess if you are keeping time in seconds, you have to measure the 3 "normal" spatial dimensions in light seconds?

[09:42:53] <kj7rrv> Yeah, 4D is confusing

[09:51:41] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: way to piss on everyone's parade
[09:52:34] <greenbagels> like imagine just a square, say [0,1] x [0,1], at a given snapshot in time
[09:52:42] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, in Minkowski space a cube that exists for a short period of time is a tesseract.
[09:52:53] <kj7rrv> I guess a video of a square is a cube?
[09:53:37] <ski> a square times an interval (of the same length as the square side length) is a cube
[09:53:53] <PlanckWalk> (But the isometries in that space are not just the Euclidean ones)
[09:54:24] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: in minkowski a cube moving wrt the manifold is a tesseract too, right?

[09:55:04] <kj7rrv> Is a video of a point a line?
[09:55:08] <PlanckWalk> So it's a bit more tricky to say exactly what you mean by "tesseract" when the isometries aren't the same as the ones in the usual spaces where we talk about tesseracts.
[09:55:09] <greenbagels> isnt it an image of a tesseract Batzy?
[09:55:18] <Batzy> kj7rrv: in the same sense sure
[09:55:26] <kj7rrv> Okay
[09:55:51] <greenbagels> my main concern here is whether kj7rrv is clear in their head about what they mean by "video of a point"
[09:56:15] <greenbagels> as in, precise about hte definition
[09:56:19] <kj7rrv> I mean "a point that exists for a fixed period of time"
[09:56:25] <mycroftiv> you could take the movie frames and align them in the third dimension and if the cinema frames were all transparent apart from the video content youd see the point-time-line
[09:56:32] <kj7rrv> The "video" just makes it easier to understand

[10:06:53] <Batzy> yeah but what's a signature saying?

[10:13:07] <kj7rrv> So basically, if you have a cube, and its height, width, and depth are all x, and it exists for the duration x/c, it is (was?) a tesseract?

[10:13:45] <Batzy> oh what does a signature of 1,1,1,1 "look like"
[10:13:48] <PlanckWalk> (And I mean that literally. Even the fact that observations are possible.)
[10:14:44] <PlanckWalk> Like, as soon as you have an idea that things obey differential equations of some sort, you get classification of spaces based on what metric structure they have.
[10:14:56] <Batzy> sure
[10:15:07] <PlanckWalk> 1,1,1,1 gives you spaces in which everything depends causally on everything else, everywhere in the universe and all time.

[14:35:13] <toulene> can i bother this channel for book recommendations?
[14:36:54] <blackk> sure
[14:37:00] <blackk> we might not know but ask ahead
[14:37:14] <toulene> i need recommendations for a book for group theory
[14:37:15] <blackk> Im pretty booked so maybe I could help
[14:37:23] <blackk> whats your background?
[14:37:47] <blackk> abstract algebra books do have a little group theory in it
[14:37:53] <blackk> but I do not know if you want much more than that
[14:37:59] <blackk> rotman has a book on group theory
[14:38:00] <toulene> yes, abstract algebra is good
[14:38:05] <blackk> well rotman
[14:38:18] <blackk> Im notsure if it is a good recommendation though
[14:38:22] <blackk> let me see my list
[14:38:37] <blackk> oh yes
[14:38:38] <toulene> i have no background in anything
[14:38:44] <blackk> he also has a book dedicated to roup theory
[14:38:53] <blackk> "An introduction to the theory of groups" by Rotman

[14:39:46] <toulene> no i wanted to do abstract algebra but was unsure how relevant it would have been to my required "group theory" target at school
[14:39:47] <blackk> maybe until chapter 4 which is 82 pages in total

[14:42:29] <blackk> to me "abstract algebra" is the american way of saying "some different little topics in algebra for undergraduates"
[14:43:00] <toulene> i like to call it structures, not sure how accurate of a name that is
[14:43:10] <toulene> if that is bad, correct me
[14:43:40] <blackk> well no one calls it this way.. but you can always say "a set has the structure of group by endowing it with an operation etc. etc."
[14:43:58] <blackk> some countries just call it "algebra"
[14:44:08] <blackk> but I guess "algebra" for americans means... highschool stuff
[14:44:17] <toulene> mathematicians really suck at naming their bodies of literature
[14:44:31] <blackk> but once they reach university it would mean "something more difficult than abstract algebra"
[14:44:40] <blackk> I tend to agree
[14:45:02] <blackk> we have something called "rings"
[14:45:25] <blackk> somethings are called "syzygies"
[14:45:40] <blackk> some other things are called "exotic spheres"

[20:11:22] <river> what have you tried?
[20:11:25] <cadmio> I started by calculating Z_2(a)
[20:11:55] <river> you should perform the long division f(x) / (x-a)

[21:12:12] <cadmio> *degree
[21:12:34] <Z-module> Every coset of (p(x)) has infinitely many different ways of being written as some  q(x) + (p(x))   but if you require deg(q(x)) < 3, then there's just a unique way.
[21:13:01] <Z-module> THis comes from the division algorithm in F[x], for any field F
[21:13:08] <Z-module> the "remainder" term is unique
[21:13:44] <cadmio> where does it come the requirement deg(q(x)) < 3?
[21:13:58] <wierzbowski> why 3?
[21:14:23] <cadmio> why can't it be greater than the degree of p(x) ?
[21:14:24] <Z-module> Isn't your p(x) specifically x^3 + ...  here, a poly of degree 3 ?
[21:15:44] <Z-module> you *can* use q(x) of degree 3 or more, but in all cases you end up with  q(x) = d(x)p(x) + r(x)   where deg(r(x)) < deg(p(x)) = 3  so r(x) must  be of the form  ax^2 + bx + c
[21:15:45] <cadmio> as I've understood the cosets of that field represent residue classes
[21:16:05] <cadmio> so a representative is the remainder of the division of a f(x) in Z_2[x] by p(x)
[21:16:13] *** Joins: econo (uid147250@user/econo)
[21:16:33] <Z-module> so since  q(x) = d(x)p(x) + r(x)   and d(x)p(x) is already in the ideal I = (p(x)), then  q(x) + I = r(x) + I
[21:16:51] <Z-module> so we are choosing a nice "canonical" representative of this coset, the one with degree < 3

[22:17:18] <int-e> Batzy: what Z-module was saying was that if a polynomial of degree 3 has no roots (in the base ring) then it's irreducible. (x-1)^3 has roots in Z_2 and that makes it reducible.

[22:38:19] <isekaijin> In the directed case, the brute-force method is this. Let X_n = {1,..,n}^2 minus the diagonal. Identify a graph on n vertices with a function X_n -> bool. It's easy to to enumerate all such functions. For each function f : X_n -> bool, check if the graph is isomorphic to a previously visited one. If not, yield.
[22:38:26] <isekaijin> But this is horribly inefficient, of course.

[23:15:16] <Kora9> int-e: I'm not talking about numerology or attaching any significance to it. I wanted to figure out the sane/logical reason it was easy to get to the number 68 through addition there
[23:15:27] <int-e> there isn't
[23:16:07] <Kora9> I think we already found that there is, in that you arbitrarily find a way to add the first two sets to get the same number, and then wait for a third event that adds up in the same fashion and claim "voila"
[23:16:47] <river> > I'm not talking about numerology
[23:16:52] <river> this is numerology
[23:17:35] <Kora9> No. It literally is not.
[23:17:43] <river> it is
[23:18:12] <Kora9> Numerology requires believing that there is a significance to the outcome per definition. What I'm doing is the opposite, deconstructing it without belief

[23:18:31] <river> ok but
[23:18:40] <river> it's numerology whether you believe if not
[23:18:50] <river>  i suppose this will continue in #not-math now
[23:19:35] <int-e> good choice
