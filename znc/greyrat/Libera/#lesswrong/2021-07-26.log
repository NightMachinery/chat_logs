[00:04:03] <catern> dbohdan: oh yes! I love that, too! great page!
[00:04:10] <dbohdan> Thanks!
[00:04:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: lol @ the "fermentation" guy
[00:05:26] <catern> dbohdan: one that might be suitable is Creatures, e.g. https://gamefabrique.com/storage/screenshots/pc/creatures-2-04.png
[00:05:27] <Robomot> image/png (307x172; 1.3 MB)
[00:08:04] <dbohdan> catern: I should add it
[00:08:25] <catern> also most Synthetic Reality games, e.g. Warpath https://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/w/warpath-nat/warpath_4.png (although hm, not as much as I remembered, so maybe not)

[00:09:27] <catern> oh, and certainly progress quest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Quest#/media/File:ProgressQuest_Screenshot.png
[00:09:28] <Robomot> Progress Quest - Wikipedia (Progress Quest is a video game developed by Eric Fredricksen as a parody of EverQuest and other massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is loosely considered a zero-player game, in the sense that once the player has set up their artificial character, there is no user interaction at all; the game "plays" itself, with the human player as spectator. …)
[00:09:36] <catern> although that one is kind of intentionally a parody
[00:09:41] <dbohdan> catern: I really wish this was still a thing.  Alas, it isn't even really possible, because graphical operating systems have lost consistency and deemphasized native widgets.  Windows in particular is a mess.  The best platform to make a new game in this style is probably still Windows 95.
[00:11:21] <dbohdan> catern: Oh yes, I thought about adding _ProgressQuest_
[00:14:49] <catern> (you already included several of the ones I was thinking of - SimTower and the Incredible Machine)
[00:15:14] <catern> (and Civilization, although I know its UI from Freeciv)

[00:17:50] <dbohdan> I think the reason I didn't add _Creatures_ was that I couldn't find a high-quality screenshot with the window borders present

[00:22:46] <Robomot> HackermonDev - Freenom, the free domains website, is a scam. (I recently found out that the entire service is basically a scam and you don't own any of the domains you get.)
[00:23:31] <feep> if you aren't the customer..
[00:24:28] <catern> it's almost inspiring me to start up my own scams, where else could one deploy this model? buying cheap things and giving them away for free and then holding it hostage once people become dependent...

[00:29:01] <catern> (even if the patent application is accepted)
[00:29:15] <catern> all of those ones, you're typing in information which is useful immediately on its own
[00:29:30] <catern> vuln checker is good though I guess heh
[00:29:57] <gwern> 'free trademark checker'
[00:30:04] <catern> free cdn! that would be a good one
[00:30:22] <gwern> to inject ads once it becomes popular?
[00:30:37] <catern> yes, or just take it away unless you start paying, same as this domain service
[00:30:50] <Fusxfaranto> think you've been beaten to that one
[00:31:07] <gwern> well, the problem there is that if they control the *domain*, then taking away the cdn isn't much of a threat. they'll just switch to CF. they're hostage only as far as the switching cost there
[00:31:20] <catern> gwern: hm, true true
[00:31:27] <gwern> I'd suggest something like aws lambda with its free tiers

[00:34:34] <gwern> then do 'license inspections' a la oracle

[00:37:02] <nshepperd> student licences seem basically designed for this -- they're free while you're busy learning and getting hooked on it, then when you start trying to make a living...
[00:37:45] <gwern> I think the criminality/exploitation is a critical part of this. otherwise, it's just regular old price discrimination/market segmentation of various kinds, which is everywhere
[00:38:55] <catern> yeah I think the core is that you think it's 100% free, but they'll actually take it away spontaneously if you start doing something sufficiently valuable with it

[16:29:52] <PapuaHardyNet> and the passages in the book are so beautiful
[16:30:24] <PapuaHardyNet> the author describes mundane things like Achilles throwing a fig to Patroclus and they both eating it in such a sensual way, its is an absolute feast of the senses to read it

[18:50:44] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: not as good as the spider story, and I thought that genetic engineering terrorism story about male pregnancies was better reproductive horror, but the punchline helps redeem it. I wonder how many people realize that sheldon implies that the women are mind-altered by the alien chemicals? it seems pretty easy to miss if you don't know what 'lordosis' refers to
[18:52:08] <PapuaHardyNet> which stories are we talking about here?
[18:52:44] <PapuaHardyNet> or is that a reference to the original Illiad? Because I'm not very well versed in the classics
[18:52:47] <gwern> https://web.archive.org/web/20080702231205/http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/sheldon/sheldon1.html
[18:52:48] <Robomot> THE SCREWFLY SOLUTION-PAGE 1
[18:52:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[18:55:51] *** Joins: kanzure (~kanzure@user/kanzure)
[18:57:55] * gwern looks at reviews of it. yeah, apparently pretty much everyone does miss it. dumb. sheldon is better than you think
[19:04:50] <nshepperd2> i don't get it
[19:04:53] <gwern> basically, sheldon implies in one passage that the chemical deranges both male and female mating instincts; the male mating instinct is a controlled violence, so misdirected, it results in delivering violence rather than sex/reproduction, killing the woman; it offhandedly mentions that the female instinct is 'lordosis', which if you have read as much about cats as I have, you instantly know...
[19:04:59] <gwern> ...is the passive mounting/rearing instinct https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis_behavior , so the parallel is the women *accept* violence rather than sex/reproduction, and the woman is killed.
[19:05:00] <Robomot> Lordosis behavior - Wikipedia (Lordosis behavior, also known as mammalian lordosis (Greek lordōsis, from lordos "bent backward"[1]) or presenting, is the naturally occurring body posture for sexual receptivity to copulation present in most mammals including rodents, elephants, and cats. …)
[19:05:53] <gwern> this is why throughout the story, every woman is bizarrely, bafflingly, utterly, completely passive, inactive, lacking any self-preservation behavior or fighting back, almost literally from the start where the female epidemiologist lays down on the cot to be butchered, to the end where our protagonist decides to just stand there and wait for the hunters to come and kill her
[19:06:59] <gwern> this is why there's so much emphasis on the relative early on dithering and saying she should sell her house, on the refugees not fighting back, and so on and so forth
[19:07:06] <nshepperd2> oh
[19:07:30] <gwern> sheldon consistently parallels men being aggressive and gradually trending to killing, with women being passive and waiting around to kill
[19:07:38] <nshepperd2> i googled 'lordosis' and was like 'what? spinal curvature?'
[19:08:19] <gwern> like the spider story that makes more sense if you are a bit familiar with weirder spider reproduction, I think this is another case where sheldon's readers are unworthy of her
[19:09:09] <gwern> they simplify it down to something they understand. the story hammers in that the males are deranged by the chemical - that must be all there is to it! lordosis, what's that, must just be jargon. and why are the women so helpless? it's not like it's a feminist writing it or anything
[19:09:53] <gwern> 'it must be *exactly* like the screwfly strategy! true, it doesn't involve men masturbating onto womens' heads, but uh... we'll just ignore that"
[19:10:11] <gwern> 'close enough, makes sense. case closed, next story pls'
[19:10:19] <PapuaHardyNet> whoa, the MC is into his underage daughter
[19:10:43] <gwern> well, she's pretty hot. unfortunaely for her, this is a story literally about how sex=death
[19:10:47] <PapuaHardyNet> I thought I knew this author from asstr, and perhaps I did once encounter his works on asstr
[19:11:40] <feep[work]> I mean, that still kind of doesn't make sense though
[19:12:02] <feep[work]> looking at that paragraph, like, I see what the story is going for?
[19:12:39] <feep[work]> but ... like, applying this concept to the female wouldn't generate a person who's receptive to violence
[19:12:44] <feep[work]> because that's not a foreplay stage for females
[19:13:00] <feep[work]> ..... that I know?
[19:13:26] <gwern> you think women aren't into a bit of being roughed up or subtle violence or being a sub
[19:13:48] <feep[work]> I mean, obviously yes, but I don't think that's a ... ...... ooh
[19:13:50] <kuudes> well that may already be the illness speaking
[19:13:55] <kuudes> but yeah, a good story imo
[19:14:08] <gwern> (and in-universe, as a matter of worldbuilding, it makes perfect sense. if women fought back or fled, well, they're half of humanity. heck, they could like kidnap men and forcibly impregnant using them (don't need a lot of men). if you make them passive and lambs baring their necks for the slaughter, it can be over and done with in a year. real estate agents know that time is money)
[19:15:15] <feep[work]> I mean, it makes logical sense, I'm just not convinced it makes biological sense with the explanation as presented
[19:15:19] <kuudes> I figured the same cause that made men to do what they did, sort of made women do what they did as well
[19:15:31] <kuudes> also, the story is from decades ago
[19:15:46] <gwern> this strikes me as being like "Story of Your Life". the simplified crude version is what you get from a lazy read, even though it requires you to believe a lot of nonsense worldbuilding and just completely ignore the technical terminology that the smart, knowledgeable author very deliberately inserted
[19:15:52] <feep[work]> anyway, you could make it work under a theory where like ... female passivity and responsiveness to violence is part of the mechanism trying to induce that violence/lust transition
[19:16:18] <feep[work]> but ... I don't know if that's actually a real thing, even though it'd explain a lot about typical female kinks
[19:16:27] <kuudes> well, world at that time was more violent than world of today
[19:16:35] <gwern> well yes, lordosis instinct is very important. it's actually critical to reproduction, if you break it, mice don't reproduce. so you can have brainless mice reproducing but if the mounting or lordosis breaks, then they become sterile
[19:16:44] <kuudes> like, these days we don't have very much workplace violence anymore etc
[19:17:03] <feep[work]> gwern: I'm not saying lordosis isn't relevant, I'm saying the way in which the virus affects lordosis has to be a *different mechanism* than how it affects men.
[19:17:43] <gwern> I think as she presents it, she's thinking of a single agent which deranges the mechanism from sex into violence, and that's just how it works in each half of the passive/active pair
[19:17:55] <feep[work]> that's not how it's written though
[19:18:11] <feep[work]> as it's written, the theory is that violence to sex is a natural transition
[19:18:14] <nshepperd2> if you read too closely it doesn't quite work. it describes the virus/whatever as inhibiting a transition from aggressive to copulatory behaviour in men
[19:18:14] <feep[work]> which the virus inhibits.
[19:18:15] <gwern> cf the spider story about eating and being eaten being instinctive
[19:19:01] <feep[work]> but like, there isn't such a thing as a "lordisis is passivity to violence" mechanism
[19:19:04] <nshepperd2> whereas there isn't really a transition from accepting violence to not-accepting violence in women whose inhibition would explain it
[19:19:13] * gwern was reading about decerebrated mice and cats for /Hydrocephalus
[19:19:49] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: right, you *can* make it work under a specific theory of female kink that I don't know if it's actually true
[19:20:04] <feep[work]> where female arousal from violence is part of the violence-to-sex *trigger mechanism* in men
[19:20:16] <feep[work]> and if you can just amplify and pin that reaction, it sort of works out
[19:20:49] <feep[work]> ie. the female is sort of in a persistent presenting state waiting for a sex switch that never comes
[19:21:14] <feep[work]> but I think saying "something something lordosis" may be rightfully considered a bit short to select that theory. :p
[19:22:46] <feep[work]> (but wow, if that theory was true, it would say some VERY uncomfortable things about battered wifes...)
[19:27:05] <kuudes> well that is one theory
[19:27:50] <kuudes> for me the point that the story brought salient was how nice it is we live in society where most males are not that very animialistically aggressive :)
[19:28:02] <feep[work]> yeah
[19:29:15] <gwern> that's definitely one reason people are very uncomfortable discussing the popularity of rape and other violent scenarios among women
[19:29:40] <gwern> we don't want to think about what it says about dark triad traits or bad boys or the causes thereof
[19:30:30] <feep[work]> I mean, I don't think it has any moral implications if dark triad traits are genetically selected for
[19:31:03] <feep[work]> human rights are an adaptation, not a fitness maximizing strategy
[19:31:25] <feep[work]> conversely, the actually fitness maximizing thing can end up arbitrarily horrible.
[19:31:29] <PapuaHardyNet> god yes, the ending was good!
[19:31:39] <nshepperd2> people are too stupid to realize when things don't have moral implications
[19:31:45] <feep[work]> that's fair.
[19:34:20] <nshepperd2> (a lot of politics is actually just people repeating the just world fallacy at each other angrily)
[19:34:32] <vorpalhex> the meta-fallacy fallacy
[19:37:07] <nshepperd2> anyway it sure is nice that human mating doesn't involve devouring each other's heads then laying eggs in the corpse
[19:37:59] *** Joins: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm)
[19:38:26] <nshepperd2> really dodged a bullet there
[19:39:01] <feep[work]> human mating involves creating a parasite that literally hacks the female body in an all-out war for resources
[19:39:04] <catern> the story made me uncomfortable but I guess it was good
[19:39:29] <nshepperd2> feep[work]: true
[19:39:30] <catern> I felt like there had to be more going on than just messing with the reproductive instinct though - like some messing with time preference
[19:39:37] <feep[work]> not to mention that the birthing process is reminiscent of an (even more) uncomfortably sexual alien from aliens
[19:39:44] <feep[work]> c**tburster
[19:39:53] <feep[work]> and often kills the mother
[19:39:55] <nshepperd2> lol
[19:40:05] <catern> otherwise, okay, society would get totally changed, but men would still be able to plan for the future, and reproduce with their enslaved women (before killing them)
[19:40:08] <PapuaHardyNet> that's an actual alien? didn't you mean chestbuster?
[19:40:16] <feep[work]> every reproductive ritual is freaky.
[19:40:28] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: no like ... babies don't burst from the chest, that's sort of the point
[19:40:29] <nshepperd2> there's also the thing where having children brainwashes you i guess
[19:40:39] <feep[work]> alien was made to be weirdly sexual, birth is like alien but *actually even more* sexual
[19:40:45] <feep[work]> like, overtly, offensively sexual
[19:40:49] <PapuaHardyNet> oh. my aliens lore is rather weak
[19:41:11] <nshepperd2> try leveling up your human lore instead
[19:41:25] <feep[work]> oh and yeah, having a child literally rewrites your brain to prioritize it
[19:41:34] <feep[work]> which is good because raising a kid is years of psychic torture
[19:41:35] <catern> gwern: thanks for your lordosis explanation btw, that enhanced the story a lot
[19:41:46] <catern> I didn't get that
[19:42:21] <catern> I didn't know who the author was, though, so I just assumed it was some kind of ridiculously misogynistic stuff
[19:44:57] <catern> (and didn't bother reading more deeply until your explanation)
[19:45:59] <gwern> alas. indeed like 'story of your life'
[19:46:29] <gwern> if you don't have high expectations, you write it off as "ridiculously {misognyistic, techbabble} stuff, no need to read any deeper"
[19:47:40] <feep[work]> uh? what's the deeper angle of story of your life?
[19:47:55] <gwern> it's psychology, not time travel
[19:48:13] <catern> (indeed, I was prepped with high expectations for "story of your life", so it's quite astonishing to me to hear that people read it as time travel)
[19:48:15] <feep[work]> mm. I guess
[19:48:15] <gwern> a different qualia of experiencing planning/action/optimization. very friston
[19:49:58] <catern> the misogyny interpretation might be deliberate by sheldon though
[19:50:21] <catern> because the second paragraph certainly seems misogynistic...
[19:51:00] <gwern> that would undermine the point about the religion being nonsensical and madeup as merely a mechanism for the chemical
[19:51:03] <catern> (unless that's his wife already being affected by the alien manipulation? hm...)
[19:52:39] <gwern> quite possibly. she's just writing to him, as opposed to taking any kind of real action, and everyone (women included) is already surprisingly sanguine about these religious cultists murdering women
[19:52:45] <gwern> we're in media res, after all
[19:52:50] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[19:53:01] <catern> oh, that's true
[19:53:09] <gwern> (if you remember the 1970s, people were *not* sanguine about religious cultists murdering women)
[19:53:25] <catern> she starts off by talking about her jealousy of other women, then moves to talking about mass murder of women around the world...
[19:53:26] <feep[work]> OH, yeah okay I see why they made story of your life about time travel
[19:53:37] <feep[work]> it's ... it *is* time travel, but of a way that would be utterly impossible to visualize.
[19:53:45] <gwern> oh yeah, for the movie. god, it's hard enough to explain even to physics-types on paper
[19:54:07] <gwern> as evidenced by how badly everyone misunderstands the story too
[19:54:09] <feep[work]> I have a pdf of it open, like. I don't think the time travel interpretation is, per se, wrong.
[19:54:30] <feep[work]> people model time travel from a sequential perspective. I think the best way to understand the mechanism of time travel may be reading egan's Orthogonal.
[19:54:49] <feep[work]> which has physical, not cognitive, time travel/time coherence, but of a model that ... like
[19:54:58] <feep[work]> egan models causal time loops as a kind of standing quantum wave
[19:55:12] <feep[work]> the entire configuration in space-time exists at once, as a single object
[19:55:45] <feep[work]> it's not a matter of how do you make a time loop happen, or what makes time loops coherent, it's just that .... like, shapes that exist are by definition coherent.
[19:55:58] <feep[work]> it's a circle, if it weren't closing it wouldn't be a circle.
[19:55:59] <gwern> the block universe minimizes various properties, yes
[19:56:02] <nshepperd2> well, everyone understands time travel. but reading about lagrangian mechanics (even in the form of a live action movie) can't make you experience a different qualia of the passage of time
[19:56:03] <feep[work]> right exactly
[19:56:15] <rsaarelm> So wait did I read Story of Your Life and read it as the protagonist getting some kind of precognition from working too long on the alien language and then was aware of future stuff but couldn't affect it because the same viewpoint whammy forces you to let time go as it does.
[19:56:30] <feep[work]> so I think reading orthogonal kind of helps understand how ... like, heptapod b makes that coherence occur through purely psychological or strategic means.
[19:56:45] <rsaarelm> I don't think I figured out a deeper idea from it and was confused about so hey does se actually have precognition which is impossible or what.
[19:57:24] <gwern> rsaarelm: she doesn't get any actual precognition. she just gets a psychology in which she experiences the world as if she had precognition, as she increasingly better understands over time what everything 'was always going to' turn out to be
[19:57:37] <feep[work]> right, and like, you know how planning is time travel?
[19:57:39] <rsaarelm> Right, that makes more sense.
[19:58:11] <gwern> at every instant, her mind replans and recomputes history to imagine how it would look from outside the block-universe
[19:58:19] <rsaarelm> I did start thinking about it now and went "hey isn't she narrating the story now after the stuff she talks about having been able to predict but not act on..."
[19:58:28] <feep[work]> right, the entire plan and its realization is one cognitive object that is indistinguishable from action.
[19:58:38] <gwern> she still has to actually think normally in terms of forward-mode cause and effect to plan, but she understands it backwards-mode
[19:59:33] <nshepperd2> see i can understand all the words in that sentence but it doesn't mean anything
[20:00:27] <feep[work]> humans visualize a goal state, and then simulate a sequence of actions that will attain this state
[20:00:45] <feep[work]> when this process is too long, we engage in sequential replanning, decomposition, etc.
[20:00:47] <nshepperd2> i think for it to mean anything i'd have to actually experience a different qualia of the passage of time irl
[20:01:16] <feep[work]> but the thing that we experience is ... like, "I am at position X." the location along the plan is primary; the plan itself is a cognitive artifact.
[20:01:49] <gwern> I think it's a failure by chiang for that reason. try as he might, he can't make you *see* that way just by verbal arguments and descriptions
[20:01:54] <feep[work]> yeah
[20:02:02] <gwern> a noble failure, but a failure nevertheless
[20:02:22] <feep[work]> and I think that's why I'm more accepting of the physical time travel view of the heptapod power
[20:02:58] <feep[work]> it's about as well as you can do without literally rewiring your viewers.
[20:03:30] <gwern> it's better as a story but worth less as art. no one needs another basic time-travel-which-can-change-the-future thing
[20:03:41] <feep[work]> true.
[20:03:48] <feep[work]> but eh.
[20:07:40] <feep[work]> I think the idea is ... like. 
[20:08:31] <feep[work]> humans do exploratory cognition. we step from world state to world state via causal, active links. so do heptapods, but I think they conceive of the ... state of actions on the timeline in a more global fashion. (they probably didn't have many predators.)
[20:08:54] <feep[work]> I mean, like, the human cognition works the way it does cause we need to replan quickly in a dynamic environment, right?
[20:09:34] <feep[work]> if the heptapods grew up slowly and eusocially in a predictable environment, they may tend to prefer a mode of cognition that offered more overview over the entire shape in time
[20:10:06] <feep[work]> less "exploring a graph" and more "assembling legos"
[20:10:29] <gwern> well. the heptapod view is closest to, I think, gradient-based planning, which is model-based. however, model-free RL is a big part of how all things lower than humans, and humans, learn and 'plan' implicitly and act
[20:10:32] <feep[work]> parts of human language and cognition kind of resemble that model, consider "once the idea was out there"
[20:12:21] <feep[work]> I wonder what heptapod combat looks like.

[21:08:38] <gwern> as for actual sales, well, I imagine most of these marginal sales are sales of used books. that may help future authors indirectly but won't help past ones
[21:09:06] <gwern> the more important part here is the sales imply large deadweight losses: copyright was blocking the creation of mere snippet search pre-GB
[21:09:36] <gwern> if you can get these effects simply from *working search*, people still having to track down and actually buy the darn things, then full downloadable books would be even more used

I knew the author form the spider story (an old favorite), knew what lordosis behavior was, finished the story, actually thought about the lordosis bit for a moment, switched to IRC, and bam.  Now I am a little ashamed of myself for not making the connection.  (Which I think is there!)
[21:15:04] <gwern> imo, if it's not there, we should all quietly ignore any evidence from sheldon like a letter where she explains it (the author is literally dead), and pretend that my interpretation is the right interpretation because it's so much creepier :)

[21:15:20] <dbohdan> Yes

[21:58:06] <feep> xor
[21:58:32] <ggreer> feep: syntax error. make them use parens to specify which happens first
[21:58:34] <ggreer> :P
[21:58:43] <nshepperd2> basically they meant to say "evaluate the jacobian of softmax(·/τ) at θ+Gk" but got confused in the writing of the paper and ended up writing the opposite
[21:58:53] <feep> ggreer: eeh, yes but not in 0.1
[21:58:58] <ggreer> heh
[21:59:07] <ggreer> then I'd do whatever's easiest to code
[21:59:13] <feep> they're equally easy
[21:59:59] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C++#Operator_precedence C puts & above ^
[21:59:59] <nshepperd2> do whichever is most confusing so you'll be forced to remember to make it a syntax error later
[22:00:00] <gwern> I think I'd make ^ higher. in the same way that I'd expect it if I wrote '10^40 > 0 && 10^-40 < 0'
[22:00:00] <Robomot> Operators in C and C++ - Wikipedia [Operator precedence] (This is a list of operators in the C and C++ programming languages. All the operators listed exist in C++; the column "Included in C", states whether an operator is also present in C. Note that C does not support operator overloading. …)
[22:00:15] <dbohdan> I second ggreer recommendation.  Complex operator precedence is of the devil.
[22:00:22] <feep> gwern: ^ xor, not exponent
[22:00:35] <dbohdan> Otherwise, & > ^ > |

[22:00:42] <feep> dbohdan: alright, going with that yeah
[22:00:43] <gwern> yes, but I'd expect it to be similar, because it uses similar notation
[22:00:48] <dbohdan> This is how it is in Tcl's expression DSL and in C
[22:01:07] <feep> gwern: right, but I'm targeting C people over math people

[22:01:38] <feep> dbohdan: yeah, but also no
[22:01:41] <feep> because um.
[22:01:50] <nshepperd2> just implement whatever you need to make syntax errors first lol
[22:01:55] <feep> there's ... I can't remember if I told you this anecdote
[22:02:24] <feep> like, you know that in javascript, it does this thing where
[22:02:37] <feep> if (a & 3 == 3), this does (a & (3 == 3))
[22:03:03] <feep> and I looked up the complete chain of inheritance for that once
[22:03:18] <feep> javascript does it because C does it, and C does it because BCPL does it, and I think it goes back like that until
[22:03:31] <feep> there's a predecessor language, I don't remember if it was B or BCPL, where there aren't any short-circuiting boolean operators
[22:03:39] <feep> so & and | take the role that && and || do today
[22:04:05] <feep> and that's why & and | are almost at the same level as && and ||, because of a language shortcoming that has been fixed for over thirty years.
[22:04:10] <feep> welcome to fucking software.
[22:04:13] <dbohdan> Makes sense
[22:04:36] <feep> anyway, I refuse to copy that specific part of the precedence table. in my languages, & binds higher than ==.
[22:04:58] <nshepperd2> (*first* parse sequences of infix operators into a list, *then* separately apply operator precedence to reassociate the list into a tree. then it's easy to validate comparability of operators in an expression)
[22:05:17] <feep> nshepperd2: yeah I know that parse logic, I have to admit I kludged it XD

[22:52:01] <feepbot> <gwern> 'This has been the big surprise of my Substack experience, the frequency with which I both gain and lose subscribers. In fact, my expectations were completely subverted. My assumption was that projected annual income would grow slowly but that those who bothered to get out their credit cards would really commit for the long term. In fact the opposite has been true. At the
[22:52:01] <feepbot> beginning I set what I thought was a somewhat ambitious goal for subscription revenue at the end of the first year. Instead I hit that goal in the first six weeks. But I also found that people will unsubscribe quite readily, again probably less because of specific unpopular posts and more because of a string of posts that just don’t spark their interest. And this leads to my
[22:52:01] <feepbot> secondary surprise: I care about that. After 15 years of proud indifference to clicks and shares and all manner of external validation for my writing, I find that I want to have more readers rather than fewer and to make more money rather than less. I try to police myself and to remain as idiosyncratic and driven by whim as ever, but I cannot help but notice my own concern for
[22:52:06] <feepbot> paying down my student loans6. Perhaps the people with really high crowdfunded revenues are free from this sort of feeling because of that cash buffer. But I’m not. There is no such thing as independent media; there’s just different kinds of dependence. If you’re taking people’s money you’re under their influence, period.'

[23:13:10] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: mm? we get diverse outputs already?
[23:13:32] <gwern> it'd probably be faster than starting with fully noised samples
