[02:43:21] <DOMF> I think I did
[02:43:41] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> Different architectures, different use cases
[02:43:43] <CableNinja> also openresty has lua built in

[02:44:22] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> but apache's resiliancy comes at resource cost
[02:44:34] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> nginx's single worker per core vs apache's process/thread per connection
[02:45:25] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> Apache is far more flexible and powerful in terms of functionality/configuration, nginx will make your php app scream though
[02:46:06] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> Apache you can do per-directory permissions configurations, nginx is a far different configuration/permissions model
[02:46:13] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> instead of a user doing .htaccess, you have to do it in the main config
[02:46:17] <sd> 06<Aâ€‹da> i dont think 99% of use cases need that flexibility, i think it just comes down to what youre gonna design your setup around
[02:46:29] <signofzeta> Apache supports .htaccess files, but NGINX makes you stick every little thing in one file.
[02:46:37] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> if i'm going to have a server with users maintaining their own web stuff, then apache is the way i'm going, hands down
[02:46:45] <signofzeta> Plus, if you want to serve one file with different headers, it replaces its parent's headers.
[02:46:51] <signofzeta> But that being said, I use NGINX for almost everything.
[02:47:11] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> again, neither is clearly better than the other, but they all excel in different areas

[17:18:51] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> It happens because of the angle the sun is hitting the earth at at that time. It essentially scatters the spectrum of light - which is ROYGBIV (rainbow). The sky is typically blue because the atmosphere scatter all the IV lights and then scatters B mostly. At that angle, it goes through more of our atmosphere. So it scatters GBIV and leaves ROY.

[18:55:20] <xe0n> sorry can you say that again, JollyRgrs? my hat is blocking out my wifi
[18:55:24] <csws> dude PublicWiFi if you get a google pixel it's a good deal $$$ wise and you can just flash it
[18:55:25] <PublicWiFi> its for privacy midned folk who want a simple smartphone
[18:55:28] <csws> just make sure you don't get a verizon branded one
[18:55:40] <PublicWiFi> yeah i've heard they are easy to flash
[18:55:47] <csws> super mega easy
[18:55:48] <xe0n> JUST WAIT FOR GOOGLE SILICON (TM)
[18:55:48] <PublicWiFi> but I really like the idea of a physical switch on the mic and camera lol
[18:55:58] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: I SAID! I NEED TO BUY STOCK IN TIN FOIL COMPANIES!
[18:56:05] <csws> you still gotta trust the switch is implemented properly!
[18:56:07] <sd> 06<Aâ€‹da> xiaomi are good buys also if youre gonna flash
[18:56:19] <oxipital> ah the old indian manager
[18:56:20] <csws> also what if they do the trick where speaker coils are used as a line in to act as a mic?
[18:56:22] <oxipital> he prefers gui
[18:56:23] <vinrock> xiaomi makes some cool shit
[18:56:26] <oxipital> you prefer powershell
[18:56:26] <csws> since it vibrates in the same way
[18:56:26] <xe0n> AH I GOT HALF OF THAT SENTE TH PACK TS DRO PED
[18:56:28] <sd> 02<râ€‹yalln> the switch needs to be physically disconeting the mic and camera

[18:56:51] <JollyRgrs> I have a binary thing and right now I have a Y axis of every .2 from 0 to 1
[18:56:53] <oxipital> so he decides to test your powershell "how would you get a snapshot of hyperv vm in powershell"
[18:56:53] <vinrock> jolly i did when i used icinga2
[18:56:55] <oxipital> uh
[18:56:58] <vinrock> i switched to zabbix tho
[18:57:00] <oxipital> it's one fucking command
[18:57:02] <PublicWiFi> csws: hmm if its not powered the signal would be terribly weak
[18:57:07] <PublicWiFi> no idea how that would work
[18:57:13] <JollyRgrs> i don't want 0.2 and 0.4 and 0.6... I just want "on" or "off" on the Y axis
[18:57:14] <oxipital> so get-vmsnapshot $vmname
[18:57:26] <PublicWiFi> csws: thats it, im gonna toss my phone in the trash ;P

[21:34:19] <oxipital> medical science has determined that we should tolerate more pain than we do

[21:36:18] <int0x1C8> she has fibromyalgia, so she gets 60 hydrocodone every month, but never takes more than half a pill for the day if she needs it at all, so she always has a bunch extra
[21:36:24] <oxipital> get a big ole 30 xanax a month
[21:36:28] <oxipital> and 14 clonazepam
[21:36:51] <oxipital> but all the tramadol i want 
[21:38:06] <int0x1C8> she gives me like 30 every few months for emergency stash purposes, but I ran through it because the goddamn doctors won't give me shit except "take tylenol"
[21:38:14] <oxipital> yeah
[21:38:52] <int0x1C8> even when I explain that the pain is at a 10 by the time I try to go to sleep at night, like deep DEEP bone pain
[21:38:59] <oxipital> same
[21:39:08] <oxipital> i get random stabs in my feet and legs
[21:39:14] <fritzwastaken> @takumi so that is a legit request with the AP right?
[21:39:19] <oxipital> and thats the best way i can describe it, stabs

[21:42:59] <oxipital> metoprolol and lasix
[21:43:07] <oxipital> i usually rock a 100/40
[21:43:09] <int0x1C8> I'm just about to the point of telling my doctor I'd rather deal with the risk of stroke than the pain
[21:43:20] <oxipital> and come off dialysis at like 80/50
[21:43:28] <oxipital> low blood pressure is fucking awesome
[21:43:31] <int0x1C8> they put me on carvedilol and lisinopril
[21:43:42] <oxipital> yeah i was on lisinopril
[21:43:49] <oxipital> have them try minoxidil
[21:43:51] <oxipital> no lie
[21:44:14] <oxipital> when i first started on dialysis my bp would spike to like 230/185
[21:44:23] <oxipital> doctors were like "uhh"
[21:44:33] <oxipital> i guess they thought about it
[21:44:38] <int0x1C8> my blood pressure jumps around, when I'm home and relaxed it's usually 120-130/80-90
[21:44:41] <oxipital> but recommended minoxidil
[21:44:58] <int0x1C8> when I was in the hospital it was constantly like 175/125
[21:45:07] <oxipital> why are you on anything?
[21:45:12] <oxipital> those arent bad bps.
[21:45:16] <catbeard> anyone else set up 401k with a Roth?
[21:45:44] <shakygator> nope just IRA
[21:45:54] <oxipital> i think i had one at one time
[21:46:08] <catbeard> ok well i'm thinking of going with a Roth
[21:46:21] <oxipital> it's a blanlket for the 401k
[21:46:26] <shakygator> roth 401k or roth ira (idk the difference)
[21:46:27] <int0x1C8> if I take my BP at home when I'm not relaxed the highest I've measured was 160/120, and average over all is pretty much 145/90
[21:46:30] <catbeard> but the options to sign up for 401k (through my employer's vendor) are a little confusing
[21:46:34] <oxipital> insulates income in there from taxes
[21:46:35] <catbeard> roth IRA
[21:46:49] <oxipital> int0x1C8: that's not high bp;
[21:47:01] <shakygator> max your 401k up to emp contrib, if they match. then max out roth IRA
[21:47:15] <catbeard> Your employer will match your contribution as follows:
[21:47:16] <int0x1C8> but they want me on meds because while I was in the hospital post-op my diastolic rarely dropped below 115
[21:47:16] <catbeard>     + 100% on the first 3% of your salary
[21:47:18] <catbeard>     + 50% on the next 2% of your salary
[21:47:20] <catbeard> The matching contribution will not exceed 4% of your salary.
[21:47:23] <shakygator> im not actively contributing to my roth cuz ACH reasons
[21:47:25] <oxipital> https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/ira-vs-401k-retirement-accounts
[21:47:35] <shakygator> okay so do 5%
[21:47:46] <int0x1C8> even though I was recovering from open abdominal surgery and I have hella white coat syndrome
[21:47:51] <shakygator> mine does similar shit but reverse from yours. i have to contrib 6% to get 3% from them
[21:47:53] <oxipital> int0x1C8:well yeah, you just got cut on
[21:47:58] <oxipital> man, stop taking them
[21:48:01] <catbeard> shakygator: that's not an option at least for pre-tax, minimum is 8%
[21:48:03] <oxipital> see if that helps
[21:48:08] <oxipital> if you feel ok
[21:48:08] <int0x1C8> I did
[21:48:13] <oxipital> tell your doctor to fuck off.

[21:48:40] <shakygator> dumb
[21:48:43] <oxipital> i've had plans with a minimum of like 5%
[21:48:52] <shakygator> i dont like when they have arbitrary rules, you should be able to contrib what you want
[21:48:54] <shakygator> when you want
[21:48:56] <oxipital> well they can't really make any money if they dont do that
[21:49:42] <oxipital> my problem is when the employer mandates a shitty plan
[21:49:47] <oxipital> and you can't go elsewhere.
