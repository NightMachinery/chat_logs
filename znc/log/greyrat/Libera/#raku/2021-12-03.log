[00:07:06] <tonyo> Ergo444: stuff only gets fixed if bugs get reported
[00:08:46] <Ergo444> read this conversation.... https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/141#issuecomment-983696562
[00:09:23] <tonyo> what's that to do with fez?
[00:12:28] <Ergo444> nothing, but it has to do with that bugs I am not always fixed
[00:12:34] <Ergo444> even if they are reported
[00:13:01] <tonyo> not reporting guarantees it won't get fixed.  meta.list is eventually going away
[00:15:35] <tonyo> Ergo444: are you jaffa4?
[00:15:44] <Ergo444> same
[00:17:04] <tonyo> put it on meta.list then
[00:17:16] <Ergo444> I have already done so.

[15:45:00] <tbrowder> well, on the remote, upgrade would NOT work, but specifying the version suceeded
[15:46:20] <tbrowder> think something is messed up with zef db there...
[15:52:18] <tbrowder> i think with the first no upgrade i should have run plain "zef upgrade" to see if updating pkg indices would have helped. anyway, i just uninstalled mi6, then requested it be installed and got latest version, so no apparent foul.
[15:53:46] <tbrowder> lizmat: silently looks cool. would it solve the testing problem you think instead
[15:55:09] <tbrowder> **when testing "shell cmd" and trying to capture its output?
[15:56:19] <lizmat> silently just overrides $*OUT and $*ERR for the scope of the block given

[18:53:34] <patrickb> At the core I need to call a raku function from C. I a clean way to do that is to set up a callback function via nativecall in raku land and then use that callback on the C side.
[18:53:48] <patrickb> *I think that
[18:55:31] <patrickb> Now apache being apache has each request in it's own thread. Is there any documentation on the limits wrt treads and nativecall callbacks? Can I just concurrently hit the same callback from different threads?

[19:12:27] <Altai-man> in general it's because unless you specify the type it won't check what's inside the array and then the subroutine doesn't want to "risk" and accept something potentially bogus
[19:12:57] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> well the type was Array
[19:13:58] <Altai-man> you mean like "sub foo(Array @foo) {}"?
[19:14:08] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> yes
[19:14:51] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[19:15:25] <Altai-man> "@" sigil implies @rray by itself (or rather anything doing Positional role), so "typing" the variable with this sigil specifies type of elements inside the Positional. So "Int @rray" is a positional of Ints and "Array @rray" is a positional of Arrays.
[19:16:08] <Altai-man> so you can either drop the type if you don't want it, "@" will imply something positional for you, or do "Array $foo" if you want it for some reason.

[19:19:35] <Altai-man> yup, same case. if you don't want a type guarantee, then remove the type declaration, otherwise ensure types on the caller side.

[20:11:30] <xenu> i looked at the code of some random modules and none are using those extensions
[20:12:08] <xenu> .t also conflicts with perl, but it seems it *is* commonly used so it probably has to stay

[23:40:53] <patrickb> yes
[23:41:19] <tonyo> another banger
