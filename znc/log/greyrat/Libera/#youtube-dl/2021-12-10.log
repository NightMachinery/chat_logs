[16:43:43] <ede> now that's funny, it was in #yt-dlp
[16:45:07] <ede> also it seems gnoo is a yt-dlp trojan horse
[16:45:38] <gnoo> lol, well a man needs his videos... for science!
[16:46:53] <ede> oh, so not even a bot
[16:46:59] <ede> gnoo, are you ashish?
[16:47:04] <gnoo> JustLandedOnMars: or you can patch it as suggested here: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30271
[16:47:14] <gnoo> ede: no
[16:47:34] <gnoo> ahh, you mean Ashish0804 xD
[16:47:39] *** Joins: asdflkj_sh (asdflkj@bsdforall.org)
[16:48:00] <ede> it's ashaming that such a person is even accepted in a FOSS project
[16:48:38] <ede> FOSS is about software and not about narrow-minded moralism
[16:49:13] <ede> neverthless i've seen some links in that thread which looked interesting
[16:49:14] <gnoo> well, anyone can do whatever is the very motto of free software
[16:50:02] <ede> if you accept toxic people in your team then it falls back to your projects
[16:50:07] <gnoo> idk if he contributed to yt-dl or not, but his views shouldn't matter much
[16:50:37] <ede> so being a toxic racist is fine?
[16:50:57] <gnoo> yeah, now that's where moderation comes in. mods reminding that issues should be about different ways to solve issues and not their political discussion place
[16:51:03] <ede> also, he's spamming THIS project with his crap
[16:51:33] <gnoo> yup, hence the moderation part
[16:53:58] <ede> no idea how this works on GH, all i know is dstfw hasn't been seen for maybe half a year now
[16:54:10] <ede> (and i still can't remember that nick meh)
[16:56:58] <gnoo> oh, so i just saw ashish's other comments. it's hilarious. probably a troll
[16:59:32] <ede> look into yt-dlp's CO..something file (not CONTRIBUTORS as mentioned in the other channel). he's one of 3 asides from the project owner
[16:59:44] <ede> so if he's a troll then the project probably too
[17:03:06] <gnoo> oh
[17:07:58] <ede> this https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/Collaborators.md
[17:08:07] <ede> ofc firefox crashed right at that moment
[17:14:18] <ede> "I'm a python developer and machine learning student" and his comment to the TO stating " I am 64 years old and unfortunately I don't know English well and I don't know GitHub" and "I am crippled in a wheelchair, can't see well, can barely read from the big screen at 200dpi" is to call him a coomer.
[17:16:14] <gnoo> i haven't heard of any better alternatives to yt-dlp. and as long as it works and does it's job, idc what ashish has to say. the day it stops working on porn sites, i'd have to use something else
[17:16:38] <ede> lol
[17:17:01] <ede> it's just that such people shouldn't get a public platform
[17:17:25] <ede> he posted a reddit link in his forst comment there, so maybe he should stay there
[17:17:33] <gnoo> i mean, i'll not go back to viewing them in browsers as long as i can. mpv all the way
[17:18:03] <ede> definitely. to see mpv+youtube-dl was love at first sight.
[17:18:40] <ede> not even a need to dl the video first (youtube etc) or have a script feeding a live signal into mplayer
[17:19:54] <gnoo> yup, and since that's the only way i view youtube, the throttling was immediately noticeable
[17:20:15] <gnoo> although i don't like how yt-dlp writes it's man pages
[17:20:38] <gnoo> the first page is unreadable at best
[17:24:17] <ede> i wouldn't even mind using it, at least if i could believe them that they're paying the contributors fairly. only, it's google, so...
[17:24:52] <ede> it was possible somehow with their old Web UI, the new one simply made it unusable here.
[17:25:11] <ede> even with noscript only allowing what's really needed.
[17:25:58] <ede> yeah, starting with [IMAGE, looks like some poorly translated markdown or TeX or sth
[17:26:32] <gnoo> gh flavoured markdown. it's just the readme poorly converted
[17:27:27] <ede> ah, gh. they really should use a better source for all the target formats, *including* gh
[17:28:28] <ede> but i still wouldn't know what. i've looked at a lot of markdown and wiki already, some of them have really nice features, but whichever i choose as source for pandoc, something is always missing somehow :(
[17:29:56] <ede> i remember to have seen on both SE and GH discussions about features to be implemented, one at least was about tables. also image links i think. versatile beasts.
