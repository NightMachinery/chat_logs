[00:48:10] <fr34x[m]> do you guys compile your own kernel? does it have advantages?
[00:48:11] <Voxel> Of course in Linux most of custom features are required to be configured manually.
[00:48:22] <Voxel> Udev is nearly absolutely capable to mount general fs types.
[00:48:32] <Voxel> I mean, not mount, but initiate a command to mount it.
[00:49:05] <rendar> ok, let put this way: i'm installing Debian netinst into a server, what i have to configure/install without installing Xorg, to have usb keys automounted?

[02:41:57] <Dagmar> So long as you make the OS aware it's dealing with an SSD and it should use TRIM, swap isn't a huge issue

[02:42:09] <Dagmar> ...because it'll issue TRIM commands when freeing swap.
[02:42:29] <bruda> I've never owned an SSD. Before they were too expensive, now they seem like they don't offer as much space as I'd prefer for the money I'm willing to spend.

[02:46:39] <bruda> GPT can work, but you still need to create a fat32 partition for /boot/efi in order to boot a uefi system. I usually do boot flag too. But a label isn't necessary.
[02:46:48] <Gaboradon> I guess GPT needs EFI partition but as you said doesn't enforce to be booted with UEFI mode, the other one is the MSR that I obviously don't need here, I'll just continue with the guide and see if it works
[02:47:01] <Dagmar> No, UEFI needs an EFI partition.
[02:47:15] <Dagmar> GPT is a partitioning method.  It doesn't "need" any specific filesystem whatsoever
[02:47:19] <Dagmar> Partitions _contain_ filesystems.
[02:48:04] <Gaboradon> Right, sorry if I didn't said that right, UEFI needs an EFI parition yes, but GPT Disk won't refuse to boot if it's booted with Legacy BIOS and Legacy bios just won't care about EFI parition and bood anyway ... right?

[03:12:25] <Kadigan> In most cases there's no need to store or log anything, so I would very much expect so. If you're extra-worried, there are distributions that unpack into RAM from a packed filesystem, which exists as a read-only file.

Then they imploded and LineageOS came out, and they won't go commercial because of what happened, and that was stupid.  Since they won't go commercial we'll never really have broad support on lots of top end devices without a TON of work from a private party.

[03:51:39] <randombit> NyB, if your problem is with a closed source binary for accessing the camera, rather than the whole system on top of it which is controlled and built by an entity gathering data from billions of people using the exact same system. then i dont see any point for a discussion here, also it wasnt my question originally.
[03:51:42] <hassoon> Sauvin: yep
[03:51:50] <THE_GFR|WORK> rustytaco: indeed and you can't get that on most phones or any really without a lot of work from a private dev to port over drivers and binaries etc
[03:52:06] <THE_GFR|WORK> rustytaco: basically you would need a $70/hour programmer to do it

[05:47:58] <Kadigan> I have no clue, honestly. But someone on SO raised it as a potential issue (I think due to how the data relies on being in the same positions, but SSDs doing their own thing as opposed to HDDs??), so I'm asking.

[05:49:51] <Kadigan> Right now I have two options: keep the whole thing as-is (2x HDD in MD with separate partitions), or move the OS to a new MD (I'm aiming for high availability here, though it's all consumer-grade hardware...) so that I can safely nuke it should I need to and not lose the data that's on the other MD. I mean, it's not every day you reinstall Linux, so the problem has a low incidence... but when it *does* come, it's a pain.

[07:23:36] <Dagmar> Dangit comcast
[07:23:39] <Sauvin> up_running, the real contention behind an answer like "incorrect" is that it implies a monochrome way of looking the world, the contrasts between two polar extremes without even a continuum of intervening grey. This is anathema to intellectual pursuit.

[07:24:29] <Dagmar> up_running: *Thinking* you know the answer is more dangerous than plain ignorance
[07:24:39] <Sauvin> Fire their eyes and find somebody how actually understands the teaching process.
[07:25:07] <up_running> I'll just say it then. The answer (according to the book) is D.
[07:25:23] <Dagmar> That's nice
[07:25:25] <up_running> I thought it was C.
[07:25:36] <Dagmar> THAT is why you check a man page at the first whiff that you might not be sure
[07:25:47] <up_running> The man page reads, `Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get.`
[07:25:48] <Dagmar> Eventually you'll be able to rememebr what the man page _looks like_
[07:26:04] <Sauvin> And one of the very first things I do when doing a re-install is making sure I have all the man pages (screw you, Debian!)
[07:26:06] <up_running> so, that seems to line up with what the question is asking
[07:26:22] <Dagmar> Also, checking a man page on a regular basis is one good way of finding out when the functionality of some tool you use has changed or gotten new features
[07:26:24] <up_running> I don't understand how the author states D is correct.
[07:26:40] <Sauvin> Actually, up_running, read the text of the *question* again.
[07:26:45] <Dagmar> Because curl, by default, spews the resource to STDOUT

[07:50:54] <rascul> yes
[07:50:57] <up_running> was that referring to C?

[07:51:38] <up_running> What does "Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get." mean then?
[07:51:49] <up_running> Isn't a local file stored locally?
[07:51:54] <Dagmar> They are.
[07:51:57] <rascul> "The  remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else"
[07:52:03] <Dagmar> They do however, require specific names

[07:52:35] <up_running> I understand that part but I thought the latter statement was independent of the former.

If I have an eventfd with EFD_SEMAPHORE set then I get that a write to the efd will set the counter and then all of the reads will decrement the counter by one until it is 0. What I don't get is what happens if there is a write in the middle of processes decrementing the read?

[11:43:08] <manwhowouldbekin> Greetings all. It appears that an update broke my LAN connection on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. It has happened within the past 1.5 months or so. The connection initiates, but is unable to ping anything. In the tray it shows up as active. I have tried what I could (cable, router, basic connection settings), but do not know how to troubleshoot it further. Any tips or help is appreciated.

[15:06:29] <iLinux-OS-User> Distro upgrades are too dangerous in production and mission critical machines...
[15:06:51] <TomyWork> totally agree
[15:06:52] <iLinux-OS-User> At least that's my experience...
[15:07:01] <jim> well that's why you keep backups :)

[15:25:44] <TomyWork> unix sockets if you want to pass data around. if you need to truly share it, the concept you're looking for is called "shared memory"
[15:25:48] *** Joins: jean (~jean@user/jean)
[15:26:25] <maxzor_> TomyWork, yes, if I understood correctly, the POSIX shared memory API, superseding the sysv one, is destined to intra-CPU communication; while the DMABUF API is destined to inter die (CPU not necessarily involved) communication. But they are pretty similar in concept otherwise.

[16:49:37] <ananke> pagios: and sure, you can do self signed certs on individual systems then front them with a forwarder that has your main cert. haproxy, traefik, etc could potentially do it. though you never said what kind of 'servers' those were, so I have no clue what protocols are involved
[16:49:50] <Blondie101010> updating a cert on the load balancer should be a 5 minute job at most
[16:50:29] <Blondie101010> bridging cert does involve knowing your load balancer's advanced configs

[16:54:37] <ananke> Blondie101010: there is nothing advanced about bridging HTTPS, and there is no 'bridging cert'. you simply serve incoming connections with whatever the main cert is, and you configure connections to internal systems using https/whatever

[17:58:04] <paulcarroty> so if you have a board with sata2 you can use pci-to-nvme adapter to get better speed

[17:59:14] <SineDeviance> but yeah, on a board with PCI-E you could theoretically get faster SATA speeds with a dedicated SATA controller

[17:59:31] <paulcarroty> so yeah, it's sata2
[17:59:38] <theos> its a very limited board. but, even 3Gb/s is much better than the slow hdd I was using before. even usb 2.0 was faster than that.
[17:59:41] <SineDeviance> might even be SATA 1

[20:20:31] <mlu> catbeard: mines' don't, and they don't have swap either :P
[20:20:51] <catbeard> peetaur: wot in tarnation
[20:21:03] <tessio> swap == disk reference, which the kernel PRACTICALLY reference on shortage of physical ram

[20:21:27] <mlu> I imagine swap can be useful for cases where you prefer an app to slow to a crawl than just crash out in out-of-memory scenarios
[20:21:42] <mlu> but the type of apps I run, I would prefer out-of-memory crashouts to swap slowdowns

[20:22:39] <mlu> (and in practice, while the system spins up a replacement instance too)
[20:22:46] <tessio> back then memory was very expensive ... and the use of swap (disk as memory) was inevitable that's all the story and today that's not the case

[22:17:34] <acidtonic_> currybullen, to true cryptographers, it's weak. Known plaintext attacks such as you likely have an /etc/hosts file with known headers, means it's trivial to adjust the tweak for the block until it decrypts with some effort. You'd need to avoid encrypting the known plaintext locations with the same key. Keep a unique volume just for user data, encrypt system separately

[22:30:52] <hexnewbie> Itaru: It's configurable. Having too small a /tmp can play tricks, e.g. optimizing a 20 GB mariadb table which it uses /tmp for may not fit in RAM. Also, ‘findmnt -T /tmp’ will tell the actual filesystem

[22:31:27] <znf> Depends on what you mean by "bad"
[22:31:47] <hexnewbie> Don't recall if MariaDB uses the system /tmp, or something in /var, but either way, a lot of stuff puts humongous files in temporary directories - mysql/mariadb, mc...
