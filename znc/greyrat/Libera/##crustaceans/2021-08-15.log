[00:46:04] <manicennui> I think one of my former physicians was responsible for one of the first HIV units at a hospital in the US.
[00:47:04] <manicennui> I knew that he was involved a lot of LBGTQ services while he was my physician, and eventually left to do it full time, but I didn't realize what he had done before.

They were known as ‚Äúthe gay presence‚Äù at Illinois Masonic, putting a human face on AIDS, offering comforting reassurance to frightened patients at a difficult time, and even
[00:48:33] <manicennui> making house calls.
[00:49:00] <manicennui> I even worked with another physician at my last employer (healthcare) who knew him.

[01:03:49] <buttsbot> Possibly weird question, but how would alligator be classified to a pescatarian? Would y'all count that within seafood or nah? It's somethin...
[01:12:17] <manicennui> It is a weird question, and the responses are useless.
[01:12:35] <manicennui> Do these people really base their diet on biological classification?
[01:12:50] <manicennui> The way I see it, you eat that way for one of two reason: health or ethics.
[01:12:54] <manicennui> Or some combination of the two.
[01:13:37] <manicennui> So the only question is whether eating alligators serves those reasons.

[06:15:42] <manicennui> It is.
[06:15:58] <manicennui> Reptiles and amphibians.
[06:16:36] <manicennui> So Evangelion 3.0 + 1.01 is even more baffling than the other movies.
[06:16:46] <manicennui> I enjoyed 1 and 2 a lot.
[06:17:27] <manicennui> I don't regret watching the last two, but I didn't understand most of what went on.
[06:17:28] <companion_cube> Sounds like patch versions
[06:17:36] <companion_cube> Evangelion 7.1 oreo
[06:17:52] <manicennui> Also, the creators are horndogs.
[06:19:59] <companion_cube> Japanese nerds? Hmm hmm
[06:20:49] <manicennui> I'm kind of curious whether anyone really understand Evangelion.
[06:20:57] <manicennui> The entire thing turns into a fever dream.

[06:23:13] <buttsbot> Alex Jones explains Evangelion to Joe Rogan - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X9RUOEOoNQ
[06:23:13] <manicennui> hahaha
[06:25:22] <manicennui> It almost seems plausible at first that he is actually explaining Evangelion.
[06:33:45] <manicennui> I think I'll watch 1.11 and 2.22 again at some point.
[06:33:51] <manicennui> I was pretty blown away by those two.
[06:36:52] <cb> companion_cube: japanese sequel naming schemes are nonsense
[06:36:56] <cb> wait until you see kingdom hearts
[06:38:34] <manicennui> Still not as bad as Nvidia's chip names.
[07:17:30] <drakonis> nah
[07:17:43] <drakonis> japan has a complicated relationship with naming schemes and names in general
[07:58:11] <indigo> Same with GPU naming schemes
[08:05:16] <drakonis> nvidia's chip names are based off important science figures
[08:10:54] <quanticle> manicennui: Don't worry about not understanding what went on in the last two
[08:10:58] <quanticle> They were not great movies
[08:11:48] <manicennui> drakonis: I was referring to the numbers and being unable to know whether a 1060 is more powerful than a 970, etc.
[08:12:01] <drakonis> but it is lol
[08:12:12] <quanticle> It is cery lol
[08:12:13] <drakonis> rule of thumb, the next generation is faster
[08:12:15] <quanticle> *very
[08:12:39] <manicennui> drakonis: Pretty sure some of the top end 900 series are better than the low end 1000s.
[08:12:47] <drakonis> nah
[08:13:01] <manicennui> But then you also have the 400 different configurations that each card maker sells.
[08:13:51] <drakonis> the 1060 is better than the 970 mind you
[08:14:06] <manicennui> https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-980-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050/2576vs3650
[08:14:06] <drakonis> it isnt faster than the 980 but it is better specced for other things
[08:14:13] <drakonis> that's a 1050
[08:14:23] <drakonis> https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-980-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1060-6GB/2576vs3639
[08:14:25] <buttsbot> UserBenchmark: Nvidia GTX 1060-6GB vs 980
[08:14:32] <manicennui> I wasn't making a specific claim about the 1060 and 970.
[08:14:37] <manicennui> I was just throwing model numbers out
[08:14:41] <manicennui> You are kind of making my point.
[08:14:42] <drakonis> please don't.
[08:14:47] <quanticle> manicennui: That Alex Jones/Joe Rogan video is basically episode 21 of the TV show lol
[08:15:10] <quanticle> That episode is an infodump where they try to explain exactly WTF is actually going on
[08:15:18] <quanticle> But it turns out that it just confuses you further
[08:15:58] <quanticle> The 400 different configurations... of GPU cards? No? You must be thinking of CPUs.
[08:16:09] <manicennui> Yes, of GPUs.
[08:16:13] <drakonis> cpus don't have that many configurations these days either
[08:16:18] <drakonis> those days have been over for some time now
[08:16:33] <drakonis> laptop specs have been largely consistent recently
[08:16:40] <quanticle> No, you're wrong. Each GPU has... like 4 versions. Low, medium, high, and more-money-than-sense
[08:16:43] <drakonis> so you don't have three dozen cpu variants
[08:17:18] <manicennui> quanticle: No.
[08:17:24] <manicennui> There is like the XC, SC, etc.
[08:17:27] <manicennui> There are about a dozen usually.
[08:17:30] <drakonis> both amd and nvidia deals in these configurations but only nvidia has the more money than sense option that doesnt make a difference
[08:17:34] <drakonis> that's uhhh
[08:17:35] <manicennui> In addition to the 1050, 1060, etc.
[08:17:41] <quanticle> Yeah, you're wrong?
[08:17:42] <drakonis> that's not official stuff
[08:17:51] <manicennui> I didn't say it was official stuff.
[08:17:55] <quanticle> What are you talking about with this XC, SC, whatever?
[08:17:56] <manicennui> Pull your head out of your ass for a moment.
[08:18:03] <manicennui> Buying a graphics card is a fucking joke these days.
[08:18:11] <quanticle> It is, but not for that reason
[08:18:13] <manicennui> In addition to the availability, it is impossible to know wtf to buy.
[08:18:17] <drakonis> those are the graphics cards manufacturers that do it
[08:18:21] <quanticle> No, it's pretty easy, actually.
[08:18:22] <drakonis> its typically related to cooling i guess?
[08:19:32] <quanticle> You just buy the card that corresponds to the sorts of games that you'll be playing and the screen resolution that you'll be playing them at. If you play at 1080p, even low-end cards will give you decent performance. If you're playing at 2560x1440p, 4k or at high refresh rates, then you'll want to go higher end.
[08:19:35] <manicennui> There end up being about 2-3 dozen combinations for each generation, and they aren't all faster than the previous generation.
[08:19:47] <drakonis> now that's where you're wrong
[08:19:53] <manicennui> I'm not though.
[08:19:56] <drakonis> there's usually 4 to 6 cards per generation, tops.
[08:20:25] <manicennui> I have literally seen the page where you could choose between a dozen variations of one chip for one generation.
[08:21:01] <quanticle> That just isn't true. For the current generation, for example, you have the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX 3060, etc. And while each member of the current generation is not necessarily faster than *all* members of the previous generation, each member of the current generation is faster than the *corresponding* member of the previous generation. A RTX 3080 is faster than a RTX 2080, for example.
[08:21:12] <drakonis> that's because there's a lot of manufacturers avilable per vendor
[08:21:39] <manicennui> https://www.newegg.com/msi-geforce-gtx-1050-ti-gtx-1050-ti-gaming-x-4g/p/N82E16814137054
[08:21:40] <buttsbot> MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti DirectX 12 Video Card - Newegg.com
[08:21:42] <manicennui> There are four for that card.
[08:21:45] <manicennui> I've seen more.
[08:21:55] <quanticle> manicennui: The thing you have to realize is: none of that shit matters unless you care about what kinds of LED strobe lighting you want your graphics card to be flashing as you're playing.
[08:22:07] <quanticle> They're not selling "separate variations"
[08:22:13] <quanticle> They're selling *exactly the same chip*
[08:22:20] <quanticle> With different cooling systems and LED packages
[08:22:26] <manicennui> I'm not saying the chip is different
[08:22:27] <manicennui> Jesus Christ
[08:22:40] <quanticle> Yes you are. You literally just said that.
[08:22:45] <manicennui> Think about this from the viewpoint of the average gamer who doesn't give a shit about specs
[08:22:52] <quanticle> >I have literally seen the page where you could choose between a dozen variations of one chip for one generation.
[08:22:53] <drakonis> lol
[08:22:55] <manicennui> And I just want to buy a damn video card.
[08:23:01] <drakonis> average gamer who doesnt give a shit about specs
[08:23:08] <manicennui> Yes.
[08:23:10] <drakonis> you most certainly have to if you need to play a specific game
[08:23:16] <quanticle> manicennui: The average gamer who doesn't give a shit about specs buys a goddamn console and is done with it
[08:23:21] <manicennui> Contrary to what geeks want to believe, most gamers don't actually care about this stuff.
[08:23:30] <quanticle> PC parts *are* for people who care about specs
[08:23:38] <manicennui> Nah
[08:23:39] <drakonis> i want to buy a goddamn amd gpu but i cant get one for a reasonable price
[08:23:49] <quanticle> drakonis: Yeah, welcome to the club
[08:23:50] <manicennui> There are tons and tons of people who build and rely on others to pick parts
[08:23:50] <drakonis> fucking god
[08:23:53] <quanticle> You and everyone else on the planet
[08:23:56] <manicennui> Because they don't want to deal with this shit.
[08:24:00] <drakonis> also i need advice on a particular thing lol
[08:24:04] <drakonis> fucking video games man
[08:24:28] <drakonis> i spent a bunch of cash on some nexus mods thing and now i keep thinking about whether i should refund it
[08:24:44] <drakonis> but then i look into mods for bethsoft games and think about how to automate this shit
[08:25:01] <drakonis> then i find out i need to spend money on a monthly basis to maintain the ability to do so
[08:25:06] <quanticle> manicennui: So just buy a gaming laptop, then? You're guaranteed to have a CPU and GPU combination that'll work well, and it'll all be preassembled for you with drivers preinstalled. Seems perfect for the PC gamer who doesn't like to pick and choose
[08:25:41] <manicennui> "gaming laptop" seems idiotic IMHO
[08:26:02] <quanticle> Says the dude who can't be bothered to like... read a number
[08:26:10] <manicennui> Seems like a good way to have inadequate cooling.
[08:26:15] <manicennui> I can be bothered.
[08:26:31] <drakonis> picking a gpu isnt difficult lol
[08:26:34] <quanticle> Okay? So then what's the problem
[08:26:34] <manicennui> And come on now.
[08:27:00] <manicennui> I can't tell if you two are being dense or disingenuous.
[08:27:03] <drakonis> nvidia gpus with raytracing? 20xx series and onwards
[08:27:22] <drakonis> amd gpus with raytracing? series 6xxx and onwards
[08:27:33] <quanticle> I'm pointing out solutions to your problems and you're like, "Nah, I want total fine-grained control but I *also* don't give a shit"
[08:28:06] <manicennui> You aren't pointing out solutions.
[08:28:09] <drakonis> you're disregarding the advice
[08:28:17] <manicennui> Because you are beating a strawman to death.
[08:28:17] <drakonis> what is it you're looking for then?
[08:28:17] <quanticle> And /win 10
[08:28:20] <quanticle> Whoops
[08:28:24] <manicennui> I'm not asking for advice.
[08:28:58] <drakonis> since we're still talking about game shit
[08:29:56] <drakonis> i can scarcely believe that this is skyrim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXwVdLkK6hY

[08:33:14] <drakonis> manicennui: i'm not sure what you want then
[08:34:26] <manicennui> I was stating that the Nvidia product lineups are not at all straightforward. Whether this is due to Nvidia (only slightly) or the card manufacturers (mostly) is irrelevant.
[08:35:11] <manicennui> It's all moot because of the availability really.
[08:49:57] *** Quits: bontaq (~user@ool-18e47f8d.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[09:14:37] <manicennui> For the 30 series, there are 7 distinct chips, and EVGA has 2 to 11 variants cards for each.
[09:14:59] <manicennui> The 3070 is also about double the MSRP that the 970 was.
[09:15:09] <quanticle> Right, like I said above: the various ASUS, eVGA, MSI, etc variants don't matter
[09:15:23] <manicennui> They might not, but you still have to pick one.
[09:15:26] <quanticle> Unless you're either 1) overclocking or 2) care about LEDs
[09:15:29] <quanticle> Just pick one
[09:15:30] <manicennui> And their price differs.
[09:15:41] <quanticle> That makes it easy
[09:16:25] <quanticle> This isn't like the bad old days of GPUs where picking the cheap one would get you the ones made with dodgy heatsinks that would overheat your card (Sapphire, I'm looking at you)
[09:16:43] <quanticle> If you're running the card at standard specs, they all work fine
[09:16:52] <quanticle> The manufacturer variants are there to support overclockres
[09:16:55] <quanticle> *overclockers
[09:16:56] <manicennui> I never had problems with dodgy components because I always research them and never overclock.
[09:17:06] <manicennui> I'm sure they do, but there is more to it than that.
[09:17:20] <quanticle> Yeah, there's also LED lighting packages
[09:17:35] <quanticle> Because maybe you want your case to be lit up like an Ibiza nightclub
[09:17:35] <manicennui> I have a 970. I've looked at building a new machine at various points.
[09:17:40] <quanticle> (Hey, I don't judge)
[09:17:42] <manicennui> The 1070 was not really worth the money at the time.
[09:17:57] <manicennui> Now the 3070 is not even in the same price range.
[09:18:02] <manicennui> If it were actually available.
[09:18:09] <manicennui> It's actually at least triple.
[09:18:16] <manicennui> But the MSRPs are about double.
[09:18:50] <quanticle> Yeah, well, the MSRPs have also gone up because of the shortage (just not as much as the actual grey market prices)
[09:18:51] <manicennui> To be clear, the 1070 was not worth the money as an upgrade.
[09:20:24] <quanticle> I don't know about that. I had a 980Ti, and frankly, I kind of regret not waiting for the 1080. It was a lot better (even though the 980Ti was also very good)
[09:21:09] <manicennui> Looking at EVGA's variations for the 3070, they sell them at 3 different clock rates.
[09:21:35] <manicennui> quanticle: I meant that I already owned the 970, and it wasn't worth it to pay another ~300-400 for a 1070.
[09:21:41] <manicennui> The 970 was still good enough.
[09:21:46] <manicennui> So it was not a worthwhile upgrade.
[09:22:01] <manicennui> That probably changed with the next generation.
[09:22:07] <manicennui> But I didn't look for a couple years.
[09:22:26] <manicennui> And then I tried again a year or so ago and realized that it is basically impossible to get what you want unless you are willing to pay a fortune.
[09:23:21] <manicennui> Buying a Samsung SSD is equally frustrating.
[09:27:14] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair
[09:27:52] <quanticle> At this point, I have resigned myself to waiting until 2023 before I can upgrade my gaming PC
[09:28:25] <quanticle> Going by guidance from Intel and TSMC, that's how long it's going to take for them to bring additional manufacturing capacity to bear on the problem
[09:28:59] <bkero> Would anything coming out of Intel's fabs be competitive in 2023?
[09:33:43] <quanticle> Who even knows? I saw a theory that the current chip shortage was helping Intel because people have a choice right now between shitty Intel parts that they *can* buy versus good AMD parts that they *cannot*. So, in theory, if Intel can get its shit together (which there is precedent for: see Prescott -> Sandy Bridge), there is a scenario where the chip shortage ends right as Intel announces a
[09:33:46] <quanticle> new part that brings it back up to parity with AMD's performance and AMD basically missed out on a boatload of profit because it was supply constrained.
[09:34:38] <bkero> Heh that's a theory.
[09:34:55] <bkero> But you can buy Ryzen parts now.
[09:35:17] <bkero> Just go on Newegg and Amazon and you can get Ryzen 5xxx parts for MSRP
[09:35:37] <quanticle> Huh, really? So it's just GPUs that are now supply constrained?
[09:35:41] <bkero> Yup
[09:35:44] <manicennui> Are people going to give up on cryptogambling in 2023?
[09:35:46] <bkero> I bought my 5900X for MSRP a few months ago
[09:38:47] <quanticle> manicennui: No, but by then TSMC should have its capacity expansions in place
[09:38:58] <quanticle> So they can make cards for gamers *and* cryptogamblers
[09:40:03] <quanticle> And also hopefully by then either 1) Ethereum has finally put in place proof-of-stake, which would make mining drastically less profitable or 2) undergone a significant price correction
[09:44:03] <manicennui> It already lost like a third of its value this year.
[09:44:24] <manicennui> From its peak.
[09:44:26] <manicennui> Going back up though.
[09:44:46] <manicennui> Right now the big dips seem to encourage people to buy in.
[09:45:50] <bkero> If not TSMC, then who?
[09:46:08] <bkero> who else is tooling up for 3nm and has a chance of achieving it in a timeframe where it would be commercially viable?
[09:46:52] <quanticle> https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros
[09:46:53] <buttsbot> Intel's Process Roadmap to 2025: with 4nm, 3nm, 20A and 18A?!
[09:47:14] <quanticle> The ?! is the perfect punctuation for this headline
[09:50:37] <bkero> Yeah. Roadmap.
[09:50:46] <bkero> Let's see what gets delivered.
[09:51:37] <quanticle> Exactly :D
[09:52:03] <quanticle> I saw that and I was like, "Lol, you still haven't delivered 10nm fully, and you're talking about 18-angstrom? C'mon"
[10:11:21] <quanticle> bkero: But, on the other hand: https://www.anandtech.com/show/16846/intels-first-highprofile-ifs-fab-customer-qualcomm-jumps-on-board-for-20a-process

[10:16:47] <quanticle> I always wondered at why players of those kinds of games *also* tend to be the ones bragging about their hardware. First of all, they all set their graphics settings to low or medium, to avoid distracting particle effects that might cause them to miss a critical cue giving away the position of an opponent. Secondly, how much graphics horsepower do you really need to display grey concrete
[10:16:50] <quanticle> buildings against a tan desert background, really?

[10:20:41] <quanticle> Yeah, things have gotten weird

[10:21:52] <buttsbot> Intel‚Äôs Possible Rationale For Buying GlobalFoundries, Inc.
[11:01:06] <indigo> quanticle: yeah but you need fast graphics for all the FPS
[11:02:48] <indigo> Cause they usually run high res and frame rates
[11:05:17] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough, but there's something really annoying to me about using all this graphics hardware to... display a grey-on-tan scene
[11:05:34] <quanticle> Even if the scene is 3840x2160 and updates 144 times every second
[11:08:30] <manicennui> Far more annoying to me that people are buying them for crypto.
[11:13:07] <quanticle> Oh yeah, that's a given
[11:13:16] <quanticle> I meant like... among gamers
[11:13:26] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[11:16:22] <manicennui> Is there anything about gamers that isn't annoying?
[11:27:55] <dcz> they don't use Arch?
[11:33:04] <manicennui> Haven't you heard about SteamOS switching to Arch?
[11:33:13] <manicennui> And what is wrong with Arch?
[11:49:06] <dcz> the "btw I use Arch" meme is an annoying thing
[11:49:12] <dcz> but you have a point
[11:49:16] <quanticle> Nothing is wrong with Arch, it's just that Arch *users* have a reputation of being like vegans
[11:49:37] <quanticle> "How do ask whether someone is an Arch user?" "You don't need to, they'll tell you"
[11:58:12] <manicennui> I rather deal with Arch users than gamers
[11:59:22] <manicennui> I can't get over how amazed I was by the first two Evangelion movies and how less amazing the last two were.
[11:59:43] <manicennui> When I finished the second movie my head was swimming.
[12:03:19] <quanticle> Really? I don't know, maybe it's because I watched the show, but I was honestly less than impressed with all of the movies
[12:03:33] <quanticle> I felt like the addition of Mari was wholly unnecessary
[12:03:51] <quanticle> She adds nothing; she's just there to be otaku eye candy
[12:04:27] <manicennui> I didn't care about her
[12:06:02] <manicennui> Were you a fan of the TV series?
[12:07:34] <quanticle> Sort of. I liked it a lot up through Episode 20 or so. After that the art starts to suffer (because Gainax is running out of money) and Anno starts getting more and more bizarre with the plot
[12:08:13] <quanticle> And everything starts getting incredibly introspective, with long scenes that take place solely inside a character's (usually Shinji's) head
[12:08:37] <quanticle> End of Evangelion was good. I liked that.
[12:08:40] <manicennui> Ah, I had never seen any Evangelion anything.
[12:08:45] <manicennui> So my experience was probably different.
[12:09:10] <manicennui> Seems like people prefer the story in the TV series better, minus the last two episodes, plus the End of Evangelion.
[12:09:55] <dcz> I couldn't make it through 10 episodes of the series
[12:11:01] <dcz> it wasn't exceptionally anything...
[12:15:26] <quanticle> I liked the animation in the TV series better, to be honest. I'm re-watching the movies now, and I've just reached the scene where the conventional military forces are seen battling the first Angel. In the movies, it's depicted as a bunch of streaks of light hitting the Angel ending in explosions, each one representing a missile or projectile weapon. And yeah, that makes sense with the modern
[12:15:29] <quanticle> anime aesthetic, and streaks of light are way easier to do with modern computerized animation tools. But in the original Evangelion? That scene went like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs0p9Nd8WEA
[12:15:29] <buttsbot> missile clip from Evangelion episode 01 - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs0p9Nd8WEA
[12:15:31] <quanticle> Look at how much more *physical* that is. Not realistic. I mean, there's no way any missile would actually explode after being peeled like an onion like that. But you can feel the impact of the missile upon the Angel in a way that you just can't when you see a bunch of abstract streaks of light.
[12:18:40] <quanticle> When I watch the original Evangelion TV show, I get the feeling that the animators *cared*, whereas when I watch the movie remake, it's like, yes it's a competently done professional job, but they're not going above and beyond like they did in the TV show.
[12:18:42] <quanticle> But, on the other hand, going above and beyond with the TV show nearly ruined Gainax, so... maybe it was a conscious tradeoff.
[12:20:41] <manicennui> Yeah, it seemed like there was one team doing all of the buildings and mechanical stuff, which would amazeballs in the movies.
[12:20:45] <manicennui> And the other stuff was just okay.
[12:23:33] <manicennui> Actually most of the animation in the first two movies is pretty damn good.
[12:23:53] <manicennui> The third seemed to drop off a bit
[12:23:59] <manicennui> But the fourth was a bit better.
[12:24:02] <quanticle> Man, the more I look at that little clip, the more impressed I am by it. The way the missile's exhaust blurs out the body when seen from the rear. The way the Angel's arm flexes on impact. That one small moment when the force of the missile is matching the Angel. That delay between the missile getting shredded and the eventual explosion. Someone really thought that scene through, even though
[12:24:05] <quanticle> it was just like... a random throwaway scene during the initial setup phase of the show. The TV show is full of little moments like that.Hasn't the mental health profession always been an intensely politicized environment? I'm thinking back to the huge fights over whether homosexuality ought to be classified as a mental illness, and it seems psychology and psychiatry have always been at the
[12:24:07] <quanticle> intersection of medicine and politics.
[12:24:12] <quanticle> What the heck
[12:25:01] <quanticle> Friggin middle click paste, I stg
[12:25:13] <dcz> that was a surprising twist

[21:29:09] <manicennui> And none of this is new.
[21:29:16] <manicennui> I've known about it for over a decade.
[21:29:42] <manicennui> People really into "the environment" seem to often be ignorant of it though.
[21:31:35] <manicennui> Using your own cloth/nylon bags and avoiding as much packaging as possible is really your best bet.
[21:32:18] <manicennui> Here is it really easy to avoid bags and such. Most places will let me just throw whatever I buy in my backpack/messenger bag.
[21:32:47] <companion_cube> Avoiding packaging is less easy though
[21:32:57] <manicennui> You get used to just walking into stores wearing a backpack.
[21:33:11] <manicennui> Of course I'm probably hassled a lot less being a white guy.
[21:33:12] <gwozniak> Yeah, avoiding all the plastic wrap is tough

[21:45:05] <manicennui> It's sad that we have to settle for Biden, who is still pretty awful.

[22:04:58] <manicennui> The bulk of the Democratic party is traditional conservatives.
[22:05:14] <manicennui> Americans are confused because Republicans call themselves conservatives, but they are right-wing authoritarians.
[22:05:30] <manicennui> They don't care about conserving anything.
[22:05:34] <manicennui> They care about winning.
[22:05:37] <manicennui> And they are good at it.
[22:05:52] <manicennui> They'd gladly give up the religious nonsense if they could win that way.
