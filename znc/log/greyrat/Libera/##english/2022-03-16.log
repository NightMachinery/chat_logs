[04:57:19] <twb> It's gendered in *some* dialects anyway
[04:59:01] <TimMc> So some claim. :-)
[04:59:42] <TimMc> Its non-gendered status seems to be fairly tenuous even in those dialects.
[05:04:03] <twb> Speaking as a third-waver, I think there's better hills to die on
[05:04:10] <TimMc> One day I was in high school (central Virginia, ~2000) someone told me they'd see some people having sex in the stairwell. (Realistically, they were probably just kissing.) I reported this to another friend as "[Bob] said he saw a coupla' guy having sex in the stairwell". I in fact meant it in a non-gendered way, but because it related to sex, and sex relates to gender, it was taken to mean males 
[05:04:16] <TimMc> specifically.
[05:04:31] <TimMc> twb: Agreed. :-P
[05:04:44] <TimMc> *guys

[05:35:30] <LjL> "pretend"
[05:36:46] <TimMc> As a form of address ("hey guys") it's pretty well ungendered.

[12:06:29] <Jmabsd> what is meant by "reset" is not clear to me due to lack of context.
[12:08:48] <Jong> I wrote "tests" because it makes more sense to me that code tests are added. The act of testing can't be added to a code base, but the test code can

[18:35:31] <xau> If it's a business or professional soft demand, you can indicate intent to follow up aggressively in the case of delay, politely (and very formally):
[18:35:38] <xau> "I look forward to your early reply."
[18:37:05] <xau> Or, if you are pushing and at the same time showing deference to an honoured person, or a powerful person, or simply a person who has the power to ignore you, you could try:
[18:37:24] <xau> "Would you please reply at your earliest convenience."
[18:37:39] <xau> Using a period there instead of a question mark is deliberate.
[18:38:12] <xau> Stating a demand as a request is one of the advanced judo moves in English (and many other languages).

[18:41:01] <xau> I sincerely thank you LuisR14.  My sincerity is not feigned. 
[18:44:39] <xau> I do have PTSD about malapropisms and typos since discovering when chatting at a glittering cocktail party that I had been confusing "remuneration" and "renumeration" for year, and since discovering that I had signed and submitted a thesis to three referees containing a critical topical proper noun non-capitalized throughout.

[18:46:25] *** Joins: SkunkyLaptop (~skunky@user/skunky)
[18:46:43] <TimMc> GuiToris: Not to mention emoticons.
[18:48:08] <LuisR14> one is with text, the other is graphical image

[18:48:25] <TimMc> Both are with text.
[18:48:34] <TimMc> Except where they're not.
[18:49:32] <TimMc> "Emoji" is a technical term with a slightly vague definition, but refers to a character that is intended for display with a glyph that can contain color, and is often pictographic.
[18:49:42] <TimMc> It's actually text.
[18:50:06] <TimMc> (in the software sense)
[18:50:20] <TimMc> Originally these were single characters, but recently there are combining forms so that a sequence of characters are displayed as a single glyph.
[18:51:17] <TimMc> Emoticons are also built from text, but are a series of characters originally intended for a *different* purpose that are strung together so as to form an image, e.g. ":-)"
[18:51:33] <TimMc> These are sometimes known as smilies.
[18:51:48] <LuisR14> !d emoji
[18:51:50] <tinsoldier> emoji — Noun: 1. A digital graphic icon with a unique code point used to represent a concept or object, originally used in Japanese text messaging but since adopted internationally in other contexts such as social media. Or, by extension, any non-standard emoji-like image inserted inline in text, i.e. an image emoticon. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emoji
[18:52:39] <LuisR14> uses text to invoke, but is an image
[18:53:02] <TimMc> LuisR14: Arguably, so is "A".
[18:53:29] <LuisR14> !d emoticon
[18:53:30] <tinsoldier> emoticon — Noun: 1. A graphical representation of a particular emotion of the writer, used especially in SMS, email, or other electronic communication. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emoticon
[18:53:35] <TimMc> Unicode code point 41 is "A", but that's just text; a font translates that text into an image (a glyph).
[18:54:00] <TimMc> But you can also find systems that have "emoji" that are in fact not textually based, and are not portable to other platforms. People can upload custom images and give them short names. These are a different meaning of "emoji" but the distinction is lost on most users.
[18:54:03] <LuisR14> that's what i mean
[18:54:24] <TimMc> And emoticons sometimes get translated into images too, whether the user wants them to or not.
[18:57:23] <TimMc> More than you probably ever wanted to know about emoji: https://eev.ee/blog/2016/04/12/apple-did-not-invent-emoji/
[18:58:34] <LuisR14> smiley is text afaik
[18:59:09] <GuiToris> is this a smiley :) and is this an emoji 😊 ?
[18:59:21] <GuiToris> however emoticon totally confused me
[18:59:22] <TimMc> yeah
[18:59:26] <LuisR14> yea
[18:59:37] <TimMc> Emoticon is just smiley, for the most part.

[18:59:52] <TimMc> You might not refer to :-( as a smiley. :-P

[19:00:41] <GuiToris> yes, how weird that is, a smiley that is not smiling

[23:28:35] <blkshp> Bahahaha lol
[23:28:50] <blkshp> I would have put "Cannabis" in there instead of alcohol.
[23:29:34] <GuiToris> ahh, you cannot add milk to it
[23:30:14] <GuiToris> I haven't drunk alcohol for 21 years, I know what you are thinking ... poor guy :(
[23:31:11] <blkshp> I have had 1 whisky today because I spent a long time on the phone. 2 guinnesses yesterday, nothign monday, 1 guinness sunday.
[23:31:14] <blkshp> So not too much
[23:31:39] <TimMc> I've never had a drink.
[23:31:46] <blkshp> Why?
[23:32:10] <GuiToris> I think if I drank any of those I would be sent to detox
[23:32:11] <TimMc> I've tasted alcohol a few times, and smelled it many times, and it does not seem like something made for ingestion. :-)

[23:32:25] <tinsoldier> ingestion — Noun: 1. The action of ingesting, or consuming something orally, whether it be food, drink, medicine, or other substance.

[23:32:56] <TimMc> I think I'm just very sensitive to the smell of some of the fermentation products.
[23:33:10] <blkshp> It's pricey, dangerous and, while it can improve an evening out, it's kind of a bad idea.
[23:33:26] <GuiToris> TimMc, I don't like the smell of wine either
[23:33:27] <TimMc> Oh, I'm well past the point of feeling any kind of social pressure over it.
[23:33:42] <TimMc> Now I just find it mystifying.
[23:34:14] <blkshp> :D
[23:34:23] <TimMc> I like a whole bunch of other fermented foods, though.
[23:34:36] <GuiToris> stinky cheese?
[23:34:41] <TimMc> yep
[23:34:43] <blkshp> sauerkraut is horrid.

[23:35:57] <blkshp> I love blue cheese.
[23:36:09] <GuiToris> Maybe it's a European thing

[23:39:51] <blkshp> well its not, its a german product that we dont rename,
[23:40:00] <blkshp> Proper noun
[23:40:18] <TimMc> English just imports words without changing them, for better or worse.
[23:40:40] <TimMc> In Spanish it's "chucrut".
[23:41:40] <TimMc> blkshp: I used to dislike sauerkraut, but I'd only ever had the stuff that came in a metal can. It was pretty unpleasant.
[23:41:53] <bin> i hate it
[23:42:00] <TimMc> I don't remember what kind of unpleasant, exactly, but I do remember it was soft. :-(
[23:42:05] <blkshp> I like deep fried cabbage (otherwise known as chinese seaweed)
[23:42:25] <TimMc> And then one day I tried some made by a local producer that had juniper berries in it, and it was so fresh and crunchy and delicious!
[23:42:49] <TimMc> Now I make my own, and I like the result. I probably would still not like the storebought stuff.
[23:43:33] <TimMc> (Eden Foods actually makes a good sauerkraut, but I don't think that was around when I was young.)
[23:44:06] <TimMc> One thing I noticed is that when I make it, it goes through a sulfur-smelling phase that I don't like. And then later it clears up.
