[09:46:38] <darwin> on Savannah you can use git but I see no way to report bugs

[09:48:31] <jxself> Savannah has a bug tracker. It can be turned on or off by the project administrator.
[09:49:00] <jxself> Just like most Savannah features have a checkbox for on/off.

[10:00:15] <klys> I see lots of recommendations about commenting and documenting your source.  My feeling is that the documentation of my program should be more of a conversation.  So, until someone asks me why my program exists or what they can do with it, I have rather little impetus to document everything.
[10:01:50] <klys> Also I don't see any explanation about why GNU programs use /* comment */ rather than // comment.
[10:03:42] <jxself> Someone had to decide.
[10:03:43] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Comments.html
[10:05:14] <klys> yea that's the page I was reading
[10:05:34] <jxself> One could probably ask 'why anything' :)
[10:05:50] <thegoat> such things are all a matter of taste
[10:05:51] <jxself> Why C? Why put the braces in those positions? etc.
[10:06:00] <jxself> Exactly! :)
[10:06:13] <thegoat> a project lead is best to standardize that stuff so it's clean
[10:06:16] <jxself> Someone had to come up with the GNU standard.
[10:06:37] <jxself> Or in this case many people, but still.
[10:06:43] <thegoat> otherwise u get people like me naming functions after pop singers and sparsely explaining things, lol
[10:06:51] <klys> my current candidate program is kind of messy and not commented, and only works to produce debug output as a concept.  I have it hosted on github.  Should I consider savannah?
[10:06:51] <thegoat> :p
[10:07:11] <thegoat> klys, you don't have to consider savannah, but I'd say you should consider leaving github
[10:07:11] <jxself> Does it meet the Savannah hosting criteria?
[10:07:32] <klys> I think so, other than the coding and documentation recommendations
[10:07:36] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria.en.html
[10:07:45] <jxself> GitHub got a big fat F - https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html
[10:07:52] <klys> I think so, other than the /commenting/ and documentation recommendations
[10:07:56] <jxself> Not surprising there.
[10:08:28] <thegoat> If I'm not incorrect github is a huge source pool for microsoft's programming AI
[10:08:39] <thegoat> which will probably be producing proprietary code
[10:08:45] <klys> thing is AI can't write code
[10:08:54] <klys> that requires manual effort
[10:08:59] <thegoat> it can now, from what I've read
[10:09:07] <klys> not anything important
[10:09:09] <jxself> Why are you applying the GNU Coding Standards to yourself? Is your package officially deemed part of GNU?
[10:09:27] <klys> jxself, because someone recommends savannah, or appears to
[10:09:44] <jxself> That doesn't actually answer that question...
[10:10:06] <jxself> The GNU Coding Standards are for GNU programs. GRUB. Emacs. Those.
[10:10:27] <jxself> Listed on https://www.gnu.org/software/
[10:10:42] <jxself> Is your package officially deemed part of GNU?
[10:10:43] <klys> I have a few projects (around seven) within a personal github account.  If I were to use savannah instead, perhaps for one of those, I would need to follow GNU coding standards.  Have I answered your question yet?
[10:11:11] <jxself> Not really. I think there is a misunderstanding that anyone using Savannah needs to follow the GNU Coding Standards.
[10:11:33] <klys> please reread https://savannah.gnu.org/register/requirements.php
[10:11:58] <jxself> Yes; "All packages registered in savannah.gnu.org". Presumably your program will be on the nongnu part of Savannah.
[10:12:11] <klys> why?
[10:12:30] <klys> why would I want a nongnu label on my project?
[10:12:47] <jxself> SO I go back to: Is your program actually part of GNU? Did you actually go through https://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.en.html ?
[10:13:10] <klys> no, this is an irc conversation, not a query with the website.

[10:13:55] <jxself> Savannah can also be used to hose things that are not desginated official GNU components; those project when registered live on savnannah.nongnu.org. The GNU Coding Standards only apply to official GNU packages.
[10:15:15] <jxself> You can still follow them if you want to; I'm just trying to point out you don't actually have to and so you know you don't think it's an actual requirement unless you go through the process on https://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.en.html and end up with RMS (or one of the delegates) appointing your program as a GNU Package and you as a GNU Maintainer.

[10:17:59] <klys> well I may have to do that.  I think some of the answers would be common sense though.  Would you care to discuss it?

[10:20:01] <klys> I mean my project, specifically.
[10:20:23] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@124.77.94.254)
[10:21:42] <jxself> I'm not any of the Savannah Hackers and so I wouldn't really play a role in the approval or denial of your program though.
[10:22:01] <klys> I know.  I just think it would lead to a fruitful pseudo-evaluation
[10:23:29] <jxself> OK so what is your program and where is it?
[10:23:49] <klys> git clone git://github.com/mdasoh/header_parser.git
[10:24:00] <klys> it's a C header parser
[10:24:29] <klys> as I said above, it produces debug output so far, though it would be designed to produce a parseable intermediary output (not C)
[10:25:09] <klys> It's designed to take input from a .c program, after the cpp preprocessing step.
[10:25:45] <klys> It therefore parses many system headers.  As of now it does not recognize any inline asm, so it doesn't work on systems newer than say, gcc-7
[10:26:13] <jxself> OK; I immediately see that it lacks copyright & license statements so it would automatically fail a submission to Savannah.
[10:26:16] <jxself> https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/HowToGetYourProjectApprovedQuickly/
[10:26:20] <jxself> "Apply valid copyright and license notices ... using our templates to each source file in your project; include a copy of the license..."
[10:26:55] <klys> okay I get the licensing questions, and upon uploading the project I could add the LICENSE file.
[10:27:10] <jxself> Adding a license file itself is not enough.
[10:27:12] <jxself> "Apply valid copyright and license notices ... using our templates to each source file in your project; include a copy of the license..."
[10:27:15] <jxself> To each source file.
[10:27:22] <jxself> And: Use a license compatible with the GNU GPL, and use the "or any later version" formulation in your license notices. Implication: the license must be compatible with GNU GPLv3-or-later. 
[10:27:57] <jxself> If you wanted to use GPLv3-or-later, there is a how-to in https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html
[10:28:26] <klys> well this feels like something I did not come here to discuss.  I guess that's something I had thought of, yet I would just do it when uploading it to savannah.
[10:29:11] <jxself> You mentioned wanting a "pseudo-evaluation" so I am pretending to review it as if I were one of the Savannah Hackers.
[10:29:17] <jxself> Perhaps I misunderstood what you wanted.
[10:29:52] <klys> a review of the purpose and scope of my program, its relevance to gnu, and any other hanging related questions
[10:34:00] <jxself> The relevance to GNU would only come up if you actually offered it to GNU via that evaluation process linked earlier. That's not the same as getting hosted on Savannah. A project can be hosted on Savannah without being part of or indeed any use to GNU and without any connection to it.
[10:34:16] <klys> yeah so it would come up
[10:35:50] <jxself> If you'll be going through gnu-eval, I probably can't help much there. Probably best to write to gnueval@gnu.org.
[10:36:36] <jxself> I need to get to bed though so good night from my time zone.
