[00:10:51] <dongbei> hey hey hey
[00:11:30] <zbrown[m]> o/
[00:12:45] <dongbei> do you guys have a hard time hiring right now?  This is the first time I've been on the other side of an interview loop and I've found that people aren't as good as I was expecting them to be.

[00:13:31] <dsc_> dongbei: what are you looking for specifically
[00:13:47] <dsc_> can imagine finding React people is more trivial than Qt developers
[00:13:58] <dongbei> you'd be surprised.
[00:14:08] <dongbei> golang/pythong 2 yoe.
[00:14:12] <c355E3B> dongbei: we've had positions open for over a year now
[00:14:31] <dongbei> algorithmically, just be able to print out every node from a tree based structure.
[00:15:05] <dongbei> they seem to have a really hard time getting past the standard boilerplate that they've probably practiced...
[00:15:10] <dsc_> python 2?
[00:15:24] <dongbei> 3
[00:15:29] <dongbei> we're on 3.9
[00:15:32] <dsc_> nice
[00:15:59] <c355E3B> I think the big problem is that there is a good 40% of the market that everyone wants
[00:16:00] <dsc_> dongbei: let me guess, you are looking for django developers?
[00:16:04] <c355E3B> that isn't moving or has already moved
[00:17:02] <dongbei> but the other 60% should've learned this stuff, bootcamp or otherwise.
[00:17:37] <dongbei> and yeah, the team that's being filled is moving from django
[00:17:52] <dongbei> hence the golang
[00:18:04] <dsc_> more than half of the recruiters that approach me for Python work want Django
[00:18:26] <dongbei> what do you even want to work on?
[00:18:43] <dsc_> while most *good* python developers I know, including myself of course, despise django
[00:19:09] <dongbei> it's attractive to people who's domain isn't really python.  that's the funny thing.
[00:19:22] <dsc_> right
[00:19:59] <dongbei> my domain is the frontend, it's not my team but I'm helping out.
[00:20:01] <dsc_> so finding skilled django developers might be somewhat of an oxymoron
[00:20:22] * dsc_ runs from the angry django mob that disagrees
[00:20:42] <dongbei> my backends are in c++, feel free to hate on them.
[00:20:52] <dsc_> ok :P

[03:10:14] <technomancy> did that get canned too?
[03:11:21] <zbrown[m]> not to my knowledge: https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr
[03:11:22] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - IronLanguages/dlr: Dynamic Language Runtime ] - github.com
[03:12:30] <zbrown[m]> It still periodically gets releases. None of the projects are officially dead as far as I know so much as:
[03:12:30] <zbrown[m]> - in the beginning, it was just some open source projects
[03:12:30] <zbrown[m]> - Microsoft hired some folks from that community for a while to do stuff
[03:12:30] <zbrown[m]> - Microsoft decided to pull back from those projects and spun off the work into the open source community again
[03:12:46] <zbrown[m]> I believe there are still some MSFT folk working in that space but only peripherally
[03:13:37] <zbrown[m]> A lot of the de-emphasis was when Typescript got popular. Basically - in the timeframe that Google was threatening to replace JAvascript with Dart in browers, Microsoft had the same thought and there was serious consideration on whether IronRuby or IronPython could serve as the backing implementation for a browser-based Python
[03:13:38] <technomancy> I like how the readme apologizes for having documentation in Word format
[03:14:00] <technomancy> like, yeah it's bad, but at least you're embarrassed about it. good for you.
[03:14:04] <zbrown[m]> independently, TypeScript was born and that sorta quickly eliminated that design
[03:14:14] <technomancy> ...?
[03:14:19] <zbrown[m]> which, ultimately, Google came to a similar conclusion about
[03:14:23] <technomancy> but typescript isn't a runtime at all
[03:14:44] <technomancy> seems completely different
[03:14:44] <zbrown[m]> The point is that because TypeScript became real, there was no need to really replace Javascript in the browser
[03:14:48] <zbrown[m]> this was a competitive advantage thing
[03:14:53] <technomancy> oh wait what?
[03:14:56] <technomancy> DLR targeted the browser?
[03:15:01] <zbrown[m]> see my comment re: Google thinking about replacing Javascript with Dart
[03:15:07] <zbrown[m]> That was the idea once upon a time
[03:15:23] <technomancy> oh, ok I missed your one line above about that
[03:15:24] <technomancy> bizarre
[03:15:26] <zbrown[m]> In the mid-2000's, Google and Microsoft were considering ditching JAvascript
[03:15:43] <zbrown[m]> Microsoft threw their lot in with common scripting languages and backing them on .NET - a reasonable approach IMO
[03:15:49] <zbrown[m]> Google made a brand new language - see Dart
[03:15:58] <technomancy> python's just a wild-ass choice for that
[03:15:59] <zbrown[m]> (I worked close-ish to these groups in that timeframe)
[03:16:02] <technomancy> makes no sense
[03:16:08] <zbrown[m]> I mean so is ruby lol
[03:16:15] <technomancy> it has nothing going for it except a large user base
[03:16:22] <technomancy> yeah, same with ruby

[03:26:46] <iDrougge> Different goals.
[03:28:18] <brennen> i still use "scripting" sometimes colloquially, but it hasn't really felt like that useful a distinction in most realms for a long time now.  sorta seems to obscure more than it reveals.

[03:30:55] <brennen> like maybe if we had a shared understanding that a "scripting language" was one intended primarily for automating stuff in a host application, or something, but in a world where like 98% of the code we interact with by volume is probably javascript...
[03:34:49] <iDrougge> It even says so in the description in the case of JS.

It was written by a member of the Python steering council for people in the Python community. He's not saying you should choose Python over whatever your language of choice is, he's saying that if you're already in the Python
[10:04:37] <feoh> community, and people are shouting you down for wanting to choose Python for a project, there are several concrete steps that can be taken that will allow you to use the language that optimizes YOUR productivity while not sacrificing performance.

[20:13:56] <marshmellow[m]> ohh i think i see. so thread 1 and 5 ware waiting on this mutex, but thread 6 looks like it is the on who owns it based on the backtraces
[20:14:47] <epilys> probably yeah

[20:57:53] <feoh> But I do not feel this impacts the overall usefulness of his article to his intended audience. There were a few performance optimization strategies he cited that I wasn't aware of and I've been an avid Pythonista for ~6 years now
