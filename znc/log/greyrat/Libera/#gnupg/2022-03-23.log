[02:29:14] <naicam|ne> whats the best way to download a key straight from the keyserver into a file without importing it?
[02:30:15] <naicam|ne> or more specifically, an accepted method
[02:35:42] <duxsco> naicam|ne: while following rfc you could do https://dpaste.com/A3ZQWPZ29
[02:36:28] <naicam|ne> thanks
[02:37:03] <duxsco> instead of the hash you can also provide the uid's mail address
[02:37:17] <duxsco> i used the keys from here for testing https://github.com/nodejs/node
[02:38:22] <duxsco> if you want to get an idea how a keyserver works: https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-keyserver
[02:38:54] <duxsco> naicam|ne: ^
[02:39:06] <naicam|ne> good deal 
[02:39:49] <duxsco> in case of keys.openpgp.org you can even use "--tlsv1.3" to harden it a bit more
[02:40:18] <naicam|ne> ok ya thats what i would prefer 
[02:42:02] <duxsco> keep in mind that email only works in case of keys.openpgp.org if the owner confirmed ownership
[02:42:26] <naicam|ne> ya the keyserver i am trying to use is "pgp.surf.nl"
[02:43:24] <duxsco> dunno about that. there are the sources i use https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-config-and-scripts/blob/main/bin/pull.sh#L30
[02:43:30] <naicam|ne> right on
