[10:07:52] <xenu> if you don't have any programming experience, i *think* "beginning perl" by curtis poe is the best choice (it's not free, though)
[10:08:12] <xenu> don't confuse it with the other "beginning perl" by a different author
[10:09:04] <xenu> "learning perl" is also targeting complete beginners, although it does teach some bad practices, which is unfortuante
[10:09:54] <xenu> (iirc uses the following bad things: no strict, & subroutine calls, bareword filehandles)
[10:10:00] <xenu> it uses*
[10:11:01] <openbsdbeta> thank you so much xenu, i appreciate it alot
[10:11:52] <openbsdbeta> are there any simple perl programs i can look at the source code of to see how things work? im using ped for that right now

[10:21:40] <xenu> so perl is being used as a cli tool, like sed or grep, not for actual programs
[10:24:42] <openbsdbeta> that makes sense, i knew that perl is more for scripting and stuff, but i would like to eventually write a full program in it
[10:25:30] <openbsdbeta> another reason im learning perl is i want to write my own text editor, i really like line editors like led and ed, but i would like more of them to be around, with unique features, or new things

[10:27:47] <xenu> i think the best way is to start with *something*, no matter how badly structured or even not working, and then ask us for advice how to improve it :P
[10:29:05] <xenu> if you want to write a line-based editor then it should be pretty simple to start, just read from stdin in a loop and do something with the input
[10:30:21] <openbsdbeta> ah ok, that sounds pretty intuitive, i'll have a look at that and try to figure it out xenu

[19:32:24] <thrig> nevermore?
[19:32:44] <daemon> I still use POE for alsorts, but it is starting to get a little old and niche
[19:33:27] <daemon> latest project will be relying on mojo for all frontend stuff, so instead of using POE for all the backend things I figured time to truly learn io::async

[19:37:01] <daemon> must admit I still do adore POE though -_- it seems to simple; but time move on and all, I am sure I will feel the same way about io::async 4 or 5 scripts in
[19:38:01] <thrig> meanwhile POE can still be heard scratching at the other side of the wall
[19:38:30] <simcop2387> POE is conceptually a lot like the message passing object oriented systems of yester-year like small talk and such.  once i realized that i never had an issue with working with it.  that said i *wish* it had a better story for IPC/Remote message passing.

[20:28:12] <xenu> in other words
[20:28:52] <xenu> $line inside the for loop doesn't begin with "ID", so the condition that checks whether it starts with it (/^ID/) can't be true

[20:49:17] <xenu> the first condition checks wheter $line begins with "ID", the second checks whether id begins with "AC"
[20:49:22] <xenu> they can't both be simultaneously true
[20:49:51] <xenu> whether $line begins with "AC"*
[20:50:04] <sokan> oooooh I see
[20:50:12] <sokan> so it's either one OR the other
[20:50:43] <sokan> is it possible to parse the file and when it read ID do this _and_ when you see AC do this _and_ when you see the final do that

[20:59:38] <sokan> at least that's what I understand
[21:04:27] <xenu> sokan: with '$/ = "\n//";' present, the while() loop will run only once because there's only one "\n//" in the input file

[21:04:37] <xenu> $line will contain the contents of the entire file
[21:04:40] <sokan> ooooh
[21:04:52] <xenu> with the $/ commented-out, while() loop will be run for each line in the file
[21:05:37] <sokan> xenu: so why don't it read the third if?
[21:06:07] <xenu> the third condition is: if ($line =~ m/\n\s{5}(.*)/gs)
[21:06:19] <xenu> it can't possibly be true when you're reading line by line 
[21:06:31] <xenu> because it checks for something after a newline
[21:06:52] <xenu> $line contains "something\n", or if it's the last line, it could be "something"
[21:06:58] <xenu> there will never be anything after "\n"
[21:07:31] <sokan> Oh I see
