[00:22:04] <muaddib[m]> i made a heir block, but it isn't showing up in gnuradio. i'm using pybombs. is there somewhere i need to point my environment?
[00:22:49] <bkerler[m]> you need to add it to the cmakelist (add_subdirectory)
[00:23:18] *** Quits: __alex (~alex@ip5f5be2d7.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:23:54] <bkerler[m]> and then in the heir_block directory add the grc files to the cmakelist.txt. Easiest is to use gr_modtool to add a new block template.
[00:24:27] <bkerler[m]> I don't recommend to use pybombs at all as it's officially no longer supported (at least I saw that on the gnuradio page)
[00:25:05] <muaddib[m]> wait what?
[00:26:05] <muaddib[m]> where did you see that?
[00:26:12] <bkerler[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR
[00:26:47] <muaddib[m]> yes, no longer recommended but not unsupported
[00:27:08] <bkerler[m]> well .. only supported up to 3.8
[00:27:37] <bkerler[m]> anything above 3.8 : not supported obviously
[00:27:56] <muaddib[m]> where are you seeing that?
[00:28:11] <muaddib[m]> that's not what that section is saying at all.
[00:28:32] <bkerler[m]> I've tried pybombs with 3.10 and 3.11 ... and it clearly was broken :)
[00:30:15] <bkerler[m]> the last commit was in november 2021 to the pybombs repo
[00:30:20] <muaddib[m]> i've been using pybombs for multi-version development since it came out. you're probably the millionth person to say 'pybombs is broken' so maybe i'm a bit desensitized to that statement
[00:30:41] <muaddib[m]> depending on your definition of supported i'd say that's pretty recent
[00:30:51] <bkerler[m]> I've been using pybombs as well before. but no longer for 3.10 and higher :D
[00:30:59] <muaddib[m]> ugh
[00:31:02] <muaddib[m]> ok
[00:31:17] <bkerler[m]> I really liked pybombs, made things easier
[00:31:23] <muaddib[m]> agreed
[00:31:29] <bkerler[m]> that's why I'm now doing the same without pybombs
[00:31:46] <muaddib[m]> what are you using for multiple versions? docker?
[00:31:54] <muaddib[m]> bash environments?
[00:32:10] <bkerler[m]> no, I've made my own installer, bash environment based
[00:32:16] <bkerler[m]> it's much better than docker
[00:32:32] <bkerler[m]> if I do a mistake, I just kill the directory and rerun my install script
[00:33:28] <muaddib[m]> yea, docker can be a bit overkill, for 3.7 it's a good thing though cause of all the stale versions. it's RARE that i need 3.7 but not completely out of the equation yet
[00:33:42] <muaddib[m]> do you have your custom installer anywhere?
[00:34:03] <bkerler[m]> That's why I'm porting everything to 3.10. I want one gnuradio version that has everything working
[00:34:18] <bkerler[m]> no, not yet. I will publich my installer script as soon as all modules are ported
[00:34:19] <muaddib[m]> your work is deserving of a medal
[00:34:28] <bkerler[m]> publish, sorry :D
[00:34:52] <bkerler[m]> we will try to move things then into dragonos, with new ubuntu 22 lts
[00:35:41] <bkerler[m]> porting from 3.8 is a real mess. some modules are horrible to port because they didn't use gr_modtool
[00:36:16] <bkerler[m]> so you have a mix of modules with different names. and even worse, some oot modules have the same name, but with different content
[00:36:19] <bkerler[m]> like gr-reveng
[00:36:40] <bkerler[m]> as both gr-reveng repos do basically the same I simply merged them
[00:36:59] <bkerler[m]> but that doesn't work for all oot. especially those that haven't been maintained for 4-8 years
[00:37:08] <muaddib[m]> man, i havent thought about that one in a while
[00:37:27] <bkerler[m]> and even worse .. some mix the licenses
[00:37:51] <muaddib[m]> oof
[00:37:52] <bkerler[m]> so you have a bsd and gplv3 or mit license. and if the author doesn't allow the license to be mixed, you can't port anything
[00:38:17] <muaddib[m]> that's rough
[00:38:18] <muaddib[m]> hey, so heir blocks
[00:38:19] <muaddib[m]> when they get generated
[00:38:27] <muaddib[m]> they're supposed to go into .grc_gnuradio right?
[00:38:41] <muaddib[m]> or am i dated on that?
[00:38:46] <bkerler[m]> not nessarily. you can set the destination folder in the cmakelist.txt
[00:39:07] <muaddib[m]> i've always just opened the heir block, generated it and let gnuradio put it where it needs to go
[00:39:22] <bkerler[m]> that's the best you can do actually
[00:39:49] <bkerler[m]> but be aware you generate the mod for each version from newmod
[00:40:11] <bkerler[m]> because sometimes things change and with 3.10 they introduced a lot of folder structure changes
[00:40:31] <muaddib[m]> right, so for example right now i can't find my heir block anywhere
[00:41:05] <muaddib[m]> my regular block builds fine in 3.10 like you said, i've generated it but it doesn't show up after reloading
[00:41:09] <bkerler[m]> for example, most oot coders used their own name in the past, leading to issues with python module names. so they moved it to gnuradio/name instead to have no system conflicts
[00:41:42] <bkerler[m]> so people update their modules, but don't restructure the folders :)
[00:42:12] <bkerler[m]> if the block doesn't show it could be two reasons I think
[00:42:33] <bkerler[m]> 1. wrong environment settings
[00:43:35] <bkerler[m]> or 2. module doesn't get installed correctly (could be broken module, like imports in grc wrong)
[00:43:36] <muaddib[m]> wait, i got it
[00:43:39] <bkerler[m]> but I'm clearly no expert on that. I'm happy I was able to port the modules so far
[00:44:02] <muaddib[m]> no matter the level of ninjitsu i have in pybombs i still confuse myself sometimes
[00:44:25] <muaddib[m]> thanks though, i'll have to sharpen up some more on writing custom blocks.
[00:44:42] <bkerler[m]> me as well. lol.
[00:45:07] <bkerler[m]> gnuradio is still a painful way, even though some things are documented pretty well
[00:46:24] <bkerler[m]> especially gr-tests drive me crazy. couldn't get a single one to work on >= 3.9. need to read what has changed
