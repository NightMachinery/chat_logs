[02:17:42] <phrik> akrauze: reflector -p https -c <country> --score 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
[02:17:44] <akrauze> Because I was using mirror that was stated as successful sync on arch mirrors status page, but in reality was broken.
[02:17:50] <NetSysFire> how was it broken?
[02:18:23] <akrauze> It left me in a partial update state and that broke one package.
[02:18:52] <akrauze> I firstly thought it was a bug, and I reported it.

[03:08:08] <entropygain> hey guys - I am doing a pacman -S linux on the latest archiso which seems to work just fine
[03:08:38] <entropygain> the reason I am doing all of this is that I need to install the newest version of zfs to load my pools (unsupported features in earlier versions)
[03:09:18] <entropygain> however, when I try to modprobe zfs - it looks in the older 5.12.8 modules folders for zfs ( which it does not find ) instead of the new 5.12.10 ... is there a step I am skipping?
[03:09:29] <mpan> entropygain: rebooting the system.
[03:09:38] <mpan> (just like with all updates)
[03:09:39] <entropygain> but its the archiso
[03:09:45] <entropygain> so its all in ram

[03:10:54] <entropygain> if i reboot i will loose all the changes (pacman -S linux)
[03:10:58] <mpan> entropygain: you can’t load modules from a different kernel version.

[03:11:18] <entropygain> so basically I cannot upgrade the kernel version on the archiso?

[03:11:47] <mpan> entropygain: it’s not about directories being missing (though they are, of course), but about your kernel being 5.12.8 and expecting 5.12.8 modules.

[03:12:34] <mpan> entropygain: I suppose you could either build an ArchISO with newer kernel or load a newer kernel from some persistent location. But is that worth the effort?
[03:13:17] <entropygain> well really i am trying to install the latest possible zfs version so that i can load my existing pool and troubleshoot some issues
[03:13:37] <mpan> Must it be done from ArchISO?
[03:13:38] <entropygain> how can I check what the latest zfs version is for 5.12.8?
[03:14:04] <entropygain> i suppose not, but the reason why I wanted to use archISO is so that I can arch chroot
[03:14:27] <mpan> But you can also chroot from normal Arch installation.
[03:14:28] <entropygain> i want to load pool, mount, arch-chroot, pacman -Syu on the system
[03:14:40] <entropygain> I don't have another arch install on this system
[03:14:51] <mpan> Well, no idea then. :/
[03:14:54] <entropygain> unless you mean install arch on a usb stick?
[03:15:08] <mpan> entropygain: technically you can, though expect ultra slow speed.
[03:15:24] *** Quits: ixil (~ixil@82.197.178.137) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:15:28] <entropygain> what about finding the 5.12.8 compatible version for zfs and installing that from the archzfs repo?
[03:15:33] <entropygain> do you know how I can search for that?
[03:15:45] <mpan> Nope. Not even using ZFS myself.
[03:16:24] *** Joins: nooriz (~chris@105.163.201.89)
[03:16:36] <entropygain> how would you typically use pacman to see all available versions of a package, is that possible?
[03:17:25] <mpan> entropygain: there is only one version of a package in pacman.
[03:17:29] <mpan> *in Arch
[03:17:38] <entropygain> ah gotcha
[03:18:37] <entropygain> so I basically have to wait until archiso upgrades to 5.12.10 or something
[03:18:45] *** Quits: mfs (~mfs@user/mfs) (Quit: leaving)
[03:19:07] <mpan> Before someone tries to be more pedantic than I am: technically there can be different versions in different repos. [testing] may have versions newer than [base], [extra] or [community]. But that’s not exactly the same as having different versions of the same package that would be equivalent to each other.
[03:19:27] <entropygain> yeah i mean i see the lts version
[03:19:39] <entropygain> but that is for 5.10.43
[03:19:41] <mpan> But lts is a separate package.
[03:20:07] <mpan> It’s not a different version of linux package, it’s a separate linux-lts package.
[03:20:18] <entropygain> i see what you mean

[04:10:24] <BrainDamage> that the result will be truncated
[04:10:32] <BrainDamage> and likely the fs will be damaged
[04:10:57] <BrainDamage> and unless all your data is packed in the first sectors, lots of files damaged too
[04:11:09] <BrainDamage> why can't you just use rsync / cp?

[10:37:25] <Repentinus> petrj, amd64 is not set in stone, but I doubt you can convince the devs to add another architecture.

[10:45:02] <mpan> petrj: even if they would be unified (in fact peronnel is shared among those distros), the structures would need to be separate anyway.

[14:54:14] <HaMsTeRs> it's all happend right after I done a "Syu" upgrade yesterday.  So i'm not sure if it's the same timing of the SSD defect and system update or it's software issue after teh update
[14:54:43] <HaMsTeRs> so what I did is to downgraded the kernel version.  and it seems working fine now, but I just want to make sure my SSD is still in healthy state

[15:02:13] <MrAureliusR> Having a linux headache before bed. Was checking my email (using KMail on Arch) when suddenly it said "Akonadi personal services are not running. They must be running for this program to work." Checked journactl, mariadb crashed and had a core dump and akonadi relies on mysqld. Cannot for the life of me figure out why mariadb is refusing to start now. systemctl status of mariadb: https://termbin.com/n4dd
[15:02:49] <MrAureliusR> Doing some quick googling, others solved it by removing the ib* files from /var/lib/mysql ... I know those are the innodb files, and since nothing important is in there I figured why not, but no effect.
[15:02:52] <NetSysFire> systemctl status is always truncated. run journalctl -u mariadb to see the full output
[15:03:02] *** Quits: chemsmith (~chemsmith@user/chemsmith) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:03:02] <grawity> because akonadi doesn't use the system mariadb instance, and you probably never had it "installed" (system tables etc) to begin with
[15:03:19] <MrAureliusR> https://termbin.com/w49u
[15:03:27] <MrAureliusR> but I've been using kmail for months

[19:01:53] <petrj> i'm an xorg user and only read about architectural differences... so it seems like wayland should be faster (as it cuts the server overhead)?
[19:02:06] <NetSysFire> wayland is new and shiny, xorg is an old hacky mess
[19:02:08] <NetSysFire> !xorg
[19:02:10] <phrik> hacks on top of hacks
[19:04:52] <wez> Lets hacks!
[19:04:53] <mannu> i have noticed another set of bugs and glitches in wayland than i had with xorg
[19:05:33] <petrj> yea, every new shiny box comes with its own set of perks..
[19:05:37] <mannu> yeah
[19:05:37] <wez> mannu: Raise some bug reports and create some PRs!
[19:05:47] <mannu> i would if i had the time =(
[19:06:16] <mannu> anyway i find wayland works a lot better with my hidpi screen. everything just looks good no matter what graphical toolkit they used
[19:06:23] <petrj> like node.js is considered "old".. not long ago it used to be a new kid in town.. now something called dino is what khool kids are on about :P
[19:06:26] <mannu> with xorg i had to manually configure a billion things and everything was just a mess

[19:21:35] <raster> petrj: it can be minimally faster. it realluy won't speed the vast majority of things up. the real benefits are architecturally designing a zero-glitch display protocol into the system, where with x, if you get no tearing and such glitches, it's by luck, not design.

[19:22:34] <denisse> support for mutliple displays setups where the displays have different DPI is one of the major advantages of Wayland.
[19:23:06] <raster> petrj: 99% of accelerated rendering pipeline paths are essentially the same between x and wl, so thus it won't help with most of it. it does cut some indirection between client -> xserver -> wm and back for some paths like an initial window map (show) but it may cut like a few dozen or 100 or 200ms to the showing of a window - thats about really the biggest win there.
[19:23:13] <denisse> In Xorg it's a PITA to configure a HiDPI monitor with a regular DPI monitor, Wayland does it out of the box.
[19:23:43] *** Joins: archetech (~archetech@user/archetech)
[19:24:45] <raster> the only other possible win is software rendering where a client can render directly to a drm buffer and swap that directly avoiding a copy. but you're software rendering so you already have other much better possible paths for speedups. at least last i knew toolkits aren't using drm buffers for software rendering anyway (well efl does if it can - someone correct me on gtk/qt - i believe they just uses shm which then 
[19:24:45] <raster> equates to the same path/pipeline as mit-shm+xshmputimage effectively)
[19:25:10] <raster> denisse: that's not a performance thing. :)
[19:25:29] <denisse> raster: I didn't say it's a performance thing.
[19:25:30] <raster> and that would come under another kind of glitch.
[19:25:52] <raster> petrj: well petrj was asking about performance... :)
[19:26:09] <BrainDamage> tcl/tk over remote forwarding had somehow acceptable performance
[19:26:10] <raster> wl is more about removing glitches. for performance it really doesn't do a lot
[19:26:29] <BrainDamage> because it was sending drawing primitives instead of frames
[19:26:43] <raster> thats how x11 works
[19:27:11] <raster> well core drawing is done by sending "draw line" "draw rect" "draw arc" "draw this string with this font"
[19:27:15] <BrainDamage> except motif no other toolkit uses those anymore
[19:27:45] <raster> more modern toolkits now do so much more complex thigns they are often resorting to the "draw this pixel image" and they prepare the pixels int he client with software as the x primitives are too limited or often slower than using the cpu to do it (locally)
[19:28:02] <BrainDamage> yup
[19:28:04] <raster> and thus now for modern drawing pipelines this ends up pushing a lot fo uncompressed pixels down the network thus being pretty slow.
[19:28:50] <BrainDamage> mmm, now I wonder if svg could be used as streaming protocol for a gui toolkit

[19:29:11] <raster> i gave up on any core drawing in x decades ago. except for simple xopyarea (from window to window or pixmap to window - or xfillarea solid regions) ... doing it yourself in your own src with mmx/sse/neon etc. was almost always faster (often many times faster).
[19:29:13] <BrainDamage> gzipped on the fly ofc

[19:29:44] <raster> the casualty of all of this was remote display perf which tbh 99% of the time no one cared about, so you optimized for the 99% case. not the 1% remote use case.
[19:30:11] <raster> and there are better technolgies for remote display of lots of pixels like vnc/nx etc. which allow lossy compression

[19:32:40] <raster> wayland gives up on remote display in the display system itself - it's kind of a waste to spec it there. you spec a local display protocol and then leave remote display to another dedicated protocol like vnc etc. - the idea would be that your compositor and clients use e.g. vnc to transport input/output, not wl protocol. ... this requires both compositors to agree on some protocol and client and toolkits to also agree 
[19:32:40] <raster> to use this too. it doesn't even have to be in the compositor. a local client can act as the local proxy for remote clients - and at the remote end a specific "remote display" compositor can act like a vfb compositor to proxy the results of clients etc.c via this protocol (e.g. vnc).
[19:33:19] *** Joins: jdarnold (~jdarn@pool-71-174-70-228.bstnma.fios.verizon.net)
[19:33:33] <raster> you COULD try a higher level protocol - like at the draw level... but these days perhaps it'd make more sense to transport a scene graph and changes in the scene graph and not draw commands.

[22:02:52] <alzgh> HI, I'm on an Ubuntu focal, but I'd like to checkout Arch both because there is so much talk about it and also because I think it will help improve my linux abilities. Unfortunately, I don't have a spare pc to test it on and I don't want to just switch fully as I need to do my daily routine. What is the best way for me to setup Arch? Can I run it
[22:02:52] <alzgh> on virtual box? docker? what way gives me the closest experience to real Arch considering my limited options? TL;DR: best option to test Arch with no spare pc?

[22:03:45] <alzgh> damn no is a person and I tagged them by mistake, sorry

[22:05:35] <tusko> alzgh, install arch on a small, seperate partition
[22:05:36] <dub_a> Before I made the switch going through the installer on kvm gave me a lot of confidence. I would start there
[22:05:39] <denisse> You can also dual boot and have Arch and Ubuntu installed in the same machine.
[22:05:49] <nifl> seems that qemu/kvm is more often goes with problem than  arch

[22:08:38] <tusko> why all the docker hate? srs I know a lot of people who swear by docker, but they aren really the most knowledgeable people tbh
[22:08:41] <grawity> dunno, I like vbox because its UI is nowhere near as tedious as e.g. virt-manager
[22:08:58] <grawity> though from the technical side maybe qemu/kvm would be better in some ways
