[14:58:33] <teh_f4ll3n> should I get a Framework?
[14:59:40] <Oliber> probably
[14:59:49] <teh_f4ll3n> https://frame.work/
[15:01:03] <Oliber> I saw Linus and Rossmann's reviews of those, i'd really like to see that company work
[15:01:48] <CptLuxx> hm
[15:01:50] <CptLuxx> looks nice
[15:04:11] <Oliber> best bang for buck? probably not, the usb-c modules are a nice idea but not sure how often you'd actually swap them, the ability to repair and upgrade is 10/10, i'm not a big laptop user so i don't know how often you'd be likely to need to actually leverage the repair aspect
[15:04:30] <teh_f4ll3n> hmm... Butterfingers and New York Asshole reviewed them?
[15:04:38] <Oliber> yep
[15:04:41] * teh_f4ll3n runs off to youtube
[15:04:56] <Oliber> Butterfingers invested $250k in them
[15:05:36] <teh_f4ll3n> good for him. I really do hope they succeed
[15:06:50] <teh_f4ll3n> the only USB-C device I have is a webcam which I don't use :D
[15:07:16] <Oliber> if i had need for a laptop and i wouldn't be stung for a massive import duty for a framework, it'd be top of my list
[15:08:30] <teh_f4ll3n> a friend of mine is going to yankeestan to visit his in-laws. might ship it to theirs for him to bring it back
[15:08:39] <teh_f4ll3n> decisions-decisions..
[15:10:53] <Oliber> all the optional port modules use a usb-c connector to connect to the board, so if you want the HDMI module - it's physically connected by USB-C at the back
[15:11:56] <Oliber> which could be interesting for making your own modules for whatever weird shit you can get with a usb-c for the host side
