[01:36:59] <kenaryn> Hello, regarding to settings like content.media.audio_capture (with default value 'ask'), are the others value 'True/False' or 'yes/no' please?
[01:37:43] <triallax[m]> Both seem to work.
[01:38:33] <triallax[m]> Are you speaking about the Python cofig file or changing the setting's value in-browser/
[01:38:35] <triallax[m]> ?
[01:38:38] <kenaryn> Allright, I'll stick to boolean value as it is more close to programming languages.
[01:39:06] <kenaryn> The Python config file would be nice.
[01:39:58] <kenaryn> As the settings webpage is more of a preview/intro/tutorial but less maintenable.
[01:40:38] <triallax[m]> To be clear, I was talking about using `:set content.media.audio_capture true` or something like that, not the settings webpage.
[01:41:12] <kenaryn> I'll try 'c.content.media.audio_capture = True' . Thank you :)
[01:41:32] <triallax[m]> I'm pretty sure that'll work, the one I'm not sure about is setting it to a string of "yes" or "no"
[01:42:43] <kenaryn> yes/no is suggested when a notification is displayed but I'll take the boolean value as a primeval solution.
[01:43:23] <triallax[m]> yes/no should work in the browser, but I have no idea about Python.
[01:43:51] <kenaryn> On a side note, do you know how to save the color theme of GVIM? Each time I edit the config python file, I'll stuck with default editor'settings.
[01:43:51] <triallax[m]> In fact, 1/0, True/False, true/false, and yes/no all seem to work.
[01:44:00] <kenaryn> Allright :)
[01:44:20] <triallax[m]> Hmm, I don't use gvim, but doesn't it have a config file?
[01:44:55] <kenaryn> You mean I can use nvim instead? How can I proceed?
[01:45:55] <triallax[m]> Sorry, I didn't understand you.
[01:47:40] <triallax[m]> Why do you mention nvim?
[01:47:53] <kenaryn> When a type ':config-edit' it opens the settings with GVIM
[01:48:17] <triallax[m]> Does that have anything to do with nvim?
[01:48:31] <kenaryn> But you said that you do not use it, so that may imply there is a way to change the text editor used to configure python qutebrowser'settings?
[01:48:46] <triallax[m]> Ah, gotcha.
[01:48:58] <kenaryn> ^^
[01:49:10] <triallax[m]> Well, I don't use `:config-edit` myself, but you can indeed customize the editor used in Qutebrowser.
[01:49:42] <triallax[m]> It's `c.editor.command`.

[01:52:42] *** Joins: jtgd (~jtgd@user/jtgd)
[01:53:14] <triallax[m]> Well, without the `c.` if you're using `:set`, I copied that from my config file.

[01:56:10] <kenaryn> did'nt work :(
[01:57:33] <triallax[m]> What OS do you use?
[01:57:41] <kenaryn> voidLinux
[01:57:43] <triallax[m]> Also, how did you set the value?
[01:57:47] <triallax[m]> Oh, another Void Linux user!
[01:58:24] <kenaryn> curl -F'file=/home/aurele/Downloads/nvim_editor_command.png' https://0x0.st
[01:58:28] <kenaryn> fuck
[01:59:00] <triallax[m]> Classic.
[01:59:18] <triallax[m]> I'll let you know that I once posted my hard drive password to IRC.
[02:00:09] <kenaryn> The command returns and error 400 :/
[02:00:42] <triallax[m]> You forgot the @ before the file path.
[02:00:43] <triallax[m]> curl -F'file=@PATH' https://0x0.st
[02:01:20] <triallax[m]> Though I think I usually get a segfault when I forget it...
[02:01:21] <kenaryn> https://0x0.st/oNXS.png
[02:01:35] <kenaryn> Yep, thanks :)
[02:01:46] <triallax[m]> You probably need to launch it in a terminal or something.
[02:01:58] <triallax[m]> What terminal do you use?
[02:02:23] <kenaryn> zsh/oh-my-zsh
[02:02:29] <kenaryn> no multiplexer.
[02:02:42] <triallax[m]> I mean your terminal emulator.
[02:02:49] <triallax[m]> i.e. GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, etc.
[02:03:54] <kenaryn> Ah you mean my desktop environment, it is xfce4-terminal
[02:04:33] <kenaryn> I merely replaced 'gvim' with 'nvim' but qutebrowser doesn't seem to like the default parameters for another text editor.
[02:04:57] <triallax[m]> I think it has to do with the fact that gVim launches in its own window, whereas Neovim does not.
[02:05:07] <triallax[m]> I recall getting a similar issue when trying to use Neovim in Qutebrowser.
[02:05:21] <kenaryn> Nice catch, how did you manage?
[02:05:43] <triallax[m]> Well, I didn't, because I just didn't care enough. Lol
[02:05:59] <triallax[m]> Although I'm pretty sure launching it in the terminal is sufficient.
[02:06:29] <kenaryn> now I'm stuck, I cannot load ':config-edit' I need to look for the .py file.
[02:06:44] <triallax[m]> It's in `~/.config/qutebrowser/config.py` probably.
[02:07:07] <triallax[m]> https://docs.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal/command-line
[02:07:15] <triallax[m]> I think the `-x` argument is what we want here.
[02:07:48] <triallax[m]> Can you try running `xfce4-terminal -x echo test` in your shell and seeing if it works?
[02:08:55] <kenaryn> I'll do it right away.
[02:09:42] <triallax[m]> It's either that or `-e`.
[02:10:18] <triallax[m]> Actually, no, I think it's `-e`.
[02:11:17] <kenaryn> my IRC client just twinkled but that's it.
[02:11:28] <triallax[m]> Then yeah, it should be `-e`.
[02:11:50] <kenaryn> '-e' returns "unknow option test"
[02:12:08] <triallax[m]> Then `xfce4-terminal -x "echo test"`?
[02:12:28] <triallax[m]> Sorry, no.
[02:12:33] <triallax[m]> `xfce4-terminal -e "echo test"`
[02:12:40] <kenaryn> xfce4-terminal -e test returns 0 exit code but just make the irc terminal client twinkle a very brief instant.
[02:12:53] <kenaryn> same with -x option.
[02:12:53] <triallax[m]> Well, test is a command.
[02:13:01] <kenaryn> really?
[02:13:10] <triallax[m]> Yeah, it's used to evaluate conditions.
[02:13:20] <triallax[m]> It's also known as `[`.
[02:13:41] <triallax[m]> Anyway, tried my latest suggestion?
[02:13:43] <kenaryn> Thanks, did not know about that.
[02:15:08] <kenaryn> Yes, tried it. Something may happened with the other terminal window (the IRC client), a sparkle then nothing. Like it was trying to refresh the process related to terminal window or something.
[02:15:42] <triallax[m]> Then `xfce4-terminal -e nvim`?
[02:16:12] <triallax[m]> Damn, if only I wasn't too lazy to test all this on my other machine which does happen to have XFCE installed.
[02:16:19] <kenaryn> Maybe the setting needs "exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator" before the other values.
[02:17:13] <kenaryn> Nice, xfce4-terminal -e nvim started the text editor from scratch
[02:17:34] <triallax[m]> Good, I was about to give up and launch the machine.
[02:17:57] <triallax[m]> Does it work if you do `xfce4-terminal -e "nvim test.txt"`?
[02:18:30] <kenaryn> I'll try but don't manage to copy paste from qutebrowser to another application.
[02:18:44] <kenaryn> That's really irritating.
[02:19:08] <triallax[m]> I think there's something called caret mode where you can do that?
[02:20:17] <kenaryn> How do you yank/put something from qutebrowser to your IRC client?
[02:21:26] <triallax[m]> Frankly, I'm still not sure how to do that well yet.
[02:21:34] <triallax[m]> I just select with my mouse and copy the selection.
[02:22:08] <triallax[m]> Ooh, I figured it out.
[02:22:58] <kenaryn> Don't bother, I'll try the setting.
[02:22:59] <triallax[m]> https://teddit.namazso.eu/r/qutebrowser/comments/sfwozx/how_do_i_copy_selected_text_to_my_clipboard/
[02:25:23] <kenaryn> something I did'nt have time to read must be integer or slices, not tuples
[02:25:43] <kenaryn> ":process" returns success so the error message is now unreachable :/
[02:26:06] <triallax[m]> Can you paste the line where you set `editor.command`?
[02:26:54] <kenaryn> did it consider 'xfce4-terminal -e nvim' first argument a tuple due to the blank characters?
[02:27:12] <kenaryn> c.editor.command ["xfce4-terminal -e nvim", "-f", "{file}", "-c", "normal {line}G{column0}l"]
[02:27:28] <triallax[m]> Did you forget the `=` sign?
[02:27:42] <kenaryn> Nope, there is not.
[02:28:04] <kenaryn> Damn it, apologies.
[02:28:05] <triallax[m]> Well, there should be one after c.editor.command
[02:28:26] *** Quits: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:29:56] <triallax[m]> Also, I think it should be like this:
[02:29:59] <triallax[m]> c.editor.command = ["xfce4-terminal", "-e", "nvim -f {file} -c normal {line}G{column0}l"]
[02:30:14] <kenaryn> editor did not start due to 'execvp: no such file or directory'
[02:30:26] <triallax[m]> Yeah, that's what I'd expect.
[02:30:46] *** Quits: emagex (~user@user/emagex) (Quit: ERC (IRC client for Emacs 27.1))
[02:30:57] <triallax[m]> It's looking for an "xfce4-terminal -e nvim" command, but you mean "xfce4-terminal" only.
[02:31:00] <kenaryn> I'll try with the -c command
[02:31:08] <triallax[m]> What I sent above should work.
[02:31:18] <triallax[m]> No, that won't work.
[02:31:24] <kenaryn> Allright, did not see it.
[02:31:43] <triallax[m]> If you're typing manually, pay attention to the quotes.
[02:32:10] <kenaryn> Roger that.
[02:34:37] <triallax[m]> Also, why the `-f` option passed to `nvim`? I don't see that in `man nvim`.
[02:35:26] <kenaryn> nvim is now launched when typing "config-edit" but with eror E471: Arfument required
[02:35:41] <triallax[m]> Try removing `-f`.
[02:36:38] <kenaryn> Yes I'll try without the 'f' but the dash is required between nvim and the file used as an argument
[02:36:42] <triallax[m]> Actually, try this one:
[02:36:43] <triallax[m]> c.editor.command = ["xfce4-terminal", "-e", "nvim {file} -c 'normal {line}G{column0}l'"]
[02:36:53] <kenaryn> Allright.
[02:37:02] <kenaryn> Thanks for your patience.
[02:37:06] <triallax[m]> Really? I always just type `nvim foo.txt` and it works.
[02:37:34] <triallax[m]> You're welcome.
[02:38:45] <kenaryn> I tried with and without the dash 
[02:39:00] <kenaryn> But to no avail, the argument required error still occured.
[02:39:21] <triallax[m]> With the line I last sent?
[02:39:34] <triallax[m]> Mind sending the error?
[02:40:56] <kenaryn> Error detected while processing command line:
[02:40:57] <kenaryn> E471: Argument required
[02:41:57] <triallax[m]> Screenshot of `:process` again please?
[02:42:49] <kenaryn> Allright, you're the champion.
[02:43:10] <kenaryn> You managed it! I didn't see you add 2 singles quotes for the final argument.
[02:43:34] <kenaryn> Congratulations, you earned the right to waste 1h of your life for a stranger lol.
[02:43:57] <triallax[m]> Haha, so it works now?
[02:45:10] <kenaryn> Yes, flawlessly :)
[02:45:29] <triallax[m]> Aight, greaet.
[02:45:35] <kenaryn> It shall be added on a FAQ or wiki.
[02:45:40] <kenaryn> Thank you again.
[02:46:09] <triallax[m]> You're welcome.
[02:46:32] <triallax[m]> We might've gotten this solved sooner if I went up and tried it myself, but no way am I doing this at 2 AM.
[02:50:25] <kenaryn> Yes, there was no rush to solve that matter.
[02:50:35] <kenaryn> With your timezone, you're in eastern europe?
[02:50:59] <triallax[m]> If I were in Europe, you'd be right.
[02:52:10] <kenaryn> Lybia?
[02:53:21] <triallax[m]> No, and according to Wikipedia it uses UTC+2, one hour behind me.
[02:53:29] <triallax[m]> Either way, I'd prefer not to reveal my exact location. :)
[02:53:37] <kenaryn> You're right.
[02:53:50] <kenaryn> I'm on the moon for my part so let's keep it secret.
[02:54:29] <triallax[m]> Haha
[02:54:31] <kenaryn> I have to go, you're a good guy, keep up the good work and see you on #voidlinux or #qutebrowser.
[02:55:16] <triallax[m]> I'm not in #voidlinux at the moment, though I pop in there to ask a question occasionally.

[17:18:56] <The-Compiler> triallax[m]: if you e.g. define your base tempdir to contain spaces, probably - but spaces have no special meaning if no shell is involved
[17:19:19] <triallax[m]> Well, when they're getting passed to `xfce4-terminal`, won't they?
[17:19:22] <The-Compiler> oh, unless xfce4-terminal splits on spaces I suppose
[17:19:32] <triallax[m]> Which it does I believe.
[17:19:49] <The-Compiler> yeah, then technically speaking I guess that should be '{file}'
[17:20:04] <triallax[m]> Well, unless the path also contains a single quote too.
[17:20:05] <triallax[m]> Lol
[17:20:12] <The-Compiler> yeah
[17:20:24] <The-Compiler> but that's probably even less likely than it containing spaces, I suppos
[17:20:26] <The-Compiler> +e
[17:20:32] <triallax[m]> The most foolproof solution I can think of is having an external script that is passed the path and other stuff, and which then launches xfce4-terminal.

[17:21:10] <The-Compiler> but that's surprisingly difficult to do on Linux
[17:23:37] <triallax[m]> Well, kenaryn, do check out the above conversation.
[17:23:45] <The-Compiler> they are gone
[17:23:54] <The-Compiler> I will postpone a message
[17:23:58] <triallax[m]> Huh, doesn't look like that on Marix.
[17:24:01] <triallax[m]> Matrix*
[17:25:12] <The-Compiler> 00:26 <- kenaryn (~aurele@89-88-44-27.abo.bbox.fr) has quit (Quit: leaving)
[17:25:19] <The-Compiler> blame matrix then :p
[17:25:20] <ktprograms> triallax[m]: I think he uses a postpone plugin for WeeChat
[17:25:27] <The-Compiler> yes I do
[17:25:44] <triallax[m]> One more reason for me to move to IRC.
[17:26:31] <The-Compiler> I actually was thinking about moving to Matrix instead of Telegram for some stuff
[17:26:48] <ktprograms> triallax[m]: Does matrix not show users joining/leaving?
[17:26:50] <The-Compiler> but I hope the rest of it isn't as unreliable as the IRC bridge seems to be sometimes
[17:27:02] <triallax[m]> ktprograms: it does, but I don't nkow why it didn't her.e
[17:27:36] <triallax[m]> I only use Matrix for IRC really, but what little else I use it for it works fine.

[20:17:57] <henko> or i could use a greasemonkey script
[20:18:14] <henko> how do i get started with interceptor api
[20:18:17] <triallax[m]> Yeah, that works too.
[20:18:24] <triallax[m]> Give me a minute.

[20:18:51] *** Joins: bdju (~bard@user/bdju)
[20:24:04] <Earnest> greasemonkey isn't nice for this
[20:24:07] <Earnest> As it has to poll
[20:24:36] <triallax[m]> It does?
[20:24:43] <Earnest> henko: It's relatively straight forward: https://0x0.st/ihs0.bin (python), you can probably improve this a lot as well
[20:24:47] <triallax[m]> Can't it change the domain of the current page?
[20:25:03] <Earnest> triallax[m]: not without polling last I looked
[20:25:17] <triallax[m]> Hmm, I don't understand why it would need polling.
[20:25:35] <triallax[m]> Just have a script that runs on a specific domain, and have `document.location = 'https://example.com'` in it or something.
[20:25:41] <Earnest> Because race
[20:25:57] <triallax[m]> What is it racing with?
[20:26:26] <Earnest> The script itself and the page load
[20:26:45] <triallax[m]> Ah, so you mean that part of the page might load before the script executes, right?
[20:27:52] <Earnest> Yes, although it might be possible now using the @qute-js-world jseval header bit which can select
[20:33:04] <triallax[m]> Hmm, I do use that for my Greasemonkey scripts, so that they can execute even when I disabled JS for the website.
[20:33:37] <Earnest> Yeah
[20:34:21] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@91.114.49.10) (Quit: Bin weg.)
[20:35:48] <Earnest> triallax[m]: In a sense the @match stuff should mean the script itself can only possibly be run after the domain is definately known
[20:36:25] <triallax[m]> Gotcha.
[20:36:28] <Earnest> The only difference left then is that the page loads before being redirected while the interceptor api can do this before the page is loaded
[20:37:59] <triallax[m]> By the way, why the `if url != request.request_url.toString():` bit?
[20:38:46] <triallax[m]> Wait, are you the one whom I had a small chat with on GitHub a week ago?

[21:45:14] <Earnest> triallax[m]: This is quite old and I had issues where it was attempting to redirect urls that had already been "fixed", especially for ones which don't change the hostname
[21:46:07] <Earnest> I haven't really changed this for 2 years or so
[21:47:19] <Earnest> And so I'm sure there are better ways to manage the logic or even just use of python itself
