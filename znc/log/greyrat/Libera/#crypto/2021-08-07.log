[00:13:44] <jbis> I understand neither should be used for password hashing due to speed, but in terms of other attacks, is md5 any worse than sha1?
[00:13:53] <wasamasa> yes
[00:14:10] <wasamasa> sha1 attacks need a lot more power than md5
[00:14:41] <wasamasa> md5 is what shows up in jeopardy CTFs, not sha1, lol
[00:14:53] <riv> yes
[00:15:10] <riv> md5 was broken much before sha1

[00:17:37] <jbis> And apparently the md5 one isn't theoretical and not practical

[00:17:49] <jbis> https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/41865/87286
[00:18:05] <riv> md5 collision was found in 1996, sha1 collision in 2017
[00:18:16] <ms7821> md5 is much simpler than sha1
[00:18:29] <jbis> Link?
[00:18:39] <ms7821> don't compare an attack on reduced sha1 with full md5
[00:18:39] <jbis> Oh
[00:18:47] <jbis> Collisions
[00:18:57] <jbis> Collision attack is much different than preimage
[00:19:03] <jbis> I think preimage is more relevant here
[00:19:09] <ms7821> where?
[00:19:12] <riv> but basically I think sha1 is stronger than md5
[00:19:33] <riv> of course both are broken... so it doesn;t really matter

[00:20:41] <jbis> in terms of passwords
[00:20:50] <jbis> collision attack doesn't really matter, right?
[00:21:05] <ms7821> brute force _really_ matters though
[00:21:10] <ms7821> and md5 is much faster than sha1
[00:21:26] <riv> if you have a file of hashed passwords, the md5 ones will be easier to crack
[00:21:28] <jbis> yes, meant besides speed
[00:21:39] <ms7821> what do you mean then?
[00:21:53] <ms7821> so far it sounds like you're trying to get us to say md5 is better, and it's not
[00:22:22] <jbis> No, I am trying to understand if (other than speed) there is much of a difference between using md5 and sha1 for passwords
[00:22:34] <ms7821> don't use either for passwords, ever
[00:22:40] *** Joins: caveman (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[00:22:44] <jbis> Yes, I know
[00:22:46] <danieldg> if the password has lots of entropy you're fine, but generally they don't
[00:22:52] <jbis> Theoretical 
[00:23:05] <danieldg> yes, theoretical passwords often have lots of entropy
[00:23:07] <riv> "I am trying to understand if (other than speed) there is much of a difference between using md5 and sha1 for passwords" <- I think I answered this?
[00:23:41] <jbis> riv: Yes. Going back to what you said. Is collision attack very relevant here?
[00:23:50] <jbis> I thought preimage more important
[00:24:05] <jbis> actually better question
[00:24:09] <danieldg> for passwords collision is unimportant
[00:24:26] <riv> Yes <- ok great!
[00:24:31] <jbis> is md5 any more susceptible to preimage attack than sha1 ?
[00:24:41] <danieldg> it's shorter
[00:25:23] <danieldg> 128 vs 160, so 80-64 => 2^16 times more susceptible
[00:25:35] <danieldg> er, ignore that ^^
[00:25:47] <danieldg> just 2^32 times more
[00:26:25] <ms7821> and both *should* be impractical, but when you have an algorithm that's already been broken it's quite likely someone will find other ways to break it
[00:27:29] <danieldg> afaik there are no public preimage speed improvements though
[00:28:40] <ms7821> there's https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/440.pdf, which is against a reduced version
[00:29:25] <ms7821> compare with e.g. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70500-0_21
[00:29:34] <ms7821> but these things are hard to compare directly

[21:31:40] <LTCD> Hey. In the Introduction to Modern Cryptography 2nd edition by Katz and Lindell on PDF page 33/598 they show a simple sigma example. I fail to understand what the 0.065 means and how p_i^(2) which represents plaintext letter frequency, such as e being 12.7%, could approximately equal 0.065 when squared.

[21:36:48] <yawkat> i dont see the problem? it's a sum
[21:37:03] <ms7821> what bit don't you understand? the summing or the multiplying?
[21:37:11] <ms7821> 0.127*0.127=0.016129
[21:37:22] <LTCD> Well, according to the eratta the chart is wrong, o should be 7.5 not 1.5 which might have confused me.
[21:37:52] <LTCD> Why did you choose to multiply 0.127 by itself?
[21:38:31] <LTCD> Also, ms7821 your 0.0161 seems smaller than their 0.065
[21:38:44] <ms7821> because the statistic they're calculating is based on summing p_i^2
[21:38:59] <ldm> yeah
[21:39:09] <ms7821> if the exact value of o has confused you but summing hasn't, I don't really know how to help
[21:39:09] <ldm> 0.0161 is p_i² for one value of i
[21:39:52] <ldm> the order is important LTCD: for each value of p_i, it's squared first, _then_ added to the sum
[21:40:07] <ldm> so since all values of p_i are less than 1, squaring them will make them smaller
[21:40:42] <LTCD> I got the o value wrong since I did not read the eratta, but is this what you are saying: 8.2^2 + 1.5^2 + 2.8^2 + 4.3^2 + 12.7^2 + 2.2^2 + 2.0^2 + 6.1^2 + 7.0^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.8^2 + 4.0^2 + 2.4^2 + 6.7^2 + 1.5^2 + 1.9^2 + 0.1^2 + 6.0^2 + 6.3^2 + 9.1^2 + 2.8^2 + 1.0^2 + 2.4^2 + 0.2^2 + 2.0^2 + 0.1^2
[21:40:42] <LTCD> = 602.51
[21:40:44] <ldm> the values of p_i sum to 1.0 since they are probabilities, so we should expect that the sum of p_i² should be less than one
[21:40:50] <ldm> ah no
[21:40:51] <ms7821> no, they're percentages
[21:40:53] <ldm> ^
[21:40:58] <LTCD> = 602.51
[21:40:58] <LTCD>  <--- This might have been chopped off.
[21:41:02] <ms7821> so 0.127 instead of 12.7
[21:41:05] <ldm> "
[21:41:29] <LTCD> I am not really getting it sorry. 
[21:41:51] <yawkat> % is mathspeak for x 0.01
[21:42:21] <LTCD> Are you saying if you square the probability of plaintext letter e which is 12.7 you convert it into 0.127 and then square 0.127?
[21:42:27] <ldm> yes
[21:42:36] <yawkat> the probability is 12.7%, not 12.7
[21:42:39] <ldm> well, the *percentage* of e is 12.7%
[21:42:42] <ldm> which is 0.127
[21:42:56] <LTCD> 0.127 ^ 2 = 0.016129 which is miles away from 0.065 though...
[21:43:11] <yawkat> yes, because then you have to do the sum...
[21:43:21] <LTCD> The sum of every letter yawkat ?
[21:43:28] <yawkat> just like you did above
[21:43:35] <LTCD> Right, let me see.
[21:44:09] <yawkat> this also explains why your value is off by a factor of exactly 100*100, after correcting the erratum for 'o'.
[21:44:11] <LTCD> *Typing up my notes just a minute*
[21:46:39] <LTCD> (8.2/100)^2 + (1.5/100)^2 + (2.8/100)^2 + (4.3/100)^2 + (12.7/100)^2 + (2.2/100)^2 + (2.0/100)^2 + (6.1/100)^2 + (7.0/100)^2 + (0.2/100)^2 + (0.8/100)^2 + (4.0/100)^2 + (2.4/100)^2 + (6.7/100)^2 + (7.5/100)^2 + (1.9/100)^2 + (0.1/100)^2 + (6.0/100)^2 + (6.3/100)^2 + (9.1/100)^2 + (2.8/100)^2 + (1.0/100)^2 + (2.4/100)^2 + (0.2/100)^2 + (2.0/100)^2 +
[21:46:39] <LTCD> (0.1/100)^2
[21:46:40] <LTCD>  = 0.065
[21:47:00] <ms7821> looks about right
[21:47:02] *** Joins: aleck (~aleck@user/aleck)
[21:47:27] <LTCD> My only question is what is so special about that number, just that it is the answer? I kind of need to know it's importance before I go onto the next sigma a little down the page.
[21:48:16] <riv> btw
[21:48:29] <yawkat> well, it says further below.
[21:48:32] <riv> (x/100)^2 + ... = (x^2 + ...)/100^2

[21:48:55] <riv> just a time save for future
[21:49:09] <ms7821> it's really just a measure of the relative frequencies of letters. A sum is unordered, so you can picture the letter frequency graph in descending order. This statistic then tells you roughly the ratios between the frequencies

[21:50:46] <LTCD> In the next sigma further down, I understand I pick j=0 and then try i=0, ..., i=25 to see if p_i * q_i + j = 0.065 I think?

[22:00:14] <LTCD> ms7821 So it's it's not aprox 0.065 after summing 0 to 25, then I move onto the next value in j? 
[22:00:50] <ms7821> yeah, or maybe you do it for all j values, sort them, and see which ones are closest
[22:02:13] <LTCD> That is what confused me, I am new to maths, but this is like a loop within a loop. Like j=0 then loop i=0 to 25, after j++.
[22:02:27] <ms7821> yeh
[22:02:36] <LTCD> Thank you guys and gals so much, really.
[22:04:30] <ms7821> maybe clearer to imagine this measure sum as a function, e.g. "def calc_magic_number(freqs, offset=0): return sum([(freq[c + offset) % 26]^2 for i in range(26)])
[22:05:47] <ms7821> and after calling calc_magic_number(english_freqs), you call it on the ciphertext freqs, for j in range(26)
[22:07:07] <ms7821> oops, "freqs[(i", not "freq[c". programming in irc is a bad idea
[22:07:47] <LTCD> Wait, so in the book it is telling me to do this twice, once with normal English distribution, and then with the ciphertext distribution, because if ciphertext letter H is the most frequent it is likely letter e?
[22:08:20] <ms7821> effectively, yeah. Or rather, the offset that gives you the measure closest to english is probably right
[22:08:31] <LTCD> For the moment, I just want to follow the book to pass this exam, my next course will cover the practical side of this. So is that what the book was saying with their formula?

[22:10:04] <LTCD> I thought in the book it said to multiply plaintext letter p_i with q_(i+j) for i=0 to 25, then j++ and repeat again, until we find the key because output is 0.065. I had no idea the book wanted me to print out write out two tables...
[22:10:39] <ms7821> oh hang on, I might have missed out a bit in my code. Ignore that :P
[22:12:02] <ms7821> yeah, you do multiply against the english frequencies, sorry
[22:12:07] <LTCD> Ohhhh phew
[22:12:19] <ms7821> I closed the book and then immediately forgot what it was saying
[22:12:33] <LTCD> I do appreciate your input though, but for now I am trapped by the educational system to just do what the professor wants.
[22:13:19] <LTCD> I do like your approach though, because the most common English letter e will match the most common ciphertext letter H (where H is just a random example).
[22:13:27] <LTCD> Well, that is what I think you were saying.
