[00:03:29] <tirnanog> Very_Confused_Pe: I think you're confusing filesystem roots with drives. whether the root directory of a given filesystem should be root-owned depends on the intent.
[00:03:30] <HimeHaieto> tirnanog: in this case, it looks like simply replacing the "_" with "1" makes it apply correctly (and produce the same patch by turning around with `diff -u` again), but this feels wrong at best lol

[00:13:53] <StrangelyTyped> I'm hoping to start daily driving linux on my Dell Inspiron 5567 but i'm having audio issues. It works but it sounds terrible through the built-in speakers and there's nothing below 200hz, though fine through headphones. Tried on ubuntu/debian/fedora so far, all the same. Looks like i'm not the first with [this
[00:13:53] <StrangelyTyped> issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/1741546) but they don't seem to have got anywhere. I'm pretty linux competent but I've never been anywhere near the audio stack before so I'm pretty out of my depth here so looking for help and advice as to how to try and debug this.
[00:14:21] <HimeHaieto> pierino: like you suggested, I think it really comes down much more to just cvs being what you know and are familiar with, then git not being able to work the way you want/need

[00:20:14] <tirnanog> ntfs is a nuisance in linux. you have to synthesize the permissions by using mount options instead.
[00:20:52] <mrfb> advice, if you need a common windows/linux filesystem, use extfat instead
[00:21:14] <hexnewbie> That's the simpler alternative (compared to user mapping files), but removable filesystems with permissions are always an issue

[00:38:27] <rbox> don't be a fool, wrap your app
[00:38:53] <StrangelyTyped> I'm hoping to start daily driving linux on my Dell Inspiron 5567 but i'm having audio issues. It works but it sounds terrible through the built-in speakers and there's nothing below 200hz, though fine through headphones. Tried on ubuntu/debian/fedora so far, all the same. Looks like i'm not the first with [this
[00:38:53] <StrangelyTyped> issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/1741546) but they don't seem to have got anywhere. I'm pretty linux competent but I've never been anywhere near the audio stack before so I'm pretty out of my depth here so looking for help and advice as to how to start debugging this.
[00:39:01] <Gaboradon> mrfb: It's a desktop GUI app and I always launch it manually - tirnanog: Yes I found the .desktop ... so I then execute this desktop file then, seems better yes than running the app directly (I've seen differences running bins directly in Konsole)

[00:40:52] *** Joins: andbartol (~andbartol@user/Bartol)

[00:42:21] <HimeHaieto> gaboradon: I think rbox might have been making a bit of a joke

[00:42:48] <tirnanog> .desktop files can specify what needs to be executed.
[00:43:23] <tirnanog> therefore, you would need to be able to override the vendor-provided .desktop file for this application.
[00:43:32] <tirnanog> and that's what ~/.local/share/applications can be used for.

[02:09:01] <kulak> the company I work for uses k8s.  we are a platform provider based on k8s.  And I know 1st hand how complicate this technology is, because I have to code for it.  I like orchestration capabilities of k8s, but don't like the complexity.  So, for my personal projects I'd like to consider nomad.  not for work, because work is 100% in into k8s.

[05:01:36] <HimeHaieto> like I said, you seem to have done something much bigger or otherwise with much more serious implications somewhere along the way, and I don't know what all that might have been

[05:02:42] <Very_Confused_Ag> I uninstalled another kernel that I installed too, but that was 5.15.10 and was basically having same issue aswell
[05:02:44] <nomagno> I could map a physical 1MB R/W thingy 3KBs at a time to the VM's I/O, with a few bits for the section of the drive to be read...

[05:03:41] <HimeHaieto> very_confused_ag: I don't know/recall what button(s) to use and the internet is giving conflicting answers, but there should be some button you can press/hold during boot to get to a grub menu/shell even if you normally would skip it
[05:03:55] <FuriousGeorge> Very_Confused_Ag:  that part is working already...  hence my confusion
[05:03:58] <Blondie101010> nomagno:  you seem to be confusing concepts...  large drive and file support has existed for *many* decades, and goes far beyond memory limitations and address space

[08:36:10] <Kremator> the bootx64.efi file is nowhere to be found in my /boot partition

[09:26:31] <zyklotomic> re io_uring, why is that in kernel versions >= 5.4 that you can use a single mmap() to map both the submission and completion queues
[09:26:53] <zyklotomic> i was reading this article, and saw it in the man pages for io_uring as well https://unixism.net/2020/04/io-uring-by-example-part-1-introduction/

[09:39:11] <mlu> pagios: ZFS might be worth it for that in this case if you want to expand the storage / add a bit of redundancy

[09:40:29] <mlu> so it sounds like you do need the features because 50TB does not fit on a single hard disk
[09:40:33] <spyroboy> make sure to use at least double parity. triple parity is likely overkill.
[09:40:42] <pagios> mlu:  i am thinking of putting 100Gb on mountpoint / ext4 for OS and using /data for example on zfs
[09:40:42] <jim> pagios, you should have backups periodically
[09:40:44] <Affliction> Well, you could run ext4 on a RAID

[09:40:54] <mlu> pagios: that's a good plan

[09:41:06] <mlu> pagios: btw, ZFS has excellent support under FreeBSD

I'm really surprised...

[13:57:55] <phogg> if you are creating and rming the same file repeatedly then there is always a narrow window where it doesn't exist
[13:59:14] <phogg> you can reduce the chances of this happening by creating the new copy with a new name and mving it over the old copy when you're ready, but it's better to not depend on the file always being there

[17:54:43] <wyre> tirnanog, I thought the very same, but I've removed the partition/partition table and the filesystem (with wipefs) but when I just create a partition it has already its filesystem
[17:54:51] <wyre> so I guess parted creates it
[17:55:07] <tirnanog> wyre: interesting. I know that parted can create filesystems but it's surprising to me that it would do so for that command.

[18:38:40] <wyre> tirnanog, I've noticed also this for cgdisk
[18:38:43] <tirnanog> some author obviously thought it would be convenient.
[18:38:52] <wyre> when you create a new partition ... you have also to provide this fs-type
[18:38:56] <tirnanog> maybe from the standpoint of "cutting out an additional step" or something like that.
[18:38:58] <tirnanog> I don't like it.
[18:39:03] <tirnanog> it's conflating two different things.
[18:39:08] <wyre> but it doesn't apparently format the partition either!
[18:39:11] <tirnanog> yes.
[18:39:14] <wyre> because I have to use also mkfs ... so ...
[18:39:28] <tirnanog> but when you see fs-type, and know that parted does also have the ability to create filesystems, it's easy to become confused.
[18:39:47] <tirnanog> also, the documentation doesn't appear to explain the mappings between fs-types and the partition types.
[18:40:20] <wyre> tirnanog, sure, that's exactly what you have to choose when using cgdisk, the partition type
[18:40:42] <wyre> which got me usually confused ... because cgdisk doesn't show partition types as fs types ...
[18:40:52] <tirnanog> but that's correct.

[18:47:23] <tirnanog> ah, no.
[18:47:25] <tirnanog> so.
[18:47:35] <wyre> so ... how could specifying ext4 for fs-types will generate an UUID?
[18:47:52] <tirnanog> for dos/mbr partitions, we only neede a two digit hex code to disambiguate the available partition types.
[18:48:18] <tirnanog> for gpt, they changed it so that they keys are full blown UUIDs. it has nothing to do with the UUID that can be contained by a filesystem.
[18:48:23] <tirnanog> the latter is what you saw in lsblk.
[18:48:42] <tirnanog> for example, in gpt, "Linux filesystem" is 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4. always.

[20:27:16] <diaugustdev> Hello everyone, I'm starting development of a .deb package for an open-source project. It's the first time I'm doing this kind of thing, so I have some initial questions. I've already created the .deb package, installed it locally and it's running normally. I don't know if I am generating the key in the right way. I used "gpg --generate-key", added
[20:27:17] <diaugustdev> the information and got the fingerprint with "gpg --fingerprint', then added it to my ppa repository in launchpad. The next step would be to upload my gpg key to the keyserver (https://keyserver.ubuntu.com), when I try to upload my key it says: "bad request". It asks me to export the key with "--export --armor", and I did. Is there any way to send
[20:27:17] <diaugustdev> my key to keyserver via terminal? Are the above steps correct? Thanks
