[02:34:07] <mats1> or more specific chans like ##asm or #osdev
[02:34:13] <fishguts> ajax: like crypto mining and ransomware, to me at least, are code that would take a while to learn about. for instance, you'd have to create an AES and RSA algorithm for the keys, and know how cryptog and networking works. and the nitty gritty details are not something you can find through a search engine as it's highly illegal. you know what i mean?
[02:34:27] <fishguts> but it seems a new ransomware comes out of the woodwork all the time
[02:34:28] <mats1> none of that is illegal
[02:34:31] <ajak> what
[02:34:40] <mats1> it is not a crime to study malware
[02:34:41] <ajak> doing any kind of crypto is not remotely illegal
[02:34:55] <fishguts> it's very illegal what?? ransomware is one of the most illegal malware of all time
[02:35:07] <ajak> you can also just package a miner someone else has made and ship it in your malware
[02:35:32] <ajak> deploying ransomware on someone else is generally illegal, yes
[02:35:39] <ajak> but it's not illegal to learn about it, absolutely not
[02:35:44] <fishguts> maybe im too much of a noob, but for example i can't google 'how to create a ransomware' and get meaningful results yknow?

[03:31:21] <EdFletcher> CaCode: the scanning traffic is all automated, and much of the simple penetration is likely too. if the bots found an easy attack vector they may have just automatically triggered some action against you, unlikely that you're being actively targeted. though some people _really_  dislike pigeons. not sure why though, they're just cosmopolitan doves.
[03:32:12] <CaCode> EdFletcher, I agree the majestic pigeon is beloved by most, but some people just hate beauty

[12:36:45] <Duncan_> I have a question regarding privacy / security: As far as I have read into the subject the following method seems to be the most secure one to protect my private data / passwords: I will use a small netbook computer with only linux on it that's sufficiently secured with hardware / software passwords and never connect this pc to any kind of network or internet via cable / wifi etc.

[12:41:15] <Duncan_> but my question is as follows: sooner or later that linux netbook (or whatever computer type it will be) is going to fail because of planned obsolescence or just some hardware / software error. Which would mean I lose all my private data. Which in turn means I have to back up my data somewhere on at least one other hardware storage device. But what kind of harddisc or usb stick can be sufficiently password protected?

[12:53:57] <shad> every linux distros will propose that at install time, LVM encrypted hard drive. If you don't have that, if someone has access to your laptop, they have access to your harddrive very easily
[12:54:34] <Duncan_> yes I have read about that, shad. thank you for the reminder.
[12:56:32] <shad> there are also fancy encryption schemes with layers, i remember reading about that on /r/netsec but can't remember the name
[12:57:09] <shad> the idea be you have your harddrive encrypted, kneecaps busted, you give a first password, but there could be n more to access to deeper layers of encrypted data
[12:58:06] <Duncan_> well I am not looking for something too professional... I am just trying to find an quick and easy method for a private person to protect his data from scriptkiddies and thieves.
[12:58:06] <ajak> that doesn't make sense
[12:58:12] <ajak> bust the other knee and get another layer
[12:58:26] <shad> ajak: your attacker won't know there's another layer to get to
[12:58:34] <shad> well, that was the theory
[12:58:56] <Duncan_> so you mean layering the encryptions if i get you right
[12:59:17] <shad> Duncan_: full disk encryption from a Linux installation is something very strong already
[12:59:19] <Duncan_> like an encrypted archive inside an encrypted harddrive?
[12:59:42] <Duncan_> ok
[12:59:53] <shad> The thing i was mentionning is just for paranoid, geeks like us that want to have fun, or chinese Uyghurs
[13:00:49] <shad> then, once you have a LVM encrypted hard drive, use a unique password, don't install random stuff, have backups in 3-2-1 fashion, encrypted if you feel the need to
[13:01:09] <shad> can't get much more secure than that
[13:01:28] <Duncan_> well as I said: I don't need the super professional method. It just has to hold of the usual paid IT-guy, Scriptkid and standard criminal / hacker.
[13:02:10] <Duncan_> thank you for your help, shad

[21:25:00] <applegal> what is the most powerful antivirus and lightest in resource for windows 10?
[21:25:14] <B4ckBOne> MS Defender?
[21:26:37] *** Quits: stonkey (~stonkey@user/stonkey) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:27:32] <skill> i'd agree with that. not a bad product at all
[21:27:51] <applegal> because I'm using a virtualization software that will reset windows to its default state after restarting my computer.. so I would prefer to be able to be able to manually update the virus definitions..
[21:27:59] <applegal> do you think I'm doing right
[21:28:07] <applegal> by using a third party anti virus?
[21:28:27] <applegal> because that will completely replace windows defender and will prevent it from updating
[21:31:29] <applegal> what is the worlds most powerful antivirus available on the market?
[21:32:00] <B4ckBOne> brain.exe
[21:32:03] <zoite> unplugging your computer
[21:32:18] <B4ckBOne> But brain.exe is Exclusive.
[21:32:23] <B4ckBOne> Not everyone gets it.
[21:32:42] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[21:33:12] <applegal> thanks for your input B4ckBOne
[21:33:13] <applegal> next
[21:33:22] <skill> applegal: you have to be more specific. Powerful is vague. Overall most anti-virus have the same level of protection (sure, some marginal differences). The rest is on how much resources they need, how much they cost, how well they integrate with the OS.
[21:33:34] <skill> MS Defender is probably the best bet without paying money for it.
[21:33:53] <skill> If you want to pay for the feature so that the AV agent downloads signatures automatically, I suggest you do some market research on that.
[21:33:58] <skill> Different price points.
[21:34:02] <zoite> if you are virtualizing everything maybe you can run any new software through virustotal which uses a number of scanners. I don't think there is a single best application
[21:34:20] <zoite> supply chain attacks are still a concern, though
[21:34:32] <skill> Also, if you're reseting state after reboot. Are you looking for a quick use of Windows then restarting?
[21:34:45] <B4ckBOne> There is that guy on youtube that tests AV Solutions against Malware and Virus samples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoVKBiFJ7wY&list=PLRs8fqjYD5ILw73zeNeEXpwoP9Swk13qD

[21:34:47] <skill> If that's the case, why do you think you need AV? like I said, I think you need to be more specific.
[21:35:02] <B4ckBOne> Might wanna watch a couple of those tests.
[21:35:09] <zoite> there are some bios attacks which could bypass a reset too
[21:35:21] <skill> there are human behind keyboards attack as well
[21:35:24] <skill> question is what's realistic.
[21:35:29] * zoite nods
[21:37:26] <applegal> skill: I think you are making sense.. I guess occasionally I'd like to run a full system scan.. and in virtualization mode I can just restart a computer and get rid of all the malware or virus. I wanted a anti virus because I'd like to stop MS Defender from updating itself like every few mins.
[21:37:33] <B4ckBOne> While you guys are active.
[21:37:47] <applegal> because the updates made were gone once I restart the computer
[21:37:50] <B4ckBOne> mojo.1234.1234.123123123123 Named Pipes for MSEdge are normal or not?
[21:37:53] <applegal> am I making any sense skill

[21:39:10] <applegal> you can only disable it by replacing it with another anti virus
[21:39:24] <skill> applegal: but when windows boots, it'll update its signature. Sure you lose them when you restart, but they updates will be applied

[21:39:47] <skill> applegal: i'm not sure what you're doing :) can't tell if you don't want to have AV or just don't want an up-to-date AV
[21:39:50] <skill> (or something else)
