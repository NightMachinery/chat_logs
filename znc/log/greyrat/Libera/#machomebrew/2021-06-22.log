[19:16:45] <jbowen> Hello, I'm very new to mac (new job and they issued me one; not new to Unix)
[19:17:15] <jbowen> I've been using Homebrew to install packages and ran into an issue with matterhorn that I haven't encountered before
[19:17:57] <jbowen> Here's the message I receive: “matterhorn” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
[19:18:27] <jbowen> What is the "proper" thing to do, here?

[20:46:25] <R2robot> jbowen: usually you can open the security and privacy tab in the control panel and click the button to allow it to open anyway
[20:46:57] <R2robot> if it's the most recent thing you tried to launch
[20:55:45] <jbowen> How are the developers of the other things I've installed verified?

[21:23:40] <sixecho> jbowen: some cask devs dont use apple's signature stuff in the slightest -- you can get around that by (uninstalling it first) and then using `brew install --no-quarantine matterhorn`
[21:24:58] <sixecho> jbowen: the software is useless otherwise, not sure why brew doesn't require cask devs to at least tag casks about this so it can warn users.  but since it's a security/trust thing i can see why brew doesn't want to bypass it for you by default.
[21:26:58] <sixecho> jbowen: if things are already installed and you want to resolve that the low-level way you can do `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine path-to-thing` -- i've only used this on .app's - but as matterhorn installs via a binary - not 100% what it does or where it puts files (to pass to xattr)
[21:36:51] <jbowen> So the proper thing would be for the upstream project to use Apple's code signing
[21:55:13] <R2robot> yeah, but some don't want to pay the 100USD/year for the apple dev license
[22:03:12] <jbowen> Ah, yeah, that sucks
[22:09:55] <jbowen> In that case, I'm surprised so many others do pay for it
[22:15:43] <R2robot> well as far as I know, it's only for GUI apps
[22:21:43] <jbowen> Matterhorn is a terminal client for Mattermost (written in Haskell)
[22:23:02] <jbowen> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:25:26] <R2robot> but it launches on it's own right?
[22:25:36] <R2robot> you're not launching it from Apple Terminal or iTerm2?
[22:26:16] <R2robot> a bit confused about what it actually is. lol
[22:26:50] <jbowen> no, I'm running it in Terminal
[22:27:46] <R2robot> hmm

[22:27:55] <R2robot> yeah, was just reading through that.
