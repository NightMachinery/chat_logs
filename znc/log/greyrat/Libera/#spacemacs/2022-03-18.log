[01:16:42] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay. I'll try that out to to help with testing. It seems that by default, Helm ignored "normal" completing-read-extra-properties. That's why I asked if you use Helm or Ivy.
[01:20:44] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @lebensterben Is the Compleseus layer evilified? Does it have C-j and C-k, for example when a minibuffer opens for completion candidates?
[01:29:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I added them
[01:29:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> not yet

[01:33:45] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> we have a number of local packages, in a "local" directory within some layers

[01:59:45] <FromGitter> <kassick> if so, it will save me a lot of time when it bothers me enough to fix it ;)

[02:05:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> when Emacs 28 is released, we need to make them native compilable

[07:35:30] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> GitHub doesn't provide anything like "Popular Forks", either, so with the number of forks of Spacemacs that exist it would be difficult to find an alternative source.
