[00:35:47] <wasamasa> oh, a gimped programming language
[00:35:52] <ryanprior[m]> https://www.mint-lang.com/ it's pretty decent :)
[00:35:53] <dale> cellofellow: I've looked at web-mode's code, and while I use it, ISTR its code did not strike me as an example for others to aspire to.  I wonder if polymode can help.  (I wonder if polymode is still maintained.)
[00:35:54] <cvanduse`> the lang with the minty fresh flavour 
[00:36:02] <wasamasa> if you cannot implement lisp in it, it sucks

[00:36:25] <wasamasa> I've implemented MAL in elisp just fine
[00:36:37] <bpalmer> I can't implement lisp in lots of languages.

[00:38:31] <ryanprior[m]> I've noticed a number of issues where my Emacs is indenting or highlighting things incorrectly in mint-lang buffers. Where do I get started in debugging that? Are there particular guides or info pages you'd recommend?
[00:38:50] <rudybot> cvanduse`: Yeah, selling software on shelves is passé.
[00:39:02] <wasamasa> maybe mint can be coerced into being turned into a REPL
[00:39:10] <wasamasa> but you'd probably be writing JS at that point
[00:39:26] <bpalmer> ryanprior[m]: for highlighting, font-lock-keywords
[00:39:43] <bpalmer> font licking is the jargon for this
[00:39:47] <bpalmer> locking
[00:39:51] <cvanduse`> lol 
[00:40:04] <ryanprior[m]> Does font-lock cover both indentation & highlighting?
[00:40:10] <wasamasa> no
[00:40:10] <bpalmer> nope
[00:40:16] <wasamasa> indentation is its own beast
[00:40:27] <bpalmer> and much simpler
[00:40:39] <ryanprior[m]> Okay so I should probably tackle those things independently
[00:41:02] <bpalmer> the heart of indenting is usually indent-line-function
[00:42:44] <bpalmer> ryanprior[m]: specifically, major modes often bind TAB to indent-according-to-mode, which normally calls the function that the variable indent-line-function specifies.
[00:42:50] <wasamasa> it's derived from js-jsx-mode
[00:42:57] <wasamasa> so messing with indentation could be challenging

[00:44:02] <wasamasa> js-mode is the thing Steve "I ported Rhino to elisp for fun" Yegge failed to write a decent indentation function for
[00:44:13] <bpalmer> didn't he write js2?
[00:44:16] <wasamasa> he did
[00:44:36] <bpalmer> so he failed to handle indenting in js-mode and wrote a whole new mode for it?
[00:44:44] <wasamasa> and he still wasn't happy with indentation and got help from a person who contributed the indenter not only for js2-mode, but for js-mode as well
[00:44:49] <skykanin> for some reason my emacs is linting functions like `-filter` and `mapcar` saying "<function> is not known to be defined" even though I can find their docs in emacs and the code runs fine. Weird

[00:47:00] <wasamasa> it also uses cc-mode somehow, lol
[00:47:21] <wasamasa> but seemingly just for filling
[00:48:22] <skykanin> Actually it's only complaining about missing `-filter`s definition. The mapcar was a different error (calling it with one argument when it requires two, even though I'm using the thread last macro)

[00:49:30] <bpalmer> ryanprior[m]: since the mode by default calls a mint formatter when you save the filter, the indentation shouldn't need to be perfect, right?

[02:23:24] <makomo> does anyone know what exactly is the meaning of an "emulation mode"? the manual says this about emulation-mode-map-alists: "This variable holds a list of keymap alists to use for emulation modes."
[02:23:42] <makomo> i get how the thing works and the precedence it has, but what exactly is an "emulation mode"? why "emulation"?
[02:24:05] <makomo> (i'm looking into how exactly evil implements its states and the various keymaps)
[02:24:05] <wasamasa> editor emulation
[02:24:28] <alphapapa[m]> oh hi wasamasa :)
[02:25:03] <makomo> wasamasa: so that customization point was added specifically in order to implement emulations of other editors (such as vim)? was that the original motivation?
[02:25:32] <makomo> do you know if it was added perhaps because of evil, or is it much older than that?
[02:25:39] <wasamasa> it is a lot older than that
[02:26:05] <wasamasa> mostly used by viper, followed by cua

[02:27:22] <wasamasa> alphapapa[m]: hello
[02:27:29] <makomo> "using multiple minor-mode keymaps" in particular
[02:27:38] <wasamasa> so evil does this thing of having multiple keymaps and switching between them
[02:27:40] <makomo> i.e. what would those be in the case of evil e.g.
[02:27:48] <wasamasa> where each keymap corresponds to a vim mode
[02:27:51] <makomo> as in motion-state-map, insert-state-map, etc.?
[02:27:53] <wasamasa> yes
[02:28:25] <makomo> hmm, i see. so there's a single minor-mode (evil-mode), but it has multiple different keymaps?
[02:28:52] <makomo> or are the various vim states realized as individual minor modes as well?
[02:30:03] <wasamasa> there's just one minor mode with several keymaps
[02:30:10] <skykanin> Anyone here tried guilemacs? Is it usable?
[02:31:17] <makomo> wasamasa: is there some resource (other than the source code itself) regarding the way that evil (its internals) works? i've found the evil guide by noctuid, but that's more of a high-level overview

[02:31:37] <makomo> a longish comment within the source code is fine too i suppose, but just something that gives you a nice look at the internals

[02:39:51] <technomancy> alphapapa[m]: yeah
[02:40:11] <alphapapa[m]> Ok, I'll try to remember that
[02:40:16] <technomancy> in the matrix channels I administer that are bridged, the /topic asks people not to use replies or edits
[02:40:35] <technomancy> edits are much worse because people keep doing it repeatedly without realizing that every edit sends a new line to the channel =)
[02:40:40] <alphapapa[m]> I figured the bridges would have that worked out by now
[02:40:54] <technomancy> really it's a flaw with matrix that they don't support disabling it on a per-channel basis
[02:40:57] <alphapapa[m]> Yeah, my client doesn't handle redactions yet, so edits are very annoying, especially when people are tidying source blocks
[02:41:30] <alphapapa[m]> Well, Matrix is ultimately a pretty free-form protocol, any client can send any event in any format, so it would be hard to restrict that

[02:48:41] <aidalgol> If it ever becomes possible to run a matrix server without having to open up my wallet and set fire to it, I'll revisit it.
[02:48:50] <technomancy> more powerful in ways that don't matter to me, I guess
[02:48:57] <technomancy> kind of like pulseaudio or wayland

[02:50:10] <aidalgol> alphapapa[m]: Wayland isn't meant to be a reimplementation of X.  It's meant to be fundamentally different.

[02:50:30] <aidalgol> alphapapa[m]: Yeah, maybe don't have electric modes on in chat modes. xD
[02:50:40] <alphapapa[m]> I know that, but the point is that they are not reimplementing many of X's features, which results in a less powerful system

[02:52:14] <alphapapa[m]> How is saying that Wayland intentionally leaves unimplemented some features that X has a case of FUD?
[02:52:41] <aidalgol> Saying that it is *worse* because it doesn't let you do exactly what you can with X is sort of FUD.
[02:52:55] <alphapapa[m]> I didn't say that it's worse
[02:52:58] <aidalgol> But I was also thinking of pulseaudio, systemd, and so on.
[02:53:00] <technomancy> I'll say it
[02:53:02] <technomancy> it's worse
[02:53:24] <alphapapa[m]> I agree that it's worse in some ways, and it's better in others, the question is whether it's worth it to a certain user
[02:53:27] <hodapp> I think it has to go a bit further to qualify as FUD
[02:53:28] <aidalgol> It's new.  It will have growing pains.
[02:53:46] <technomancy> FUD stands for Fear Uncertainty and Doubt. I have very specific things that suck about Wayland that make it much worse for me.
[02:53:52] <hodapp> and note that FUD doesn't just mean "something you disagree with"
[02:53:52] <technomancy> there's nothing uncertain there
[02:53:57] <alphapapa[m]> What gets me is that the devs don't seem to /care/ about the features they are leaving unimplemented, so what are users to do?
[02:53:59] <aidalgol> technomancy: You also still insist pulseaudio is inherently worse than ALSA.
[02:54:04] <technomancy> aidalgol: yeah!
[02:54:10] <technomancy> because it can't fucking play audio on my computer!

[02:55:21] <technomancy> also I got a brand new computer; it's not even the same vendor. pulseaudio can't play from mpd out of the box. and it can't even switch from the speakers to the headphones automatically when you plug them in and out

[02:56:35] <technomancy> anyway, even if I don't find matrix to be useful to me personally, the fact that they focus on bridging as a first-class concept instead of an afterthought makes me respect them. also the fact that they're competing against slack and discord more than IRC makes me want them to win.
[02:56:44] <aidalgol> OK, because I have the headphone-switching problem on my rig, but even ALSA has that problem on this hardware.
[02:57:18] <aidalgol> Anyway, I was trying to highlight your tendency to dislike newer tech as a reason to take your criticism of Wayland with a grain of salt.

[03:07:19] <alphapapa[m]> no what I mean is, Matrix already supports HTML messages and Markdown format, so we just use ox.el to convert from Org format to them.  It's pretty simple really.
[03:07:41] <alphapapa[m]> I even made it so you can pop out a separate buffer to edit a message in Org format, just like editing an Org source block
[03:07:42] <technomancy> I was thinking, you can leave it up to the client to decide which representation to use based on the same logic as a MUA

[06:53:53] <nekobit> I just used normal dired to do all those renames, i suppose it can do more?

[12:21:53] <wasamasa> well, the story with elisp is not so good
[12:22:19] <wasamasa> you could study the elisp intro, but after some point it's all about studying other people's code, writing some and consulting the elisp reference

[22:20:29] <makomo> is it ok to use the kill-ring as sort of an interface between a command and the code i'm writing? e.g. sp-kill-sexp kills the sexp after point and puts it into the kill ring. since i'm using it programatically, and want both the side-effect and the actual string, right after using it i access (car kill-ring) and then pop the kill-ring so that the user is left unaffected.
[22:20:58] <makomo> is there anything more idiomatic? do i need to take any precautions when doing this (e.g. save and pop the kill-ring immediately after calling the command)?

[23:09:36] <_73> Is there a way I can change vim style tags to etags. I have a tags file that works in vim but does not work with emacs. The program I use to generate the tags does not have an option to create etags. The tags generated look like `bar	foobar.pl	/^bar(/`. The program though has the options to make the tags with line numbers instead of regexps.
