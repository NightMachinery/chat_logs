[05:56:57] <feepbot> <gwern> 'When Elizabeth Sinclair and her family arrived on the shores of Ni‚Äôihau, some 1000 native Hawaiians were living there under the rule of King Kamehameha I, who sold their island to the white newcomers. Within a few years, more than two-thirds of the population had moved away. The exact number of indigenous inhabitants on Ni‚Äòihau today is unknown ‚Äì a 2010 census
[05:56:57] <feepbot> accounts for 170 residents, while witnesses have said as little as 25 to 50 people, just five families, still live on the island. Like all Hawaiians, they are considered American citizens, but they also live on a private island, which means they must abide by the rules of the family who owns it. Such rules include abstaining from alcohol and cigarettes, which are banned on
[05:56:57] <feepbot> Ni‚Äôihau. Men aren‚Äôt allowed to grow beards or have long hair (the reasoning for which is unclear). Residents are also not allowed to talk about Ni‚Äôihau to the media and if they decide to leave the island for an extended period of time for any reason, they are considered outsiders and usually won‚Äôt be able to return. The task of policing the coming and going of islanders,
[05:57:02] <feepbot> among other things, has fallen to Bruce Robinson‚Äôs wife, Leiana Robinson. Despite being a native Hawaiian, born and raised on Ni‚Äôihau, she runs a tight ship and makes sure islanders abide by the Robinson family rules. It‚Äôs maintained that these rules are in place to protect the villagers and their ancient traditions, as well as the island itself. All residents, including the
[05:57:02] <feepbot> Robinsons, speak a unique dialect of Hawaiian that was once spoken on Kauai before English became the official language. The average Ni‚Äôihauan will have never met a foreign tourist. A WW2 barge delivers supplies, but Ni‚Äòihauans generally forage for food and grow their own crops, while meat from Ni‚Äòihau‚Äôs livestock is free (and any meat that safari guests do not take with
[05:57:02] <feepbot> them is given to the village).' https://www.messynessychic.com/2021/08/25/hawaiis-forbidden-island-and-the-real-life-swiss-family-robinson-who-controls-it/ this sounds like the setup for a horror film

[06:00:16] <nshepperd2> basically
[06:00:19] <shawwwn> what does it mean to contract over them?
[06:00:27] <nshepperd2> just summing over it
[06:00:44] <nshepperd2> like in an einsum ij,jk -> ik

[06:01:57] <adiabatic> if I didn't know any better I'd think that you started typing without noticing that your hands weren't on the right keys
[06:02:11] <shawwwn> well, noob question: what does it mean to sum over that dim? not reduce_sum, right?
[06:04:05] <nshepperd2> reduce_sum(x,dim=1) is ~ einsum ijk->ik
[06:04:12] <nshepperd2> j is a contracting dimension there

[06:04:26] <nshepperd2> or like, reduce_sum is an example of it
[06:05:26] <shawwwn> well, that example makes sense. but what about ijk,ijk->ik? I'm not sure if that even makes any sense at all, since I still can't think about it properly...
[06:05:32] <nshepperd2> the true meaning of einsum ijk->ik is this: output[i,k] = sum(input[i,j,k] for j in range(input.shape[1]))
[06:05:47] <mst> "ijk,ijk->ik" just reads to me as literal dutch ;)

[07:00:35] <gwern> ...no more loops, at which point madoka then will become a magical girl and because of the loops, is guaranteed to destroy the world. the stakes, in fact, are as high as possible, it's not a matter of 'oh well if homura happened to lose this time as well, she'd just reset again'. this reminds me of _zeroth maria_ which makes the good point that a time looper is in some ways more vulnerable...
[07:00:41] <gwern> ...and weaker than the non-loopers, because they can be damaged by endless loops while non-loopers credibly precommit to act the same way each time)
[07:06:35] <gwern> (this is probably a pretty interesting game theory setting. I'd expect results like 'being known to be a looper badly damages loopers' ability to win games', because then the non-loopers can decide 'once' for all loops, and if there is any chance of wearing down the looper, they win)

[12:09:26] <capisce> well, that's how Java, Lisp and many other languages behave as well I guess
[12:09:42] <capisce> there's shallow / reference equality, and deep / structural equality
[12:09:48] <feep[work]> there is no deep equality
[12:10:01] <feep[work]> in js, there is shallow equality, and different shallow equality.
[12:10:10] <capisce> right
[12:10:38] <feep[work]> (neat, like D, does "==" for "deep equal" and "is" for "shallow equal")
[12:10:49] <feep[work]> (or, in our terms, equality vs identity)
[12:11:14] <feep[work]> also I'm making objects non-nullable by default, whee~
[12:11:19] <capisce> haha, stackoverflow suggests doing JSON.stringify(a1) === JSON.stringify(a2)
[12:11:39] <rsaarelm> Aren't non-nullable objects the obvious right choice?
[12:11:43] <nshepperd> shallow equality and superficial equality
[12:12:04] <rsaarelm> You need to have a type system that can do nice lightweight Option types of course.
[12:12:10] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:12:18] <saturn2> lisp has standard functions for 5 different levels of equality depth
[12:12:31] <capisce> shallow equality, everyone is equally woke
[12:12:33] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: yes, which is why I started out with nullable objects, then later added lightweight option types, and am now changing to optional-nullable objects
[12:12:39] <nshepperd> oh gdi unison crashes with stack overflow now because i have too many files
[12:12:56] <capisce> yeah, the equality story in Lisp seems pretty complicated
[12:13:01] <feep[work]> ie. class C { } nullable C c;
[12:13:08] <rsaarelm> I mean, don't have a whole concept of "nullability" at language level, it's a library idiom thing you get with the Option type.
[12:13:13] <feep[work]> meh
[12:13:15] <capisce> gdi unison?
[12:13:16] <feep[work]> it's sometimes useful
[12:13:21] <feep[work]> like C compat
[12:13:26] <nshepperd> god damn it
[12:13:54] <rsaarelm> Where's your ambition, the goal is to get rid of C and rewrite the stack from assembly up.

[14:16:12] <shawwwn> by the way, kindiana pointed out a neat trick. suppose you have 12 blocks in a GPT. If you stack each parameter so that its leading axis shape is 12, then you can call jax.lax.scan on it. https://github.com/shawwn/openai-server/blob/jax-wip/openai_server/gpt/jax/gpt.py#L244

[23:00:53] <gwern> *probably*
[23:01:20] <rmmh> how does wikipedia store page versions anyways
[23:01:28] <gwern> and even if it's legal to merely possess a copy, that doesn't cover distribution - where did you *copy* that copy from?
[23:01:36] <shawwwn> there's no probably
[23:01:43] <gwern> no, it most definitely is in fact probably
[23:01:47] <gwern> even OA concedes that
[23:02:06] <gwern> the transformativeness of training is not established by any court case, doctrine, or law
[23:02:32] <shawwwn> (gwern finds things to worry about. but he is of course the best kind of correct)
[23:02:36] <gwern> we just tend to think that if tested, courts will go with transformativeness, in part because the consequences on ML and many other things would be so catastrophic
[23:03:02] <gwern> however, the EFF and other groups are actively trying to sabotage transformativeness out of a extremely misguided belief that it'll hurt the big guys more than the little guys
[23:03:22] <rmmh> Wikimedia sites use a MySQL-backed external storage cluster with blobs of a few dozen revisions. The first revision of the blob is stored in full, and following revisions to the same page are stored as diffs relative to the previous revision; the blobs are then gzipped. Because the revisions are grouped per page, they tend to be similar, so the diffs are relatively small and gzip works well. The
[23:03:24] <rmmh> compression ratio achieved on Wikimedia sites nears 98%.
[23:03:54] <shawwwn> source on EFF?
[23:04:48] <gwern> rmmh: gzip doesn't get 98% on text... xz doesn't either, it gets like 10:1. I don't think even zpaq can do 98%. is that comparing to something like 'storing each revision as a separate full page gzipped'?
[23:05:04] <rmmh> presumably. or maybe storing each separate page uncompressed

[23:09:03] <shawwwn> "how to have conversations with people" is such a zuckerberg way to phrase it tho
