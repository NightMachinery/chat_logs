[06:39:52] <tomreyn> !7.04 | Guest98
[06:39:52] <ubottu> Guest98: Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) was the sixth release of Ubuntu. End Of Life: October 19th, 2008. See !eol and !upgrade for more details.

[06:41:06] <Guest98> that doesn't really answer my question
[06:41:09] <Guest98> !eol
[06:41:09] <ubottu> End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[06:41:21] <tomreyn> this release will have many, many unfixed vulnerabilities. the release is certainly not "active". i already pointed you to where old apt archives can be found.
[06:41:55] <tomreyn> "compiz" is still available in current ubuntu releases
[06:42:30] <Guest98> awesome. Thanks. Yes but it doesn't have any of the custom features compiz had in its heyday (such as cube desktop, fire, water, wobbly windows etc)

[06:44:51] <leftyfb> Guest98: compiz isn't a requirement, it's personal preference fluff that is outdated and unsupported

[06:46:13] <leftyfb> Guest98: if your "requirements" are for an OS that went unsupported 14 years ago, then they aren't valid requirements
[06:46:35] <Guest98> my requirements are to play with wobbly windows so your argument is invalid
[06:47:01] <Guest98> you can actually get them in 20.10 with gnome shell extensions but another one of my requirements is the fire tool

[06:50:34] <tomreyn> Miruku: also, i would be surprised if their clipboard sharing does not depend on X.
[06:51:45] <Miruku> Yeah, I was reading that as well. Not really wanting to install x. Kind of defeats the purpose of my development environment. At that point I would just pay a few bucks to host in aws.

[11:14:58] <yevhenivanchenko> We have a request. This is about Ubuntu 20.04. There is a bug with dhcp in the package network-manager 1.22.10-1ubuntu2.2. This bug is described on redhat bugtracker - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817788. Here you can see "error -113 dispatching events" in log. It seems the issue was resolved in network manager  1.22.12. Is it possible to update(or fix) the network-manager package in repository? It affects many users, I suppose.

[13:54:35] <pikaro> Hi! On Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS, looking at ip addr I see that my IPv6 address is autoconfigured as 2001:db8:dead:beef::/64. IOW, the server is receiving a prefix but not assigning itself an IP. why is that the case, and what is this configured "address" for? it doesn't seem to respond to all addresses under it which was my first guess. is it possible to just have it append its EUI-64? I wouldn't like to
[13:54:37] <pikaro> manually configure it as static - there's currently no Netplan file and this is a Docker server so the possibility of breaking something is high.
