[00:03:47] <White_Flame> if the goal is to get non-involved non-enthusiast users to use free software, then the only hurdle is convenience, not ideals
[00:04:03] <White_Flame> but, that's been discussed over and over and over again already :)
[00:04:31] <craigt> zleap: Windows 15 is out?

[00:11:37] <White_Flame> doing what you can is impossible, as it's an infinite number of actions
[00:13:26] <zleap> telling me what I am doing is never good enough is never going to help either
[00:13:59] <madage> zleap: I don't know if emplyers have that great of a say on demand. The way I see it, for ordinary computer usage they rely on windows/msoffice just because then they don't need to spend on training because they can rely on the fact that most people have some prior experience with that
[00:14:25] <zleap> madage, yes indeed
[00:14:41] <zleap> most training courses are for office / windows
[00:15:13] <zleap> https://www.learndevon.co.uk/
[00:15:43] <zleap> to be a tutor with them needs an arms length of requirements, their courses team come up with the course content
[00:15:54] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[00:17:42] <zleap> so despite the fact that LibreOffice has excellent books,  we need libraries to stock them
[00:17:50] <madage> so that's where we need to focus, we need more people to be comfortable with gnu desktop userland, more people conscious that there is choice
[00:17:50] <zleap> make people aware alternatives exist
[00:18:02] <madage> agreed
[00:18:03] <zleap> yes,  but how do we do that
[00:18:17] <madage> baby steps
[00:18:38] <madage> one user at a time and hope for exponential rules to apply
[00:19:03] <zleap> children / young people seem far more open minded
[00:19:15] <zleap> what we also need is a more activie fediverse
[00:19:26] <madage> certainly, they are far more curious and less prejudiced
[00:19:32] <zleap> indeed
[00:20:58] <zleap> to be a tutor with learn devon is a far too much paoerwork and requirements
[00:21:10] <zleap> even to just run say a few workshops

[03:38:39] <Guest88> what is truth?
[03:39:20] <isf> i make the question becouse i dont know if you are speaking abour the kernel or you are speaking about the GNU Operating system
[03:40:04] <Guest88> yeah I'm asking for quite opposite to GNU
[03:40:19] <Guest88> I'm actually collecting non gnu utils
[03:40:30] <Guest88> non-commercial, just for myself
[03:41:31] <Guest88> the problem that most of GNU utils has large codebase
[03:41:31] <isf> if have a non-comercial license that mean the software is non-free and propietary
[03:41:58] <Guest88> nope
[03:42:10] <Guest88> it's just not GPL, but BSD
[03:42:35] <Guest88> not propietary
[03:42:36] <isf> if the software cant be used for comercial isnt free license
[03:42:38] *** Quits: evanextreme (~evan@64.187.160.183) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:42:55] <Guest88> Ok)
[03:43:20] <Guest88> It could be used for whatever one want
[03:43:32] <isf> i dont know what are  you trying to do, sound trivial becouse, the GNU Operating System works
[03:43:44] *** Joins: evanextreme (~evan@64.187.160.183)
[03:43:48] <isf> and is completly free
[03:43:58] <isf> in terms of freedom, never in terms of price
[03:44:13] <Guest88> Great but what I want is small code base
[03:44:28] <Guest88> and BSD license
[03:44:38] <Guest88> BSD is UNIX
[03:44:44] <Guest88> GNU you know)
[03:44:51] <DiffieHellman> Guest88: Which BSD license? One of the BSD licenses are nonfree.
[03:44:54] <jxself> GNU's *Not* UNIX ;)
[03:44:55] <isf> i dont undestend
[03:45:38] <Guest88> BSD 1/2 clause or MIT or any similar license
[03:45:43] <DiffieHellman> The many BSD's were derived from Unix, but most BSD's aren't Unix - as that's a trademark you gotta pay for.
[03:46:07] <Guest88> I do not bother with tm
[03:46:21] <isf> if you need pay for or not isnt the important issue
[03:46:25] <DiffieHellman> Trademark violation is still kinda illegal.
[03:46:29] <isf> the issue is the restrictions

[03:47:05] <DiffieHellman> Guest88: Well, those are pushover permissive licenses and are a free handout to proprietary software, which is the pinnicale of stupidity as your free software is just turned into proprietary software.
[03:47:13] <Guest88> I'm just asking is there net tools implementation licensed under BSD
[03:47:18] <isf> Guest88 linux isnt a operating system
[03:47:28] <DiffieHellman> Linux is a Unix-like kernel, Unix is a proprietary OS, why are you comparing them?
[03:47:29] <isf> you are asking about the GNU Operating System?

[03:48:16] <isf> you are in the Free Software Foundation Chat
[03:48:23] <isf> remmeber it
[03:48:29] <Guest88> Yoki
[03:49:09] <Guest88> but aren't mentioned licenses fsf approved
[03:49:10] <isf> in all cases, the BSD Operating System dont have distributions what respect the users freedom
[03:49:32] <Guest88> What I want is BSD licensed code
[03:49:52] <DiffieHellman> Guest88: You want code that you can turn into proprietary software.
[03:50:04] <DiffieHellman> Why would we at the FSF help you with that?
[03:50:09] <Guest88> That's your guess
[03:50:09] <isf> Why you want software with a weak license?
[03:50:31] <Guest88> Because I do not want GPL code on my home computer
[03:50:37] <isf> why you dont want the defense for your freedom called Copyleft into the copyright?
[03:51:00] <jxself> What do run on your home computer?
[03:51:05] <DiffieHellman> Guest88: Why do you hate the GPL so much?
[03:51:10] <Guest88> linux in single user mode
[03:51:15] <Guest88> right now
[03:51:24] <jxself> There's some GPLed code right there ;)
[03:51:25] <Guest88> one of my laptops with depbbed kernel
[03:51:29] <Guest88> yeah
[03:51:30] <isf> but the user normaly dont use linux
[03:51:37] <isf> the users normaly use the GNU Operating System
[03:51:42] <Guest88> init=/bin/sh
[03:51:43] <DiffieHellman> You're running GNU/Linux or BusyBox/Linux, if you had just Linux, your computer wouldn't be usable.
[03:52:03] <jxself> What program is at /bin/sh?
[03:52:09] <Guest88> sh i pdksh
[03:52:38] <DiffieHellman> So you use pdksh/Linux
[03:52:39] <Guest88> the kernel is depblobbed
[03:52:49] <Guest88> you would probably like it
[03:53:01] <isf> we use the free kernel of the GNU Project
[03:53:01] <DiffieHellman> So you ran the GNU Linux-libre patchset?
[03:53:17] <Guest88> I hate stuff I do not 99% control of it
[03:53:18] <Guest88> yes
[03:53:21] <Guest88> it's GPL
[03:53:23] <Guest88> and I'm OK
[03:53:27] <Guest88> wtith it
[03:53:32] <Guest88> but userland I want BSD
[03:53:35] <isf> linux kernel is under GPL and have nonfree software
[03:53:55] <Guest88> what non free sw
[03:53:57] <DiffieHellman> You 100% control GPL software that you use. We're not handing out 100% control for distribution for obvious reasons/
[03:54:00] <isf> thats the reason we use the kernel of the GNU Project, the gnu-linux-libre kernel without nonfree software
[03:54:16] <DiffieHellman> isf: *The kernel, Linux is under the GPLv2-only actually
[03:54:25] <Guest88> i'm running gnu-linux-libre
[03:54:27] <isf> yes, only in v2
[03:54:33] <Guest88> kernel I mean
[03:54:41] <isf> xD
[03:54:42] <jxself> That's the effective license. It's a patchwork of many.
[03:54:52] <Guest88> but userspace is BSD
[03:55:02] <isf> but, Guest88 here you have distros for have the 100% of the control of your computing:
[03:55:08] <jxself> But in terms of what nonfree software, the Linux-libre people maintain a list of what changes are made to turn it into Linux-libre: http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/5.16.9-gnu/linux-libre-5.16.9-gnu.log
[03:55:08] <isf> https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[03:55:46] <jxself> Let's try to keep things in scope here. In the software freedom world, the enemy of control over your computing isn't the GPL - It's proprietary software.
[03:55:59] <Guest88> I hate all these distros that's why I'm making own for myslef
[03:56:14] <Guest88> And never will switch from it
[03:56:15] <jxself> Good luck with that.
[03:56:19] <Guest88> Tq
[03:56:34] <isf> what distro are you using? Guest88
[03:57:00] <Guest88> I was using parabola but there started gpg sihit problems
[03:57:04] <Guest88> I hate this
[03:57:14] <isf> and now?
[03:57:30] <Guest88> init=/bin/pdksh
[03:57:43] <Guest88> actulally openbsd ksh
[03:58:12] <isf> sadly the openbsd arent a free distro
[03:58:21] <Guest88> there is librebsd
[03:58:28] <Guest88> it has the same ksh
[03:58:33] <jxself> It's not clear to me that LibreBSD is being maintained anymore.
[03:58:42] <Guest88> no
[03:58:49] <Guest88> what are you taking about
[03:58:54] <Guest88> pkh is not libre?
[03:58:59] <Guest88> pdkh is not libre?
[03:59:14] <Guest88> it's common domain
[03:59:17] <jxself> isf was talking about OpenBSD, which has some nonfree bits...
[03:59:29] <jxself> Not sure why that's relevant about the shell piece... :)
[03:59:32] <Guest88> yes i removed these and used to run
[03:59:34] <Guest88> also
[03:59:47] <Guest88> but I tried prting drivers
[03:59:51] <Guest88> tired
[04:00:00] <isf> in all case, the only real free operating systems are the free distros of the gnu with gnu-linux-libre kernel
[04:00:13] <DiffieHellman> Or GNU/Hurd.
[04:00:17] <isf> why you dont want use a free distro Guest88?
[04:00:35] <isf> oh yes the gnu/hurd
[04:00:53] <jxself> Recently I've started liking the shortening of GNU/Hurd to gnurd. Like nerd with a g at the front. :)
[04:00:53] <Guest88> because it make me depended on remote gpg key and similar stuff
[04:01:05] <Guest88> second thing I wnat to keep my userland small
[04:01:11] <Guest88> as small as possible
[04:01:28] <Guest88> to be able to investigate any issue in reasonable time
[04:01:47] <jxself> Good luck with that. You may not find non-GPLed implementations of everything for use with Linux.
[04:03:53] <isf> jxself one question
[04:04:26] <isf> if hyperbola move to bsd, they can move from the hyperbola gnu/linux-libre or they go to need a complete re-installations of it?

[04:08:17] <Guest88> "the enemy of control over your computing isn't the GPL - It's proprietary software." no it's also additional semantics that any license applies to code. for me it would be perfect to have everythin in common domain
[04:08:45] <Guest88> it's called "terms of use"
[04:10:05] <yrk> Guest88: you are right that if everything, and I do mean everything, was perfectly free for everyone then that would be the best. but in the world we live in, in which most software is proprietary, we are forced to fight for our rights, and need strong tools like the gpl to do so.
[04:10:39] <Kolev> To ignore this reality is to be a foolish libertarian.
[04:11:30] <Guest88> yes I agree to lcense evrything in gpl but not my laptop
[04:12:30] <DiffieHellman> You hate freedom that much you won't have it on your own computer?
[04:13:08] <Guest88> my computer is only mine
[04:15:04] <Guest88> with no additional semantics, that's what I want. It's not possible 100%, but I want be as much close as possible
[04:15:20] <Guest88> not possible without oshw
[04:17:52] <DiffieHellman> "open source hardware" doesn't exist, as source code doesn't pertain to hardware.
[04:17:59] <DiffieHellman> There are free hardware designs though.
[04:18:29] <Kolev> If I buy a chair and it does not come with the design, I'm not buying it. :P
[04:19:14] <Guest88> Not only design

[23:22:16] <furrymcgee> public code public money 
[23:22:31] <ewwegweg> how?
[23:23:01] <White_Flame> make money & make software don't have to be the same thing
[23:23:04] *** Joins: mixfix41 (~homefame@user/mixfix41)
[23:23:36] <ewwegweg> but I need to continue my life White_Flame
[23:23:44] <White_Flame> then work?
[23:24:16] <ewwegweg> Which job
[23:24:32] <ewwegweg> Non free software?

[23:25:06] <White_Flame> doesn't need to have anyting to do with software.  And if you want to build software, work a job that doesn't use the same energy as softwre dev
[23:25:25] <zleap> i am sure there is money in things like providing tech support
[23:25:28] <zleap> or hosting
[23:25:55] <ewwegweg> White_Flame without software job i guess
[23:25:57] <ewwegweg> ?
[23:26:30] <White_Flame> I own my own business.  But I did find that when I was working non-software jobs, my personal software productivity increased a ton
[23:26:43] <zleap> ok so things like jitsi, or LibreAdventure are free software
[23:26:58] <White_Flame> because I had that itch to code at work, and my mind was free to linger on software things
[23:27:04] <zleap> if you are able to host instances for people they could pay you to host / maintain it (as in install patches etc)
[23:27:15] <White_Flame> without burning that out on others' softwrae
[23:27:54] <isf> i sell free software
[23:27:56] <zleap> yeah otherwise you are coding all day, work and outside of work
[23:28:04] <isf> is like cooking zleap
[23:28:17] <isf> if you make food you dont get money
[23:28:25] <isf> but, if you distribute your food to others, they can pay you
[23:28:50] <isf> if you have a company, who sell for example, milk you never go to get money making milk
[23:28:57] <isf> you get money selling milk to others

[23:29:19] <isf> so, if you want get money with software, the only ethical way is sell the software.
[23:29:20] <ewwegweg> Is other jobs make sense?
[23:29:21] <ewwegweg> isf
[23:29:27] <ewwegweg> White_Flame
[23:29:34] <isf> you dont need restrict the users for  get money, that is inmoral 
[23:29:34] <White_Flame> if you're not entrepreneurial-minded, though, get a non-software job
[23:29:34] <zleap> isf, or sell related services
[23:30:00] <isf> if you work in a nonfree software company you are doing something inmoral
[23:30:05] <isf> becouse nonfree software is inmoral
[23:30:26] <zleap> people need to eat, put a roof over their head etc
[23:30:29] <isf> becouse you get money for the restrictions, no for the software

[23:30:39] <ewwegweg> Is oficer make sense?
[23:30:44] <isf> if you want to eat, you need get money, that need sell your software
[23:31:05] <isf> if you get money restriction that mean rob the freedoms of the people that is inmoral
[23:31:59] <isf> if you are a developper, you are the same as a miner
[23:32:03] <isf> you dont make money mining
[23:32:12] <zleap> if I download the tresquel iso, burn to a cd, print a lable and put in a nice case then that is a service
[23:32:15] <isf> you get money selling the gold, and the precious materials
[23:32:27] <isf> Trisquel
[23:32:32] <isf> yes, thats i do
[23:32:42] <isf> i work selling free software
[23:33:01] <ewwegweg> isf oficer? I think make sense
[23:33:02] <isf> the last time, i sell Newpipe, a free software program for see youtube without DRM
[23:33:12] <isf> 17USD 
[23:33:14] <isf> for it

[23:33:46] <ewwegweg> Is NewPipe own is you isf?
[23:33:55] <isf> im the owner of my copy
[23:34:10] <isf> so i have freedom to sell it and share it how i wish for eny purpuse
[23:34:38] <isf> and i have the source code for modify it if i want and i distribute it with the binary executable and the source code
[23:34:59] <isf> and get money for share it for a price, is the direct way to get money with software
