[02:05:32] <flatcap> aplund: great.  the colour of the "tree chars" in the subject are now merged with the indicator (highlight) colour (if possible)
[02:05:57] <flatcap> default == transparent, in some situations

[02:07:30] <aplund> flatcap: as in "color tree" ?
[02:07:59] <aplund> and is color0 == transparent?
[02:10:14] <flatcap> yes, to "color tree"
[02:10:51] <flatcap> color 0-7 are the basic colours black, red, green, ...
[02:11:01] <aplund> mine has "color tree color7 color0"
[02:11:02] <flatcap> so color0 != default
[02:11:30] <flatcap> hmm... I'd expect white tree char on a black backgroung

[02:12:26] <aplund> right, but the rest of the line matches the other rules.  https://gist.github.com/aplund/40c655e05c41c7810bf80056e4e9f646
[02:12:50] <flatcap> the other rules don't get colour merging, yet
[02:12:50] <aplund> so my flagged backgrounds go black in the "color tree" bits.
[02:13:15] <aplund> oh.
[02:13:18] <flatcap> (it's on the todo list, but I have other things to fix first)
[02:14:08] <aplund> ok.

[18:44:29] <flatcap> gahr: urgh!  that zeroing code's been there since the initial commit
[18:46:45] <flatcap> tyler: config variables only hold one value, so to manage multiple accounts you need to use `account-hook`s...
[18:46:53] <flatcap> account-hook imaps://example.org 'set ...'
[18:47:45] <flatcap> when you switch to, say, the yahoo account you want to set all the variables ($from, $smtp_url, ...)
[18:48:09] <flatcap> and it's important to *unset* any variables that might have been set for other accounts
[18:49:12] <gahr> flatcap: yeah
[18:49:48] <flatcap> it seems odd to be doing that sort of thing, these days

[18:51:53] <flatcap> hmm... no
[18:53:58] <flatcap> what about network filesystems?
[18:55:52] <flatcap> if you write a large file to disk, can you guarantee that it'll get written to disk *once*
[18:56:07] <flatcap> no dupes, no remapped blocks
[18:56:15] <flatcap> (I've no idea, I'm just guessing here)
[18:57:08] <Kinnison> You can't guarantee to have overwritten blocks like that
[18:57:18] <Kinnison> the storage device itself might remap things e.g. SSDs
[18:57:21] <flatcap> yeah
[18:57:35] <Kinnison> If you don't want it durable, don't commit it unencrypted to storage
[18:57:43] <flatcap> hehe, indeed
[18:58:11] <flatcap> writing 0s over the whole file might get "optimised" by the OS/filesystem
[18:58:22] <flatcap> and never actually written to disk
[19:00:48] <flatcap> as a modern-OS-user, I don't have the problem -- I have full-disk encryption and my /tmp is RAM

[19:11:42] <tyler> flatcap: of course i am using account-hook

[19:12:03] <gahr> so I was already against the TempAttachmentsList when it came up, IIRC

[19:20:15] <Kinnison> tyler: please don't do that kind of thing again.  Pastebins exist for a reason
[19:20:15] <flatcap> ok, that would have been more polite on pastebin -- just saying :-)
[19:20:31] <Kinnison> tyler: FYI, paste.rs/web is a reasonable pastebin to use
[19:20:42] <tyler> set edit_headers=yes is making me available to change the from filed. this is how i am using it.
[19:21:36] <tyler> Kinnison: Ohh, i see. Okay will do it next time. Sorry but i am not really familiar with this weechat yet...
[19:22:25] <Kinnison> Everyone's allowed to make the mistake once :D
[19:22:31] <flatcap> in your config, do shouldn't need to source the acount configs manually.  the folder-hooks should do that as required
[19:22:35] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o flatcap
[19:22:41] <flatcap> yes once
[19:22:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o flatcap
[19:23:04] <gahr> :)
[19:23:43] <tyler> flatcap: Hmmm, so folder-hooks should be enough to source the particular account then??
[19:24:07] <tyler> I did not know about it

[19:24:48] <Kinnison> folder-hook says "When you enter a folder matching the pattern, run this command"
[19:24:59] <Kinnison> so if the command to run is `source ...` that's what'll run when the hook fires
[19:26:02] <tyler> Kinnison: Ok. I am just confused the difference btwn account-hook and folder-hook now.
[19:26:45] *** Quits: axelrod (~axelrod@user/axelrod) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:26:49] <Kinnison> account-hook is for *remote* mailboxes, IIRC
[19:27:00] * Kinnison only uses neomutt against local Maildirs
[19:28:46] <flatcap> the account-hook fires when you change accounts
[19:28:47] <tyler> Ok. I have not set up neomutt for local Maildirs yet. Only using remote access. Just via IMAP
[19:28:48] <flatcap> all maildirs are considered a single local account
[19:29:12] <flatcap> but if you switch from imap to maildir, or vice versa, it should fire (I hope)
[19:29:30] * Kinnison values offline access to email too much to have learned the imap-in-neomutt ways :D
[19:29:41] <flatcap> :-)
[19:30:56] <tyler> :)
[19:30:59] <tyler> Thait is ok
[19:31:41] <tyler> First i just want to get familiar with online access. The next step will be offline. :)
[19:56:10] <tyler> See ya later & thanks for help
[19:57:53] <flatcap> bye,np
