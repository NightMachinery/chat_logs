[01:46:06] <Rider99> I'm confused how they find x. Isn't it wrong to equate a "weight percentage (wt%)" to "grams per mole" as I think they have done here https://imgur.com/a/9bLJmmJ in the 0.1C: xCO2, 12C:44CO2 step? Does anyone get what they have done here ? I think it has all the context you need
[01:48:23] <nomagno> Say I have a bit string (0001011101010011...) that is completely random. What is the simplest pattern to look for in four-bit chunks that has 75% to match?

[03:00:16] <zeroc00l0> I thought maybe I could build some polynomial with the numerator as one of the coefficients and with more roots (mod p) than degrees, then it would follow that p divides the numerator, but I haven't been able to do this.  And I messed around with Wilson's Theorem a bit to no avail.  Please help me.

[03:35:42] <somiaj> nomagno: that isn't correct. The longer the string is, the higher the probability of seeing a string of n zeros in a row is. Similar issue with say a fair coin, the more flips you do, the higher chance of seeing a string of 6 heads in a row. This is actually a good test of randomness, in long bit strings, there is a much higher probabilty of seeing a sub string of n zeros in a row.
[03:37:36] <somiaj> So even though each bit has a 50% chance of being zero or one, the longer the string is, the higher chance of seeing a sub string of all zeros.

[09:16:11] <PlanckWalk> It really depends upon what information you want out of the result.
[09:16:41] <PlanckWalk> The most straightforward for just "comparing with par" is to add up the probabilities of winning and compare with actual number of wins.
[09:18:25] <PlanckWalk> In your case that adds up to 7.32 expected wins, compared with 5 actual.  There is always some variation expected, of course.
[09:18:38] <PlanckWalk> You can also add up variances to see how that comapres...
[09:20:45] <PlanckWalk> The sum of variances is 2.149, for a standard deviation of ~1.5. So a 2 standard deviation range would be about 4 to 10.
[09:21:21] <PlanckWalk> So 5 wins is lower than average, but not so low that something other than random chance is required to explain it.

[09:23:35] <PlanckWalk> This is just rough estimation.  You can get more accurate (but not necessarily more useful) bounds by calculating exact cumulative probabilities.
[09:24:09] <PlanckWalk> It's also about a thousand times more work to calculate the exact probabilities, e.g. suitable for a computer.

[11:11:33] <greenbagels> its simpler than you're making it out to be
[11:11:53] <greenbagels> start at line 2, (x^4)^(1/3) * (x^5)^(1/4)
[11:12:08] <greenbagels> you can simplify each of these using exponent laws to get x^(4/3) * x^(5/4)
[11:12:25] <greenbagels> from here, addition of fractions should help you simplify
[11:13:22] <Xardas> hhhhh why didn't this cross my mind
[11:13:27] <Xardas> You're right
[11:13:33] <greenbagels> as to where you had a mistake in your algebra, when moving between the last two lines, (x^4)^(7/12) should have become x^(7/3), not x^(7/4)
[11:13:48] <greenbagels> otherwise you would have gotten the right answer still :)
[11:14:16] <greenbagels> Xardas: its ok, it wasn't a waste of effort or anything; the fact that you did all the manipulation still lets you practice exponent rules
[11:14:31] <greenbagels> it just gave you more chances to make a small error :)

[13:26:54] <audiobirb> it is 0
[13:26:57] <energizer> audiobirb: 2x at x=0 is 2*0 = 0
[13:27:00] <Svitkona> sure, and x is 0 there
[13:27:07] <audiobirb> o
[13:27:12] <Svitkona> the derivative gives you the slope of the tangent line, not the tangent line itself
[13:27:21] <audiobirb> well that makes sense then
[13:28:06] <int-e> Yeah the tangent at (t, f(t)) is given by x = (x-t) f'(t) + f(t).

[19:20:53] <greenbagels> Also why do you ask about the area thing? Are you reading about riemann integration?
[19:21:00] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4decd.access.ecotel.net)
[19:21:39] <Matt|home> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Uw1SXPW7s <-- they used finding the area under the curve of the function line as an example of what you'd use integration for
[19:21:53] <Matt|home> but it's just an approximation. you can find exact curved areas no?
[19:21:55] <greenbagels> Summation you mean?
[19:22:02] <Matt|home> sure
[19:22:13] <Matt|home> im skipping ahead a few chapters here, i just wanted to see how difficult it'd be
[19:22:50] <greenbagels> Ok so a finite sum like this is an approximation
[19:22:54] <Matt|home> "The basic idea of Integral calculus is finding the area under a curve. To find it exactly, we can divide the area into infinite rectangles of infinitely small width and sum their areasÑcalculus is great for working with infinite things! This idea is actually quite rich, and it's also tightly related to Differential calculus, as you will see in the upcoming videos."
[19:23:10] <Galois> here's a secret. When dealing with real numbers, EVERYTHING is an approximation
[19:23:10] <greenbagels> But the riemann integral is an infinite limit of these sums, in a certain sense
[19:23:14] <Matt|home> ..
[19:23:27] <Matt|home> so i guess this is the easiest method to do it?
[19:23:31] <joel135> gurkenglas: some of the axioms make sure that the inner product forms a tensor, so in that sense yes, since tensor network diagrams require tensors. also positive definiteness is one way of ensuring that the cup that is the inner product has a corresponding cap, although a cap only requires invertibility (except in numerical situations where positive definiteness is perhaps practically necessary).
[19:23:40] <Galois> for example you think the area of that circle is pi? Well, good luck computing pi without approximations.
[19:23:53] <greenbagels> Matt|home: there are plenty of curved shapes we can find the area of if they are nice enough
[19:24:09] <bildramer> you should distinguish approximation and limits
[19:24:17] <greenbagels> But this is far from the amount of things we can use integration to calculate the areas of
[19:24:34] <bildramer> numerically, you can get pretty close, and there's also math to describe how to ensure you got close
[19:24:39] <mefistofeles> Matt|home: also, not very useful if you have an indefinite integral
[19:24:49] <Z-module> greenbagels: The only ones are cyclics of prime-power order, and (for each prime p) the Pruefer group Z_{p^infty}, which is just the p-component of Q/Z. Another way to say it is that G has a linearly ordered subgroup lattice iff G embeds in some Pruefer group.
[19:24:52] <bildramer> but there are also procedures to get exact results starting from exact inputs
[19:24:59] <Matt|home> gotcha
[19:25:08] <Matt|home> but that's all integration is, finding areas of curved objects?
[19:25:15] <mefistofeles> Matt|home: no
[19:25:17] <greenbagels> Z-module: never heard of pruefer groups, ill have to read up on this
[19:25:54] <bildramer> you can integrate things that you wouldn't really describe as "areas" in the end (integrating a vector field around a curve or something) - but basically, that's it, yeah

[19:28:21] <bildramer> many physics simulations are basically integration, as well. if you plot force, then the area is velocity gained, then integrating that gives you position, and force depends on position, for example - numerically you can take a small value like 0.01, do hundreds of those steps, and it won't look half bad
[19:29:14] <bildramer> it's an approximation of differential equations but it's easier to grasp than the theory, sometimes
[19:30:00] <bildramer> but studying the theory will let you do much better (something that looks arcane and incomprehensible like RK4)
[19:30:02] <mefistofeles> bildramer: that doesn't work for most systems in physics, though
[19:30:08] <mefistofeles> only for the simplest ones

[21:54:37] <gurkenglas> isekaijin: otherwise we don't get complex numbers! i expect there to be some elegant reason for this, because the analogy is too coincidental.
[21:54:52] <isekaijin> Well, why do you want to get complex numbers in the first place?
[21:55:04] <isekaijin> I'm totally fine with just getting \bar{Z}.
[21:55:17] <gurkenglas> I don't know! I asked some dude "why complex numbers" today and our flailing led me to that realization.
[21:55:52] <Z-module> "Because rotations."

[21:56:04] <isekaijin> Why complex numbers? I think the most compelling reason is that they provide a natural tool for studying periodic phenomena.
[21:56:25] <gurkenglas> can you derive this tool, rather than starting with it and then demonstrating its usefulness?

[21:57:40] <isekaijin> It's a combination of two factors. If we just want to study periodic phenomena in a purely algebraic setting, then \bar{Q} should just as good as C, because the roots of unity are already in \bar{Q}.
[21:58:07] <isekaijin> But of course we want to study *smooth* or at least *piecewise smooth* periodic phenomena.
[21:58:34] <gurkenglas> can't you do smooth functions in Qbar as well?
[21:59:09] <dude12312414> gurkenglas: one way to understand C is, we are interested in operations that do rotation and scaling, but we want to treat them as numbers, as similar as possible to R
[22:00:02] <isekaijin> gurkenglas: In \bar{Q}, you don't even have the exponential function, which is absolutely necessary for solving linear ODE systems with constant coefficients - the most fundamental kind of ODE that exists,
[22:01:04] <gurkenglas> alright so can you take the hull not under roots of polynomials but under solutions to differential equations?
[22:01:08] <isekaijin> gurkenglas: We need the real numbers and smooth functions to be able to apply math to the physical world. That's where algebra isn't enough.
[22:01:30] <gurkenglas> that should still be countable.
[22:02:28] <dude12312414> you could also view C as an algebra of 2x2 matrices over R (the rotation & scaling matrices) but then you are working with 4 real numbers, two of which are redundant
[22:02:35] <isekaijin> gurkenglas: Yes, there's a concept of “differential algebra”. You start with polynomial rings, and then adjoin solutions of ODEs, just like in field theory you start with (scalar) fields and adjoin solutions of polynomial equations.

[22:03:48] <isekaijin> gurkenglas: But I think algebra alone still doesn't model adequately the situation where a physical quantity is only known up to a certain precision.
[22:04:10] <gurkenglas> Neat. so you have R or some countable variant of it, and want to study smooth periodic processes. Whence complex numbers?
[22:04:27] <isekaijin> As I said, to study periodic phenomena, we need the roots of 1.
[22:04:54] <gurkenglas> roots of unity sounds like my original analogy!
[22:05:14] <isekaijin> It was worded rather imprecisely.
[22:05:36] <dude12312414> and then you realize that you can actually express all such matrices as linear combinations (over R) of two special matrices, the identity matrix and the 90 degree rotation matrix. The identity matrix becomes 1 and the 90 deg rotation matrix becomes i
[22:05:37] <isekaijin> For example, you never specified that, in one case, the starting point was Z, and in the other case, the starting point was R.

[22:06:56] <isekaijin> I think the key is that, addition in R doesn't help us study periodic phenomena because, well, the additive groups of Z, Q, R, C have no torsion elements.
