[04:49:58] <Joanna> jan6: the reason irc is allowed to exist is because our conversations here aren’t really changing anything.
[04:51:49] <Joanna> Irc is a marginalized nearly abandoned form of communication. However they still send trolls and spammers to try to destroy what is left of the irc community.

[14:44:47] <Joanna> Allowing us to talk freely gives data to harvest. Whenever they get tired of harvesting data I imagine it will be a lot more difficult to talk on internet.

[23:48:50] <jan6>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrE4f3CaKaw the secret code was SUPER tiny numbers hidden in the normalmaps of floor textures...which is a pretty dang great way to hide info, because they're so small you don't even see them, not even with texture editor/viewer programs, without zooming in (and possibly changing contrast and stuff to make easier to view)
[23:52:36] <jan6> this kind of "hidden in plain view, as long as you view exactly the right spot of a specific texture" seems pretty great way to hide info, without actually using encryption or ciphers or anything, and of course could be used with other stuff too, such as normal paper, or whatever, as there's just no reason for anyone to go combing through literally every single texture/whatever to look if MAYBE
[23:52:37] <jan6> there's something there
[23:54:00] <jan6> and it doesn't even have the "suspicious" or "trackable" properties of stuff like inserting arbitrary data into image files (be it weird bit patterns, or stuffing it into off-display bits, or simply putting it before/after image so it's ignored by image viewer)
[23:54:10] <jan6> since it's just a normal image
