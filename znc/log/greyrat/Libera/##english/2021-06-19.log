[17:02:38] <pussipupu> is that up or flatter space-time
[17:02:55] <kurahaupo> hmm, all the interesting bits about the meanings of "up" would be in the "preposition" section; get up, put up, wake up, shake up, set up (1), set up (2), make up (n), make up (v), 
[17:02:56] <pussipupu> though they're often the same direction
[17:03:52] <kurahaupo> pussipupu: for them NOT to be in the same direction would suggest a large negative mass nearby. So far we haven't even found small negative masses, let alone large ones
[17:04:23] <pussipupu> well what do you keep in /your/ cellar?
[17:04:31] <anrom> Up is a 2009 movie by Pixar.

[17:05:05] <kurahaupo> pussipupu: I live 8 floors above ground level. Where's my cellar?
[17:05:28] <pussipupu> Downstairs neighbors' flat I guess?
[17:05:58] <pussipupu> Though when we lived in a flat we had a share of the building's bomb shelter as our cellar
[17:06:01] <kurahaupo> In that case "I dunno, my key doesn't open that floor"
[17:06:28] <kurahaupo> Bomb shelter… which century was this?
[17:07:45] <pussipupu> Twenty first

[21:04:19] <huf> even so
[21:04:21] <m1dnight> that depends. an abstraction (in programming) that motivates a programmer to write bad code is a bad abstraction
[21:04:33] <twb> is there any other kind?
[21:04:34] <k_sze> Hi guys. There's this passage in Tolkien's "The Hobbit" that I can't quite parse: "It was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of this traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will."
[21:04:34] <m1dnight> if you have a properly designed abstraction it is used as it is intended to be used
[21:04:58] <k_sze> I'm puzzled about the "but that shall be accounted the promised share of this traitor".
[21:05:38] <twb> k_sze: urgh, Ye Olde english
[21:06:03] <huf> k_sze: bilbo was promised a fourteenth share of the treasure
[21:06:25] <huf> thorin is saying he'll pay that amount to the elves instead, to get the arkenstone back
[21:06:29] <huf> and bilbo gets nothing
[21:06:30] <k_sze> That's Thorin talking about giving part of the treasure hoard to the elves and the people of Lake-town because Bilbo secretly gave the Arkenstone to Bard.
[21:06:48] <k_sze> yes, I get the jest of the meaning.
[21:06:53] <twb> gist
[21:07:02] <twb> "jest" is a joke
[21:07:04] <k_sze> yes, late night typing isn't good.
[21:07:14] <huf> "promised share" is the 1/14th share promised to bilbo
[21:07:23] <huf> "this traitor" is bilbo
[21:07:24] <k_sze> yes, of course
[21:07:37] <huf> which part is unclear then?
[21:07:53] <k_sze> I mean, *grammatically*, I can't figure out what's the function of "the promised share".
[21:10:24] <k_sze> Because the verb preceding it is the passive voice "be accounted", so "the promised share" can't be a direct object. Is it the subject? If so, what's "that" doing before "be accounted"?
[21:10:42] <k_sze> You see what I mean?
[21:11:24] <huf> it's probably a bit archaic
[21:11:31] <huf> or pompous phrasing PLUS archaic
[21:11:40] <huf> would be a good fit for thorin
[21:11:41] <huf> dunno
[21:11:45] <huf> it doesnt seem that weird to me
[21:12:43] <huf> "that shall be accounted as the promised share" maybe?
[21:13:09] <k_sze> let me check whether this is a printing mistake. Googling.
[21:13:50] <huf> I dont think we use the verb "account" in this sense anymore
[21:16:30] <anrom> Would "one fourteenth share" be the object?
[21:19:25] <anrom> What is "a gift" in the sentence "I gave him a gift"?
[21:20:15] <pp4mnk> present?
[21:21:00] <k_sze> huf, I'm starting to think that it is written in subjunctive.
[21:21:35] <huf> I generally just shrug and move on :)
[21:21:48] <huf> there are too many odd grammatical constructs in tolkien to stop at each one
[21:21:55] <k_sze> the "that" being the opening conjunction.
[21:22:31] <k_sze> subjunctive in the sense of expressing an order or a wish.
[21:23:45] <k_sze> I think it's properly called "mandative subjunctive"?
[21:26:55] <exvicesindaco> k_sze im reading "lo hobbit" too
[21:27:18] <huf> lo?
[21:27:45] <exvicesindaco> the*

[21:28:07] <exvicesindaco> in eng
[21:28:11] <huf> good, good
[21:29:12] <exvicesindaco> some times i compare some phrases with italian book
[21:29:29] <huf> the original .hu translation of the hobbit translated the word hobbit
[21:29:30] <huf> to babó
[21:29:31] <exvicesindaco> when they are too much difficult
[21:29:33] <huf> terrible decision
[21:30:13] <exvicesindaco> which language?
[21:30:21] <huf> hungarian
[21:30:38] <huf> the LOTR translation is better but still not as good as the original
[21:30:38] <exvicesindaco> ah ok
[21:31:17] <anrom> What's babó then?
[21:31:26] <huf> "hobbit"
[21:31:53] <huf> it's a made up word like hobbit
[21:31:58] <huf> just unnecessary and ugly sounding
[21:32:16] <anrom> Okay, I thought it was an already existing word.
[21:32:53] <anrom> In Finnish it's "hobitti", at least that makes sense.
[21:33:17] <huf> here it's a nice back-harmonizing word
[21:33:31] <huf> pronounced with a double b of course :)
[21:33:36] <twb> is "hobbit" made up?
[21:33:51] <twb> Ah it existed already but was repurposed
[21:34:21] <twb> I was thining of "homunculus"
[21:34:32] <huf> our lotr translation tried to translate "elf" too
[21:34:42] <huf> since we havent got a word for it, he made one up
[21:34:53] <huf> well, made one up based on the word for fairy
[21:35:44] <huf> tünde was a much better attempt than the other guy's babó :)
[21:37:19] <huf> the brandywine river's translation required some cleverness too, since it has to mean something boozy but also sound a bit like baranduin
[21:37:34] <huf> translating tolkien is hard...
[21:38:55] <twb> Honestly I find a lot of Tolkien to be dull
[21:38:55] <anrom> How did they translate Baggins?
[21:39:01] <huf> zsákos
[21:39:06] <twb> a combination of his style, and the fact that so much derivative work exists
[21:39:10] <huf> bag-haver, I guess?
[21:39:23] <huf> baggy?
[21:39:52] <huf> merry became trufa for some reason, I never understood that :D
[21:42:59] <pp4mnk> Baggins... Is it a hobbit look?
