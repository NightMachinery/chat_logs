[16:39:41] <fendor[m]> damn, the new vscode extension is going to be full on batteries included and will make sure you can't do anything wrong
[16:42:12] <fendor[m]> I think there might be one unintended consequence. If I use 8.8.4 by default, but I have manageGHC enabled, then HLS-wrapper will be launched with `ghcup ... --cabal latest --ghc recommended ...`. If I don't have a `--with-compiler` field in my cabal.project, cabal will always use the recommended ghc since it is the first one on the PATH, although I do have 8.8.4 installed. We might be fine with such a behaviour, but it is
[16:42:12] <fendor[m]> something to think about
[16:47:33] <komikat> interesting
[16:48:38] <maerwald[m]> fendor: https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/547/files#diff-6300b29e042762267f15748c5c6136cbedf8135e07a1881609a478404e1661baR272
[16:48:50] <maerwald[m]> That's an easy fix there

[21:40:30] <sm> hey all. ghcup tells me GHC 9.0.2 is not compatible with Haskell Language Server 1.6.1.0, is that still correct ?
[21:41:44] <maerwald> on M1?
[21:41:53] <sm> yes
[21:42:07] <maerwald> only 8.10.7 is supported there
[21:43:04] <sm> ok, thanks maerwald 
[21:44:11] <maerwald> I think 9.0 is busted on M1 anyway
[21:45:05] <maerwald> and 9.2.2 is busted on windows and not yet built for: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2771
