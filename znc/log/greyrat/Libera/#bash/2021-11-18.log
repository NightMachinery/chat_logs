[00:19:48] <Circuitsoft> Question about pipes: I know I can `a_program --infile <(generating_program)`. Is there a way to have the `<()` capture an fd other than 1?
[00:20:25] <twkm> like?
[00:20:26] <emanuele6>  >/dev/null 3>&1
[00:20:33] <Circuitsoft> Something like, maybe, `a_program --infile <3(generate_data --out /proc/self/fd/3)`?
[00:20:50] <emanuele6> err, the other way around
[00:21:07] <Circuitsoft> If I wanted to maintain STDOUT and STDERR to the subshell running `generate_data`
[00:21:07] <emanuele6> a_program --infile <3(generate_data --out /proc/self/fd/3 3>&1 >/dev/null)
[00:21:10] <twkm> redirection and process substitution are not combined.
[00:21:30] <emanuele6> without <3
[00:21:38] <twkm> 3< <(generator)
[00:21:46] <emanuele6> that also works
[00:22:52] <Circuitsoft> So `a_program --in 3<(generate_data --out /proc/self/fd/3)` will open a pipe with the writing end going to `fd3` on `generate_data`, and another fd passed in to `--in` on `a_program`?

[00:33:04] <Circuitsoft> `at` is its own program suite, so read the manpages for it. Basically, it's saying that, if you register an `at` job that's a bash one-liner, it'll be executed by /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash. If you still want to do a one-liner, you can `at +1day bash -c "my | bash | one-liner"`
[00:33:13] <emanuele6> you can add a shebang at the start of your file, but when you type a script for at, the first line you type will not be at the top of the generated script

[00:34:30] <greybot> GuiToris: The top of a script MUST have a #! line, called 'shebang' or 'hashbang'. It tells the kernel what program to run your script with.

[00:39:05] <twkm> the fuck we need the idiot stack when what happens was just quoted.  sheesh.
[00:39:25] <emanuele6> catern: it runs `exec cmd1' and `cmd2' in two separate subshells
[00:39:39] <emanuele6> in a pipeline, every command is run in a subshell
[00:39:57] <emanuele6> (unless lastpipe is on; in that case the last command is run in the main shell)
[00:40:21] <emanuele6> so the first shell runs `exec cmd1' which is basically the same as just running `cmd1'
[00:40:23] <knstn> What's up with those crazy quoting? It's my client or yours?
[00:40:33] <catern> emanuele6: I see! so it doesn't really do anything use "exec" in a pipeline like that? unless one has lastpipe on

[00:41:13] <knstn> I see a lot of `...'
[00:41:15] <emanuele6> if you have lastpipe on, it doesn't make much sense to use exec on the last command
[00:41:34] <emanuele6> knstn: yes, m4 quoting
[00:41:49] <catern> okay fair enough. so I'll go on to say "exec is useless in pipelines"
[00:41:56] <twkm> or on any except the command in a pipeline.
[00:42:10] <twkm> err, any except the last.
[00:42:37] <catern> what happens if it's on the last?
[00:42:47] <GuiToris> twkm, I typed 'at now +1 minute', wrote a couple of commands, ctrl+d, and where should I put 'exec'? or where should I have put it?
[00:42:49] <twkm> it replaces the current shell.
[00:42:53] <ormaaj> exec with redirect excepted
[00:42:57] <emanuele6> if you use it on the last with lastpipe on it would be cleaner to just write it as: exec cmd2 < <(cmd1)
[00:43:16] <twkm> probably the first line GuiToris.
[00:43:22] <lovetruth> Is there any parameter expansion that can tell if a filename (which name is stored in a variable) exists or not?...
[00:43:53] <twkm> parameter expansion, no.  test, yes.
[00:44:07] <twkm> [[ -f $var ]]
[00:44:10] <GuiToris> twkm, ok, I'll start it over. I'll type at now +1 minute, enter, exec in the first line enter and the rest of the commands?

[00:45:18] <twkm> GuiToris: once you read how to use exec, yes, first line is exec ..., then the rest of what you want done.
[00:45:23] <GuiToris> 'Replace the shell with the given command.' this doesn't mean to me anything
[00:45:31] <emanuele6> GuiToris: twkm was suggesting to use exec to write to redirect stdout to a log file

[00:49:11] <GuiToris> wow

[00:49:27] <GuiToris> this is exactly what I was looking for

[03:37:26] <e36freak> bash is a shell. it provides some commands internal to itself, without calling anything external

[04:44:32] <emanuele6> i graduated (electronics) high school 3.5 years ago and they had mostly windows xp pro PCs, but they also had older PCs in storage. they used to let me and two other classmates use the lab after school to help clean it so we played a bit with the old stuff hehe
[04:45:04] <WeedMan> so the 'command line' is just the line at the bottom (or top) of the screen for accepting user input, and that's within the terminal emulator, and the 'prompt' is something that came later in computing and simply displays the user signed in and the machine name
[04:45:06] <WeedMan> correct?
[04:45:42] <emanuele6> the command line is not a part of the terminal emulator, no
[04:45:50] <e36freak> i remember when xp was a hot new thing...
[04:46:19] <e36freak> yeah win 2k was HS, the old computers we played with ran DOS to 98
[04:46:53] <WeedMan> is the command line what you get without a terminal emulator?
[04:48:12] <e36freak> huh?
[04:51:07] <ormaaj> WeedMan videos are pretty hit and miss (mostly miss). Read some operating systems books for starters and do some programming around something that interests you. Probably the fastest way to get going on your own.

[04:58:18] <WeedMan> is the part I said about 'promp' correct though?

[04:59:31] <WeedMan> the prompt is something that came later in computing, and is just the little box displaying current user and machine name

[05:00:08] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[05:00:19] <e36freak> a "prompt" is just a thing that tells you the interface is ready for user input
[05:00:29] <emanuele6> e36freak: hehe
[05:00:44] <e36freak> so like the WeedMan@computer:~$ # thing or similar you see in bash
[05:00:46] <e36freak> that's the prompt
[05:00:54] <WeedMan> yeah that's what I mean
[05:01:10] <WeedMan> but the prompt isn't the whole line, right?
[05:01:19] <WeedMan> jest the part at the begning of the line?
[05:01:35] <e36freak> eh, you're splitting hairs with definitions, but it's the thing that's printed to let you know it's ready for the next command
[05:02:05] <e36freak> in this case PS1, which by default is user@hostname:directory$
[05:02:19] <emanuele6> i played zork some years ago on a z-machine emulator; i was using jzip. it's command line did not handle the delete key and the backspace key on my laptop was broken
[05:02:20] <ormaaj> yeah you don't really need to know that. It's configurable even.
[05:02:40] <e36freak> nobody's gonna care if that definition is spot on or not
[05:02:44] <e36freak> don't hyperfocus on that
[05:02:57] <WeedMan> but computers with display terminals never used-to have user@machine:-$

[05:03:03] <WeedMan> that's correct surely
[05:03:05] <e36freak> it could just be $
[05:03:16] <e36freak> or C:foo> in DOS

[05:03:44] <e36freak> it always printed something to let you know that it finished the last command and is ready for user input
[05:03:46] <emanuele6> so i used an expect script that converted the delete key to arrow right backspace
[05:03:48] <e36freak> what the exact string is doesn't matter
[05:04:18] <WeedMan> cool, I guess it doesn't really matter
[05:04:42] <emanuele6> and i also ended up implementing automatic save file reloading and some shortcuts to enter cardinal directions faster etc
[05:04:42] <e36freak> and you can change it to whatever you want on your machine

[05:11:38] <emanuele6> that is the best way

[05:12:52] <emanuele6> writing to a new file, and then overwriting the old file with the new one is the best way
[05:13:48] <emanuele6> some people use: printf '%s\n' "$(shuf filename)" > filename
[05:14:09] <emanuele6> you can use that if you don't care about trailing newlines being discarded
[05:14:34] <emanuele6> but using a secondary file instead of that is better

[15:17:35] <TJ-> Any shellcheck experts can explain this? In a function I've a "local -i split" always treated as an integer. There are 4 calls that pass $split (or a value calculated from it) to other functions. When the 1st call has $((split++))) the next 2 calls with $split generate SC2086 (double-quote) but if the 1st call has $((split + 1)) that warning isn't generated. Is this a shellcheck issue or am I missing

[15:20:27] <bud> my guess is that the variable is declared as an integer, but a function can only "recieve" string arguments.
[15:20:55] *** Joins: rcernin_ (~rcernin@124.190.139.235)
[15:21:12] <TJ-> bud: I've used the same concepts in multiple other functions without an issue; it only seems to trigger when using prefix/postfix operators on the variable
[15:21:12] <geirha> it'll still be subjected to word-splitting, with or without -i, hence why you should quote
[15:21:40] <bud> yeah
[15:21:43] <TJ-> geirha: shellcheck is fine when the value is always treated arithmetically in every situation
[15:21:52] <ormaaj> i would not expect a static analyzer to follow all that
[15:21:55] <TJ-> just this one seems wierd
[15:22:20] <geirha> TJ-: the one it complained about is the only one where word-splitting will be attempted, as far as I can tell
[15:22:58] <TJ-> ormaaj: well, it's being doing well at it, I've been removing quotes througout an then reducing all the SC2086 warnings but this pre/postfix just seems 'strange'
[15:23:15] <bud> also, if you do declare -i, you don't need to do $(())
[15:23:31] <TJ-> bud where?
[15:23:34] <bud> have to do
[15:23:35] <geirha> in general it's best to not use -i at all, because it doesn't really add any benefit
[15:23:58] <TJ-> bud you mean for local -i x=$(( $1 )) type of thing/
[15:24:03] <ormaaj> removing all the -i would be easiest.
[15:24:04] <bud> well, it gives you an error if it for some reason is set to a string

[16:48:02] <razend> I want to download the ones form the list
[16:48:08] <razend> only
[16:48:44] <gnoo> razend: does the file contain directory path or file path? like folder/ or folder/img.jpg?
[16:48:49] <emanuele6> i am a little surprised that bash doesn't let you use ${par/$pat} with pat=/1 since the manual says that the leading /, #, % is part of the pattern
[16:50:06] <razend> echo "$(cat images.txt | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')" will output all the images with comma separator and magic expansion will lead download one by one. But the problem with this approach is, it will download all the images in the single folder

[22:29:59] <emanuele6> that is not the only thing that you are not quoting

[23:34:27] <ghoti> emanuele6: how do I know that COMPREPLY is being populated? Because if I just type "ssh " and hit tab, I see a list of all my targets. And I added a debug line to send array contents to stderr. http://sprunge.us/4JQ8gK
[23:34:55] <emanuele6> then what is the issue?
[23:35:33] <ghoti> If I type "ssh i" and hit tab, I'm expecting to see just the hosts that begin with an i, and if there is only one, I'm expecting my command line to be completed with that host.
[23:36:30] <ghoti> Instead, if I type "ssh i" and hit tab, I get the complete list of hosts.
[23:36:31] <emanuele6> no, that is not how it works
[23:37:52] <emanuele6> you need to check the current COMP_WORDS, etc. to populate COMPREPLY with just the elements that you want to have as a completion option

[23:49:34] <ghoti> Ah, shellcheck doesn't warn abot it.
[23:50:01] <emanuele6> because if it were an associative array, you would need the substitution
[23:50:05] <ghoti> Thanks, yes, I usually try to avoid unnecessary variables.
[23:50:09] <emanuele6> and shellcheck doesn't keep track of that
