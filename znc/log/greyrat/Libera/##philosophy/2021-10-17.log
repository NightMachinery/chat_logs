[16:11:18] <darklambda> spent modding my guitar just a while ago.. my first time to use locking tuners... i had the wrong impression.. it's an oxymoron.. haha
[16:11:45] <arryana> ooh
[16:11:47] <darklambda> they don't lock the tuning at all.. they just make changing strings easy.. and turning the pegs more granular..
[16:11:57] * arryana nods
[16:12:09] <arryana> my other half plays guitar and bass
[16:12:09] <darklambda> so it's more stable for you when you tune the instrument
[16:12:17] <arryana> there's a -lot- of that stuff around the house
[16:12:39] <darklambda> i guess lessons learn.. wrong impression.. but i appreciate it's help.. so no regrets installing it
[16:12:52] <arryana> i envy musical ability
[16:13:07] <darklambda> you can always learn if you want to :-)
[16:13:17] <arryana> I've tried quite a few times

[16:14:10] <arryana> I've got a 3/4 size acoustic here for the days i feel optimistic about learning

[18:35:57] <darklambda> exploring mod duo x currently (effects unit)
[18:37:12] <amigojapan> darklambda: I have always been curious why certain cords are certain combinations of strings that seem arbitrary and why they go along well with some notes
[18:38:07] <darklambda> harmony :-)
[18:38:50] <darklambda> like some are 5th of the fundamental... or octave (double the frequency)... it's an overtone play i guess
[18:39:58] <darklambda> and some of those combinations make them vibrate more together perhaps.. which results in a nice sound or feeling
[18:40:08] <darklambda> there's also dissonance... but it's an art

[18:46:27] <darklambda> using ears  is another level
[18:46:34] <amigojapan> Yeah
[18:46:47] <darklambda> but i guess people went the visual way so more people can do the job perhaps
[18:47:41] <amigojapan> darklambda: there are very few normal pianos now. My dad's business was not good
[18:48:06] <darklambda> i guess those must be very expensive pianos
[18:48:12] <amigojapan> Because of electronics pianos
[18:48:13] <darklambda> like antiques
[18:48:59] <amigojapan> They still make wooden pianos, but not sure who buys them. My dad sure did not know
[18:49:01] <darklambda> electroic pianos/keyboards .. nowadays, are quite versatile.. and more pratical in terms of music production.. can connect to computer easily.. with midi and stuff
[18:50:01] <darklambda> like for portability, i use my korg nanokey 2.. it's smaller than a computer keyboard.. and can do piano stuff can always shift octave if need the hight or lower keys...
[18:50:17] <darklambda> but 88keys is perhaps needed if one is doing classical stuff
[18:50:20] <amigojapan> darklambda: my dad worked for Steinway in his youth. In the factory. He learned everything about fixing pianos there
[18:50:25] <pussipupu> Modern keyboards can be good but even the really expensive ones can't really replace a piano
[18:50:33] <darklambda> but for music prod, 25keys is usually more than enough
[18:50:58] <pussipupu> I'm always slightly jelly of my mum's piano which is also an excellent midi keyboard
[18:51:13] <darklambda> yup... can replace the feel and stuff... but with the advent of high grade samples and VSTs.. sound is almost indistinguishable
[18:51:52] <darklambda> wow.. Steinway
[18:52:01] <darklambda> i think that's one of the top
[18:52:08] <amigojapan> Yeah

[18:54:17] <amigojapan> darklambda: probably staying at Steinway would have been better for business for my dad, but he was too adventurous, and went to visit Mexico where he met my mom and ended up living
[18:54:50] <darklambda> well.. what is life without love
[18:54:52] <darklambda> :-)
[18:54:59] <pussipupu> I'd love a piano to be honest, but I don't have the money or temperature stable space

[21:00:18] <Digit> [moan] ugh.  the hostile certainty of naive realism's arrogance... *exhasperated sigh*.  so prickly deafening sometimes.  [/moan]
[21:02:03] <causative> what exactly are you calling "naive realism"? this?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism nobody holds this view
[21:02:03] <ro-bot-o> [url] Naïve realism - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[21:02:33] <causative> no modern person believes that the senses provide direct evidence of things as they really are
[21:03:38] <causative> everybody understands that there are many layers of indirection between the object and the perception of the object: first the photons come off the object, then they enter the eye and are focused, then the retina does a lot of processing, then the visual cortex does more processing

[21:20:21] <causative> like, the eye often perceives objects as blurry. Naive realism would seem to imply that this means the real objects are blurry. That doesn't make sense.
