[03:06:07] <Panther> Once you become aware of an opportunity to score a reward, your brain squirts out dopamine to tell us that this indeed is the droid we’re looking for.
[03:09:49] <Panther> The dopamine problems don’t end here, either. Research shows that the dopamine release triggered by one promise of reward makes us more likely to pursue others. Look at pictures of naked women and you’re more likely to make risky financial decisions. Dream about striking it rich, and food can become really appetizing. This is especially problematic in today’s modern world, which in many 
[03:09:50] <Panther> ways is literally engineered to keep us always wanting more.
[03:10:58] <Panther> Video game makers carefully craft experiences that can elevate dopamine to amphetamine like levels, which explains a lot of the obsessive-compulsive behavior seen in gaming.

[05:21:13] <four> Well, that's the plan, but I only just got one! So far I'm all pads and buttons, circuit, OP-1, and Behringer Crave's.
[05:21:30] <four> I felt the need for some half-decent keys, even if they're aren't many of them on the Xm!
[05:21:37] <four> I can always get a nice midi-keyboard.
[05:21:54] <four> Apparently the USB midi on the Jupiter does host-mode too!
[05:22:28] <piercedwater-> oic. that stuff is beyond me...there's quite a few people in here that do that sort of thing
[05:22:40] <piercedwater-> producers and what not
[05:23:10] <four> Well, I'm just straight up amateur! But I really like the idea of staying DAW-less.
[05:23:40] <morlog> host mode means that you can connect other midi devices directly to it without needing a computer
[05:23:49] <piercedwater-> i've seen a few of the price tags on some of the DAWs...*whistles*
[05:24:10] <MusicalDillo> ooooh, morlog knows about MIDI :)
[05:24:21] <morlog> yeah
[05:24:34] <morlog> it's been around since the 80's

[05:24:54] <MusicalDillo> been using it since 1985 with a SX-64 portable
[05:25:21] <four> OP-1 is mostly for noodling around, it's like an all-in-one device, surprising powerful, but has its limits.
[05:25:32] <morlog> you can hook your op-1 up to the Jupiter and controll it from there
[05:25:44] <morlog> with the host mode
[05:25:58] <four> Yup! I was shocked when I realized the Jupiter did host mode, this will be very entertaining! :)
[05:26:13] <morlog> that sounds really nice
[05:26:56] <four> Aye, I mostly just got it for the multi-timbral and half-decent (although small size/number) keys.. so learning about host-mode was an awesome bonus!

[22:48:12] <artao> that's me restricting myself
[22:48:16] <macrobat> oh, gingerbread dough on sale, and I get a useful plastic box. luxury
[22:48:35] <artao> lol
[22:49:05] <artao> bowie is quite dead
[22:49:15] <artao> pirate his music, don't buy it
[22:49:23] <artao> fuck the music industry
[22:49:34] <macrobat> will u pirate his fashion?
[22:50:32] <artao> LOL which fashion? he was all over the place
[22:50:35] <artao> also ......... no
[22:50:47] <artao> i'm a "whatever's comfy" person
[22:50:51] <artao> couldn't care less
[22:51:28] <artao> as musicians (those of us who are) we should be pissed at the music industry
[22:51:39] <artao> Stimming put it very well
[22:51:56] <artao> we are giving record companies THE PRIVILEGE of publishing our music
[22:52:10] <artao> but they makes us feel like it's a privilege to be published
[22:52:22] <macrobat> too many want to be famous
[22:52:24] <artao> i know i feel like it's even a privilege to get listened to at all
[22:52:30] <artao> famous? bah
[22:52:42] <artao> just make a decent living i think is most artists
[22:52:58] <artao> sure ... famous is a common ... dream/fantasay
[22:53:13] <artao> but do you REALLY want fame and all the insanity that comes with it?
[22:53:16] <artao> me? no
[22:53:18] <artao> fuck that shit
[22:54:08] <artao> GAH
[22:54:31] <artao> if only this Beauty could re-assure her Geek regarding jumping into water from 20+ ft
[22:54:34] <artao> easy peasy
[22:54:58] <artao> no problem as long as you break the surface tension
[22:55:21] <artao> "make a hole" so to speak
[22:55:22] <macrobat> 6m? survivable if you mess up
[22:55:46] <artao> 6m is  ...
[22:55:47] <artao> yeah
[22:56:00] <artao> heck! you can take that on fucking concrete if you do it right
[22:56:19] <artao> 6m isn't even 20ft right?
[22:56:38] <artao> as a kid i jumped off rooves and out of trees to like 30ft and was fine
[22:56:40] <artao> roll
[22:56:57] <artao> redirect the momentum from vertical to horizontal
[22:57:05] <artao> fold and roll
[22:57:23] <artao> resist the urge to try to catch yourself with either legs or arms
[22:57:27] <artao> especially arms tho
[22:57:35] <artao> that's a broken collarbone
[22:58:03] <artao> learing how to fall properly is more ..... remembering how
[22:58:08] <artao> just like with swimming
[22:58:18] <artao> we instinctively know how
[22:58:31] <artao> from birth ....... then we forget as we grow older
[22:58:43] <Panther> like squatting
[22:58:58] <artao> babies also naturally exist in wei wu wei
[22:59:09] <artao> SUPER hard to do as a grown up
[22:59:20] <artao> Panther ... no
[22:59:27] <Panther> Babies will squat down to pick things up, but many adults bend at the back.
[22:59:38] <Panther> Or the hips
[22:59:43] <artao> squatting (i assume you mean shelter) is a learned skill
[22:59:46] <Panther> Hips = better
[22:59:48] <artao> OH
[22:59:49] <artao> okay
[22:59:51] <artao> that. yeah
[23:00:04] <artao> why do asians maintain that ability so well?
[23:00:07] <artao> well ... duh
[23:00:17] <artao> they also maintain the others better
[23:00:32] <artao> it's philosophical. taoism, buddhilsm, animism ...
[23:00:46] <Panther> Maybe consistent physical education that stresses proper movements.
[23:00:51] <artao> i lean towards taoism out of any "organized" religion
[23:01:18] <artao> but just the basic lao tzu and chuang tzu ... not of that religious mystical bs
[23:01:36] <artao> indeed Panther
[23:01:37] <artao> indeed

[23:02:02] <LibertyDillo> sounds like a good attitude, artao

[23:06:01] <artao> lol
[23:06:22] <artao> offensive humor is meant to be offensive, which is what makes it funny
[23:06:49] <artao> for a lot of people that can be hard to wrap their knee-jerk-reaction minds around

[23:09:14] <artao> as i said, i don't. not even close
[23:09:37] <artao> but also remember: IRC is my primary social contact ... as pathetic as that is
[23:10:00] <artao> and again. trust me ... this isn't NEARLY everything
[23:10:13] <artao> you'd explode if i did that lol
[23:10:39] <artao> there's usually at least 3 to 5 people talking in my head at once
[23:10:42] <artao> all the time
[23:10:45] <artao> ALL the time

[23:13:01] <LibertyDillo> keeps it simple
[23:13:18] <artao> this, email, ftp, and telnet
[23:13:34] <artao> then wais, gopher, archie, usenet, etc
[23:14:03] <Panther> uucp
[23:14:10] <artao> i fondly remember telnetting and ftp-ing in the 90s
[23:14:24] <artao> isn't that a protocol rather than an .... app
[23:14:28] * Panther ftp'd yesterday.
[23:14:44] <artao> :O
[23:14:45] <artao> wow
[23:14:51] <artao> idr when i last did
[23:14:55] <artao> nor telnet
[23:15:07] <LibertyDillo> I use FTP all the time for file storage
[23:15:14] <artao> cool
[23:15:23] <artao> i suppose web devs use it fairly often

[23:15:55] <artao> ahhh :)
[23:16:02] <artao> wow
[23:16:41] <Panther> I remember using that for the LIMS lab management system.
[23:16:57] <artao> multiple telnets across many universities until we found somewhere with software we wanted, then ftp-ing it backwards to us
[23:17:11] <artao> thankfully on university T1 lines

[23:18:14] <artao> me either, but used some
[23:18:21] <Panther> Just like a website, I really didn't have anything to put on one.
[23:18:26] <artao> but only on other people's computers :(

[23:24:47] <Panther> Only the super-user may use this option with zero interval. 
[23:24:50] * Panther smiles
[23:25:03] <Panther> Essentially, it sends the packets out as fast as it can.
[23:25:14] <Panther> f = flood :)
[23:25:15] <artao> i used to always carry around this nice little book of unix commands and their parameters
[23:25:21] <artao> ah. mk
[23:25:28] <artao> so no delays in printout
[23:26:30] <artao> i see no difference
[23:26:44] <artao> upon pinging google.com
[23:27:44] <Panther> I am sure they are not going to allow you to flood them with pings.
[23:28:04] <Panther> Across a WAN, you run into all kinds of congestion controls, anyway.
[23:28:11] <artao> heh ... fair point
[23:28:21] <artao> windows cli only does 3
[23:29:15] <artao> or maybe i should try it in cygwin
[23:29:18] <artao> lol
[23:29:20] <artao> no
[23:29:40] <artao> i forget what software requires it, but dependency is the only reason i have it installed

[23:32:21] <artao> sweet
[23:32:28] <artao> now try BeOS
[23:32:30] <artao> heh
[23:32:34] <Panther> Well.. every one after I started using them... I never tried to get one to run on a VAX/VMS for example.
[23:32:35] <artao> obviously you can
[23:34:18] <artao> i always wanted to use vaxvms but really never had the opportunity
[23:34:32] <artao> just a simple one that i'm not even sure WAS vaxvms
[23:34:57] <artao> vaxvms is time-sharing tho, not true multi-user
[23:34:59] <artao> right?
[23:36:25] <artao> it seemed to respond to some of the commands in the book i had tho
[23:36:45] <artao> is vaxvms even a thing anymore? <looks it up>
[23:37:28] <Panther> I only used one to control a scientific instrument, so I had to know the basics of how to run and somewhat admin it, but that was also a long time ago.
[23:38:06] <artao> meh. not enuf interest nor attention span to do the research
[23:38:13] <artao> jesus!
[23:38:18] <artao> how old are you again? LOL

[23:39:40] <artao> i see
[23:40:36] <Panther> Instead of scanning by changing the field in an electromagnet, this calculates the mass by how long it takes from desorption to detection, basically.
[23:40:37] <artao> all i really know about mass spectrometers is that they're used to identify what a material sample is composed of
[23:40:49] <artao> ah. mk
[23:40:56] <artao> that actually makes sense. thx

[23:44:45] <artao> anything serious?
[23:44:51] <artao> LibertyDillo fun story
[23:44:53] <Panther> Nope, routine cleaning, etc..
[23:45:00] <artao> i had a mole in my apt one winter
[23:45:09] <artao> Panther cool
[23:45:22] <artao> i only go when absolutely needed
[23:45:23] <Panther> Did you feed the mole mole sauce? :)
[23:45:28] <LibertyDillo> did you make it a pet?
[23:45:37] <artao> finding dentists that take medicare/medicaid is a BITCH
[23:45:56] <Panther> I found a cute Indian one in town.
[23:46:22] <artao> SO what happened was: I was in bed and half-awake when my cats started making a scufflin and meows that made me be like wtf is going on
[23:47:16] <artao> so i get up and they're VERY curious about this pile of clothes on the floor, so i poke at it ......... a narrow brown streak DARTS out of it and against a wall then into the other room and behind a bunch of stuff
[23:47:30] <LibertyDillo> hah
[23:47:33] <LibertyDillo> a bit of a surprise
[23:47:47] <artao> it kept going for the A/C, but everythyme I moved toward it it fled back. obviously
[23:48:05] <artao> so i created a "block" so it couldn't, which caused it to flee into my closet
[23:48:27] <artao> then i used obects from the closet to make another block, and kept removing bits
[23:48:28] <artao> well
[23:48:33] <artao> <sigh>
[23:49:01] <artao> i was a maintenance man, and part of the job was installing new kitchen cabinet/sink/cupboards
[23:49:21] <artao> so i have a BUNCH of sink cutouts from nice countertop material
[23:49:41] <artao> well ... they were stacked in the closet leaning up against the back wall.
[23:50:03] <artao> the mole had hidden under one of them, but as i unstacked them they shifted and the poor little thing got crushed
[23:50:05] <artao> :(
[23:50:09] <artao> made me very sad
[23:50:17] <artao> <sigh>
[23:51:01] <artao> at first, in the bedroom, i thought it was a mouse
[23:51:05] <artao> how it got inside? FUCK
[23:51:19] <artao> i dunno .... via the air conditioner it was trying to get back out of?
[23:52:00] <artao> poor little thing
[23:52:02] <LibertyDillo> awww, poor little mole
[23:52:16] <LibertyDillo> well, not your fault you were trying to save it
[23:52:20] <artao> mole: BrRRR i'm cold. But here's a warm draft. I can burrow thru there
[23:52:29] <artao> gets inside and investigates the area
[23:52:34] <artao> ........ cats notice ......
[23:52:38] <artao> mole: AAAHHHHHH
[23:52:43] <artao> human gets up
