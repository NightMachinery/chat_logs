[03:58:29] <michigan> i need fake users for my dating app prior to launch so people will think it's popular :D https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker does most of the job. but what if i could scrape tinder profile pics and have AI make changes to faces and their surruoundings so that it can no longer be considered stealing?

[18:30:44] <perro> really a saturated market
[18:31:57] <perro> fake profiles are lame
[18:44:14] *** Joins: huma (~huma@202.44.215.96)
[19:08:42] <michigan> That's one of my main selling-points though
[19:08:58] <michigan> I'll require government ID chips so it's literally impossible to make fake profiles on my app
[19:13:59] <nakilon> there are three better ways to do it: 1. detect fake profiles 2. don't build the economics around the app in such way that would attract scammer 3. target on smarter people who would also be not the scammers goal
[19:16:12] <michigan> Economics in what way? My app will be entirely free. No more expensive super-likes or boosts just to show your profile to others.
[19:17:03] <nakilon> good
[19:17:41] <nakilon> yes, profile boosting and microtransactions
[19:17:53] <michigan> It's frustrating using Tinder without money. Tinder will subtly reinforce the belief that you are a loser.
[19:18:05] <michigan> The minute you spend a couple of hundred however.
[19:18:22] <michigan> Boom, you can scroll for hours down your matches list :-)
[19:22:59] <nakilon> boost profiles of rubyists
[19:23:12] <nakilon> secretly
[19:25:04] <michigan> hehe
[19:28:14] <michigan> But no more algorithms! The stuff they've programmed Tinder to do is really mean.
[19:28:46] <nakilon> I heard it's some kind of ELO there
[19:30:14] <michigan> Grouping people into classes with some really nasty labels.
[19:30:57] <michigan> Never heard of that one.
[19:41:43] <michigan> I want to have fun.
[19:42:03] <michigan> I don't wanna have to stare into a cellphone all day and deal with all kinds of mindgames.
[19:42:34] <michigan> So I'm probably gonna change my app to be more like this: https://www.joe.ie/tech/tinder-fan-then-youll-love-this-tinder-style-app-for-house-parties-473349
[19:54:12] <nakilon> make such app for ruby github repos
[19:54:47] <nakilon> to search hot contributors in the area
[19:56:39] <adam12> LOL
