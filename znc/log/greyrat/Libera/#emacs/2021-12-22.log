[00:01:03] <raghavgururajan> So when I run `emacsclient -nw test.txt` in a terminal, I see "Waiting for Emacs ..." before a frame with buffer is fired up. Does that mean emacsclient is starting new emacs instead of connecting to the already running daemon?

[00:02:36] <Catie> Emacsclient grabs control of your shell session, and gives it back once the frame is closed. So it's the shell that's waiting
[00:02:37] <bpalmer> no, it's communicating with the daemon. You can verify this by putting text into a scratch buffer and seein gif it's there on the next emacsclient

[00:06:47] <acdw> lmao
[00:07:02] <raghavgururajan> Btw, how does emacsclient know that there is a daemon already running? Does `emacs --daemon` sets some kind of environment-variable with socket values?
[00:07:13] <acdw> raghavgururajan you can also see if the current frame is connected to emacs-server by looking at the (default) modeline
[00:07:31] <raghavgururajan> I see.

[01:31:34] <homerj> for every country
[01:31:55] <TRS-80> homerj: Yeah not doing that (any time soon, lol).
[01:32:18] <TRS-80> Here is what I have been kicking around so far (updated slightly from earlier): https://bpa.st/BMUA
[01:33:22] <homerj>  addresses are one of those things you just get "good enough" to do whatever it is you're going to do
[01:34:05] <TRS-80> These will be regular Orgmode property keys, of the form KEY_n_SUBKEY where n can be an integer, giving multiple instances of pretty much any KEY evcept those in the group at top
[01:34:06] <bpalmer> homerj: even that won't suffice. For example, lots of places in the Navajo Nation don't follow the Number, Street, City, State, Zipcode convention (which has caused problems with,e.g., voting)
[01:35:17] *** Quits: greenline (~user@user/greenline) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:35:32] <TRS-80> I mean Org property values are all strings, so it would be simple workaround just to put the whole line in ADDR_n_CITY field and be done with it.
[01:35:41] <bpalmer> homerj: so they're a part of the US but don't follow the typical convention. Apparently now they're using "plus codes" to identify some locations, which are derived from latitude and longitude
[01:35:46] <TRS-80> in such weird case
[01:36:12] <homerj> bpalmer: yeah, it's one of those things no matter what you do, it's going to fail somewhere
[01:36:58] <homerj> because you also get odd stuff, like if you have a Japanese address, something like Tokyo is a prefecture, and not a city
[01:37:30] <homerj> and I don't even think they are all that consistant within the country either

[01:41:33] <TRS-80> there is also, what's it called, general delivery (where you can pick it up in like a will call fashion)?  Learned about that watching RVing videos.

[03:24:56] <trevoke> ( https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el )
[03:25:00] <JordiGH> idk, I just download elisp and eval it.

[03:25:22] *** Quits: anton (anton@user/anton) (Quit: anton)
[03:25:34] <catern> what about straight off #emacs?
[03:25:35] <trevoke> Then you won't have this problem with my package as long as you don't mind opening nine or ten files and evaluating each buffer I guess
[03:26:01] <wgreenhouse> trevoke: this is not `straight` specific advice but the problem is likely load-path and/or autoloads

[03:26:44] <wgreenhouse> trevoke: the better way to test package installation would probably be with making a private package.el repo
[03:27:29] <trevoke> wgreenhouse: I'm sure it's something like that. I have autoload magic comments and they seem to work (after boot, the autoladed functions are available through M-x) but the rest of the package doesn't actually seem to get loaded (a macro, *also* autoloaded, errors out as not found when called through one of the autoloaded commands)
[03:27:30] <JordiGH> catern: I've done that too: https://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/file/tip/dotemacs.el#l94

[03:27:50] <gxt> xfce4-terminal haha :)
[03:27:59] <catern> I miss the lol-combos :(
[03:28:14] <trevoke> wgreenhouse: okay, that hadn't actually occurred to me, do you know what I should search for to set that up / how much work it is?

[03:32:14] <trevoke> zebrag: it's usually better than this, to be honest, as far as on-topic conversation
[03:32:18] <wgreenhouse> zebrag: the expectation is that if you ask an emacs question, people should make way for the emacs question
[03:32:38] <catern> zebrag: well, you *did* "ask to ask" rather than just asking your question
[03:32:38] <wgreenhouse> right now we have a couple of on-topic conversations happening
[03:33:01] <catern> (i.e. you asked "where should I ask about my issue" which is ill-advised, see https://dontasktoask.com/ )
[03:33:02] <Catie> Still though, none of us answered when zebrag asked
[03:33:09] <cvandusen> and it may be the case that no one has an answer to your question. 
[03:33:31] <catern> on the other hand, ,,asktoask
[03:33:32] <fsbot`> Please don't be rude! You can't just come in here and ask to ask. You must first ask to ask to ask!

[03:33:56] <fsbot`> Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help.
[03:33:57] <wgreenhouse> zebrag: w/r/t your actual question I'm not yet on emacs 28
[03:33:59] <JordiGH> Much more polite.

[03:34:46] <zebrag> wgreenhouse: they must make there way through everything else though. Really I'd wish it would be limited to on topic conversation like #debian channel is, any most of usual help channel are, it would be way easier (thanks about emacs 28)

[03:35:51] <JordiGH> Oh, Emacs 28, I'd have to compile it or something.
[03:36:20] <wgreenhouse> 28 is not yet "stable" emacs

[03:36:56] <catern> (which is Emacs 28, but a few months old)
[03:37:05] <zebrag> wgreenhouse: there is a #debian-next channel. Just as matter of fact and so very useful as the stable one
[03:37:17] <catern> zebrag: if you want to contribute, what would be really great is if you find an automatic reproducer, and use git bisect to find the commit which introduced the breaking behavior

[05:38:20] <trevoke> Okay, so I got the basic package-x thing to work, but I also think I don't need that because I can just call package-install-from-file after I create the tar file, and going through this path means I need to have packages for all the other dependencies available, which is a massive PITA, so ... uh... for the purposes of helping me with my package issue, can we assume that straight.el is a good package manager with which I can install
[05:38:20] <trevoke> org from source without a problem?
[05:41:58] <bpalmer> why do you need packages for all the other dependencies? Just so you can specify versions to depend on?

[05:43:19] <trevoke> bpalmer: I am not educated enough to give you a good answer beyond ... My package needs those packages to work well, so I have those marked as dependencies in the magic comments
[05:44:04] <bpalmer> trevoke: right, I just mean ,if they're not already packages (a) how did you get them installed to depend on in the first place? and (b) what would happen if you just left them off and assumed people who installed your package had them?
[05:45:13] <anticomputer> I prefer https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package + use-package over straight.el, I find the latter to be a bit overkill, and quelpa + quelpa-use-package strikes a nice middle ground when your goal is simply to install from source via melpa-style recipes
[05:45:35] <trevoke> bpalmer: okay, question 1 is about how I use emacs, I think, and the answer is use-package (or in this current situation, straight.el), and question two is about how other people use my package, and the answer to that is through melpa or melpa stable, or even package.el, where they can install my package and trust to get all the dependencies
[05:45:44] <bpalmer> trevoke: but answering the other part of it, I don't think people spit on the ground when straight is mentioned or anything.
[05:46:16] <trevoke> anticomputer okay, I need help preparing a multi-file package, do you think I should stop talking about straight and try quelpa in order to get help here? I'm down if that's what I need, I don't know how to find useful information to solve my problem anymore
[05:46:44] <anticomputer> trevoke: right, do all the files live in a single project or you're installing from multiple repos?

[05:47:33] <trevoke> anticomputer : it's my package, it's org-gtd.el, it's on github at trevoke/org-gtd.el, and all the elisp files are currently in the root directory, including a org-gtd-pkg.el file (if you go check it out, it's the 2.0.0 branch)
[05:47:52] <anticomputer> trevoke: cool, do you want to include all the files there in the package or just specific files?
[05:48:38] <trevoke> anticomputer all the .el files need to be there, but it also doesn't hurt to have others, as far as I know, to get it to install correctly
[05:49:27] <trevoke> anticomputer: I am willing to trust you to build the house AND remove the scaffolding at the same time if you're good enough for it, I am not and therefore have opted to try and just do one thing at a time (besides which I think I'll need to get a pull request out to melpa if I make further changes like put all the files in a lisp/ subdirectory
[05:50:28] <anticomputer> trevoke: so melpa recipes are pretty straightforward, you just give it a fetcher and specify which files from your project consitute "the package", hangon let me find you a canonical example
[05:50:40] <trevoke> anticomputer yep so the package is already on melpa

[10:35:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On debian cl-defgeneric is defined in EIEIO.
[10:35:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The two might simply have been merged/rewritten.

[15:49:21] <bpalmer> yep.
[15:49:48] <lechner> is there any way to render in emacs with CSS?
[15:49:57] <bpalmer> lechner: and, lastly, any significant function that you export should have a docstring describing what it does; (defun lintian-run-file (file) "Runs the lintian binary on the specified FILE." (interactive "fFile: ") ...)

[15:50:41] <bpalmer> lechner: if your package is lintian, then the functions should normally be named lintian-*   ; the lechner/whatever that I used the other day was to show that it was *not* a package function but a personal one

[15:51:09] <bpalmer> the slash is a newer convention, but packages just use a packagename-*
[15:51:58] <bpalmer> lastly, I'd probably instead of hardcoding "lintian", I'd make a package ("global") variable so that users can change it to be, e.g., a full path if they have it installed in /var/lintian/bin/  or some other unusual location.

[16:16:27] <theothornhill> That's the easiest, IMO
[16:16:38] <theothornhill> then just make and make install
[16:16:45] <ychaouche> ah, I think I'm going to get stuck with libc
[16:16:56] <ychaouche> I'll figure that out 
[16:17:43] <theothornhill> you might need some dependencies, but I installed it on a pretty vanilla linux the other day. didn't take much other than gcc
[16:17:46] <lampilelo> lechner: if you intend for the package to be used by others, you should use defcustom, and yes, people use it, emacs should be configurable entirely through customize, many people don't want to learn elisp
[16:18:00] <lechner> ok
[16:18:02] <bremner> ychaouche: yes.
[16:18:37] <lampilelo> lechner: you can eval anything by putting the point after the sexp and pressing C-x C-e
[16:18:43] <bremner> ychaouche: one tip for building on debian derivitives is "apt-get build-dep emacs"
[16:18:59] <ychaouche> interresting
[16:19:32] <ychaouche> but, wouldn't that get the depenendencies of the version provided by the distro instead of latest ?

[20:25:24] <codingquark> bkhl[m]: adding stuff as git submodules is pretty much the core idea. So you going all hardcore is actually the cleanest way of approaching it
[20:25:34] <anticomputer> +1 to org-roam in you're an adhoc note taker, I just dump TODO's left and right into roam nodes as I take notes throughout the day and then let org-agenda + org-todo-list make sense of it all when it comes time to tick things off.

[20:33:44] <anticomputer> between all the various approaches to custom emacs package management, I used git submodules for a long time, tried straight.el (which was nice, but kind of overkill for me), and settled on quelpa + a fork of melpa that contains recipes that point at forks of all the packages I use (i.e. all dependencies also come from my forks that way, and if it can't find a dep I simply fork one into place + vet/review the code)... can still track

[20:48:16] <siraben> bkhl: hm, what do you get if you run esup? curious as to why we have differences
[20:48:18] <bkhl[m]> OK.
[20:48:22] <siraben> maybe macOS process creation
[20:48:33] <anticomputer> siraben: so :fork (among other things) lets you say "use a fork of this package as opposed to the actual package when building", and you can specify an account name under which those forks generally live ... but afaict it will only do this for the primary recipe and still use the main package location for any dependencies it builds
[20:49:01] <siraben> here's the esup lisp form taking most of my init time https://github.com/siraben/dotfiles/blob/6423c24942ec626e2226f9cb45992029fbb2db63/emacs/.emacs.d/modules/siraben-packages.el#L28

[20:49:24] <anticomputer> siraben: so I want to be able to go "everything is a fork, and yolo out if it doesn't exist", but probably doing a custom recipe store is the better way to do that, which is similar to what i do with quelpa
[20:49:33] <siraben> so you need a recursive override, so to speak in Nix terms
[20:49:45] <anticomputer> right

[21:02:31] <raghavgururajan> The values for `set-foo-bar`stuff in init.lisp, should they be mentioned like "value" or 'value or value?
[21:02:42] <anticomputer> I think some of the direction for this kind of stuff is when you have behemoths like google who use that approach to train on their in-house code and turn the whole mechanism into super-tab-complete-for-our-context type thing

[21:03:24] <siraben> Is the license dilemma resolved yet? I recall that being a big barrier to adoption in some cases

[21:04:05] <anticomputer> siraben: yeah that's another area I'm very curious about myself, and also makes me feel like the license silo'd approach to training is where this stuff lands in actual prod use
[21:09:23] <anticomputer> raghavgururajan: in many cases it'll just be the symbol itself (i.e. 'value) but generally you'd just check describe-function or describe-variable to see what the docs say

[23:06:01] <xheimlich> raghavgururajan: noto schmoto. IBM Plex or get out of here.
[23:06:16] <acdw> i use uh, not that font
[23:06:44] <xheimlich> siraben: have you tried tabnine? it's sensible and modest. and quick on its feet.
[23:07:05] <xheimlich> I'm a proud WET practitioner. 
[23:07:27] <xheimlich> typing (as in keypunching) assistants are great for that.

[23:09:38] <xheimlich> anyway. I'm preparing a pen drive to leave at Baby Gilles's grandparents in case he gets fussy. Pen drives are great for that. 
[23:09:49] <xheimlich> Baby is quite specific about what he likes.
[23:09:51] <anticomputer> raghavgururajan: I set the default font through .Xresources (e.g. Emacs.font: DejaVu Sans Mono-13) on linux and set-frame-font on mac, but that's probably not ideal :) I don't worry about faces too much and leave that to the theme I use
[23:10:09] <Catie> I do the same thing
[23:10:26] <xheimlich> Thing is, I'd like to create an encrypted partition on that pen drive that the TV set doesn't see.

[23:19:54] <Catie> I don't know how you would make it so the TV doesn't _see_ the partition, but GELI-encrypting it would make it so the TV isn't able to access the contents
[23:20:58] <Catie> Or LUKS, if that's more your cup of tea
