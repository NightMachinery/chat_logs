[03:26:15] <Intelo> Hi
[03:26:16] <Intelo> I wonder where is lbry/odysee videos actually stored? I mean who hosts the blockchain? the browsers /viewers of the videos or are there special hosts? if latter is correct, I wonder how one single host can have all the video data?   b) if one host don't have all the data, then all should have the list/index/meta data of all videos in order for
[03:26:16] <Intelo> users to search "all" the videos

[10:17:39] <Everything> Hi all. I wonder one thing... RSA. I know many recommends to set e=65537. But I once saw a system where $e$ was large, as large as $pq$, but less than it. Coprime to (p-1)(q-1). Everything worked as usual. So I wonder, is this a problem or not? It's OK to pick large $e$? What consequences could be?
[10:20:09] <dude12312414> well, if e is large and was picked somewhat arbitrarily (or judiciously by some attacker) then d could end up being too small
[10:20:25] <dude12312414> there's also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_attack
[10:22:22] <Everything> dude12312414: thanks

[10:29:47] <Wulf> perhaps they set d = 65537
[10:30:19] <Everything> Wulf: no, $d$ was also large, but smaller than $e$
[10:30:40] <Everything> So basically, large $e$ is a sign of small $d$

[19:57:28] <Alipha> Everything: other than what dude already said, having a large e isn't necessarily a vulnerability. it's just extra work and makes encrypting slower.
[20:13:15] <caveman> is it possible to solve the double-spending problem in a delay tolerant manner? 
[20:13:55] <caveman> e.g. i pay person, and none of us are connected.  then in a month he may get connected to confirm.  but either way he sends me the goods while being confident that, even if i double-spent, he won't lose.
[20:14:08] <caveman> (or i lose more).
[20:14:38] *** Joins: WarpedAI (~Warped@user/warped)
[20:16:11] <ms7821> sure, you pay with a credit card provider, who then charges you at the end of the month
[20:16:52] <ms7821> or you use a purchase order for a business, on the understanding that he can pursue your business in court as a creditor if you don't pay when invoiced
[20:16:58] <caveman> but, then, the shop needs to be online and connect to the creditcard provider.  right?

[20:17:15] <ms7821> oh, you're talking about illegal purchases?
[20:17:29] <caveman> like drugs?
[20:18:36] <caveman> no.  not talking about illegal purchases.
[20:19:03] <caveman> just purchases in general.  regardless of legality.
[20:19:23] <ms7821> I don't think there's really a double-spending problem then
[20:20:24] <caveman> i think, every time money is given, there is a double spending problem.  different payments solve it differently.
[20:22:41] <caveman> i guess, credit card payment solves it by connecting to a trusty bank/creditcard company, with some kind of encrypted/signed connection.

[21:11:46] <maroon> seems like i remember a case a few years ago where welfare money was given on spendable debit cards, and there was a brief time where the retailer was always told that there was money in the account balance even when there wasnt. so word spread and people were buying like crazy
[21:11:47] <iz> no, credit cards work on credit.. there isn't a double-spending issue, that really only exists if you are trying to have a decentralized currency
[21:13:26] <maroon> it wasnt credit. it was a spendable debit card that gets loaded with their benefit once a month
[21:14:07] <iz> yeah, they do that w/ unemployment and other benefits in CA also -- put it on a special debit card
[21:14:23] <iz> must be some deal w/ the bank where it's cheaper for the state to manage or something
[21:15:54] <iz> i think if something like that happens, the bank issuing the card eats the cost
[21:23:21] <caveman> iz: the problem exists, and is solved by requiring connection to CC company to confirm payment.
[21:28:16] <maroon> related to Everything's question, i guess having a small-ish 'e' ensure that 'd' is large, because d can't be smaller than n/e
[21:29:36] <maroon> so, e is chosen to be fast with modular exponent, so in addition to being relatively small, 'e' should have fewer bits - so 65537 is much faster than 65521
