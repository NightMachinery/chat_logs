[16:40:28] <BtbN> With re-ordering and buffering that might not be a great metric though
[16:41:03] <roxlu> BtbN: yeah ok, so storing the timestamp in the frame as meta data?
[16:41:19] <BtbN> I guess you can do that as well
[16:41:25] <BtbN> But do you really care that much about that info?
[16:41:33] <BtbN> The general throughput is much more interesting
[16:42:26] <roxlu> Oh did you mean just measuring the time between `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags()` and `av_buffersink_get_frame()`? I would assume that the filter doesn't directly return the latest frame I passed into it. Or does it?
[16:42:41] <roxlu> BtbN: I'm trying to figure out the bottleneck in my current implementation
[16:43:28] <BtbN> Well, all you're gonna find out is how long the whole chain took
[16:43:43] <BtbN> Which could be, for a single frame, several seconds, while the chain is doing 100+ fps, depending on how deep the buffers are
[16:43:53] <BtbN> (In a rather extreme case)
[16:44:33] <roxlu> yeah I agree, but at least it would give some info; currently we don't know anything about the filter graph

[16:51:25] <acagastya> Hi, I am trying to retrive the duration in seconds, artist and title of audio files.  While `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 FILE` worked, replacing `format=duration` with `format=artist` but that yields nothing.  How can I extract that information?
[16:54:40] <c_14> might be stream metadata, check the output of ffprobe -show_format -show_streams to find out what the fields you're interested in are called and where they're located
[16:58:05] <acagastya> c_14 I ran `ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams FILE` and looks like I need to extract `TAG:ARTIST` and `TAG:TITLE`.
[16:58:47] <acagastya> `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=TAG:ARTIST -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 FILE` does not seem to work.
[17:06:42] <c_14> -show_entries stream_tags=artist
[17:07:39] <c_14> the TAG: means it's in _tags and it should be stream metadata not format
[17:08:52] <c_14> using -of flat or -of json can make the output more intuitive
[17:09:07] <c_14> or at least more verbose
[17:12:58] <roxlu> BtbN: it seems ffmpeg isn't happy with what I'm doing :^) https://gist.github.com/roxlu/30c8a16c2507713f73744c780bc86fe2
[17:14:53] <acagastya> c_14, I ran `ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream_tags=title -of flat 08\ Bubble\ Gum.flac` and I got nothing.  I ran `ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams  08\ Bubble\ Gum.flac` and I get https://0x0.st/-Ry0.txt -- I don't understand where I got wrong.
[17:15:46] <c_14> ah, in your case they are format metadata, do format_tags=title instead
[17:16:59] <acagastya> That works, c_14!  Thanks!
