[01:17:43] <Mateon1> I finally worked around yt-dlp breaking because of a specific googlevideo server being inaccessible for me
[01:18:20] <Mateon1> Patched the _real_extract function in youtube.py to rewrite the URL to the fallback if it detects the (hardcoded) broken server

[02:30:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Does an issue exist about live_chat downloading not having retry logic?
[02:31:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I looked for an email address or list to submit a bug report but none seems to exist.
[03:20:01] <tar_xvf> Aurora_v_kosmose: am pretty sure yt-dlp is hosted on a github page, did you try making an issue there?
[03:20:17] <tar_xvf> https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
[03:29:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm surprised to find that github doesn't do the "d0x yourself with phone lol" bullshit.
[03:43:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, I hadn't done so already purely because I worried about that. Turns out it's not a problem.
[04:46:42] <tar_xvf> I feel like this is a stupid easy question but what is a storyboard when downloading a youtube video?
[04:49:16] <tar_xvf> i just read #2048 about downloading storyboards as jpegs
[05:18:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't include any example links?
[07:08:25] <pabs3> Mateon1: the fallback thing sounds worth adding to yt-dlp, since other folks could be affected by it too, you might want to submit a PR about that

[15:53:55] <ede> tar_xvf: afaik they are the papers with the scenery sketches you prepare before starting the shooting. in youtube this may be the series of preview images used when you hover a video's timeline.
