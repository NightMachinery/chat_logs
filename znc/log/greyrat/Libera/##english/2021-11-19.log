[01:16:26] <bbbbb> hello!
[01:17:31] <bbbbb> blkshp Here's a question you might know....am I right that if a word has a Latin etymology, the plural ends in 'i'
[01:17:45] <bbbbb> but in greek it ends in 's'

[01:18:09] <bbbbb> and if so, what if it was used in both Greek and Latin?
[01:19:35] <LjL> no that's not right
[01:19:57] <LjL> i'm not sure if you mean "in their respective languages" or "in English", but it's not correct in either case
[01:19:57] <twb> bbbbb: trivial counterexample: "genera"
[01:20:09] <LjL> right, many latin words in -um get -a in English, or -ums
[01:20:17] <twb> one genus, many genera
[01:20:23] <LjL> and also greek: phenomenon, phenomena
[01:21:11] <bbbbb> Interesting
[01:21:36] <bbbbb> so there's no set rule for which it might be?
[01:21:41] <LjL> not really
[01:22:19] <LjL> besides, the vast majority of English words (though not *the most common* ones) have a Latin or a Greek etymology (often through Latin and then some variety of French)
[01:22:53] <LjL> so there are the "obvious" Latin and Greek words, such as the ones in -us, -um, -on and so on, but really a ton of other words *also* have a Latin etymology, and the vast majority just gets a plural in -s
[01:23:27] <LjL> thw words "majority" and "common" have a Latin etymology, and "etymology" has a Greek etymology
[01:30:03] <Jong> Is it correct english to say that I "got" something to work?
[01:30:17] <Jong> "I got it working."
[01:30:24] <twb> Jong: sounds OK to me
[01:30:45] <Jong> Are there better words ?
[01:31:42] <bbbbb> Common coming from the latin communis...con meaning bringing together, munus meaning duty, obligation. Is this where the word communism comes from?
[01:31:47] <LjL> "I got it working" is colloqually very valid, but if you want something that sounds "better" (under some definition) in writing, then i dunno, "I made it work" or even "I succeeded in making it work". it can quickly get ridiculous.

[01:36:01] <LjL> the only deciding body is the speakers who use the word
[01:36:21] <LjL> if there is no general agreement among them, then there is no general agreement among them, and both can be "correct"
[01:36:41] <LjL> Wiktionary says "cactus (plural cacti or cactuses or cactusses or cactus)" so personally i wouldn't have an issue with using either

[03:10:21] <Voxel> What do you think? Is that grammatically correct?: "Left immediately after their message was removed."
[03:10:41] <Voxel> It's the reason why they left. I suspect a time issue.

[03:19:09] <LjL> That's grammatically correct, with either because or after. "After" doesn't imply it's the reason but depending on the context it might be easily guessed as such
[03:19:59] <Voxel> For some reason it sounds like their message was removed later when they left.

[03:22:39] <LjL> Uh no
[03:23:01] <LjL> To get that meaning you'd have to say "afterwards", not "after"
[03:23:44] <LjL> With "after" the ambiguity could be whether they left "immediately after" or they left immediately *and* it was after the message was removed
[03:24:02] <LjL> But in both cases, 1) first the message is removed 2) then they leave

[06:03:09] <iroha> Trying to think of a phrase - If you're unaffected by someone's actions because their choice only affects themself, but they do something like make an excuse/apologize anyway that seems to imply otherwise. If you do a favor for someone to help them meet a deadline, and then they say "I gotta do such and such, but I'll start on the task again tomorrow", but it doesn't affect you when they do the
[06:03:11] <iroha> task cause it's not your deadline, you might say the phrase. I have some vague idea it's like "No ... on my part"

[06:05:32] <Me-me> I've heard skin off nose. But you can adapt it to all sorts of metaphors, really, depending on aesthetic. No eggs out of my basket. No icing off my muffin.
[06:06:15] <iroha> Think I was specifically going for "no skin off my back", but no skin off my teeth made me remember it immediately
[06:06:42] <iroha> but yeah I've heard "by the skin of my teeth"

[06:07:56] <iroha> yeah. Would no skin off my teeth be a malaphor? Kinda works in the sense that you can just stick whatever into the idiom (muffin example), but it's definitely a combination
[06:08:04] <[itchyjunk]> hi, what do you call it when someone says "I would say stuff like that around here" to suggest to the person they shouldn't
[06:08:24] <[itchyjunk]> cause someone is taking it literally and i didn't intend it like that -,-
[06:09:03] <twb> [itchyjunk]: "wrong"
[06:09:05] <Me-me> Well, for one thing, I think you meant "wouldn't". And you could call it a warning or a threat, depending on context.
[06:09:19] <[itchyjunk]> i wouldn't*
[06:09:20] <iroha> It is literal? "I wouldn't say that around here(in this environment)"
[06:09:25] <[itchyjunk]> Me-me, yes
[06:09:40] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think it's a threat
[06:09:43] <Me-me> iroha: "Sure, but why would I care what you would do? I'm not you."
[06:10:45] <[itchyjunk]> hmm maybe it is some sort of warning or suggestion or somesuch
[06:10:55] <[itchyjunk]> thought there would be a name for the concept, maybe not
[06:11:12] <[itchyjunk]> like "If I were you, i wouldn't say that"
[06:11:28] <Me-me> If there's a formal term for it, I don't know it.
[06:11:37] <MetaNova> a warning
[06:11:45] <Me-me> That's what I said!
[06:12:23] <Me-me> But I think he's referring to the implied hypothetical and secondary first person perspective parts of it, as opposed to the intention of directive.
[06:13:42] <[itchyjunk]> yes, that
[06:16:12] <iroha> implied subjunctive? "If I were you, I wouldn't..."
[06:16:51] <iroha> or "I would", or any suggestion really

[07:14:31] <heck> helloes, i almost speak english
[07:16:06] <Loshki> "If I were you" is a classic subjunctive. It is disappearing from English, as plenty of speakers also (incorrectly) say and accept "If I was you" in it's place.
[07:16:51] <heck> I occasionally quote Shakespeare, but that's only rarely. So you should worry not. Currently reading one of the works of "Lee Child"
