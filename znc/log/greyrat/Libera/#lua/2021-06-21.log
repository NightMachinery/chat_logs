[01:34:30] <technomancy> is it normal that when I press tab in a lua 5.4 readline-enabled repl that I get completion based on the contents of the current directory rather than the globals?
[01:38:15] <Elw3> Yep
[01:38:33] <Elw3> Here too, not 5.4 tho.
[01:38:45] <technomancy> is it just me or is that kinda hilarious?
[01:38:56] <Elw3> Its odd.
[01:39:33] <Elw3> I dont get where lua get this files from. 
[01:39:59] <technomancy> it's like it's just inheriting the completion source from the shell it was launched from or something
[01:40:11] <technomancy> (but I don't think that's what's actually happening because that would be bizarre)
[01:40:59] <Elw3> So the terminal interptets it as "lua tab" instead a running program?
[01:40:59] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d4c90a.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[01:41:34] <technomancy> no, the terminal has no idea what completion even is
[01:41:53] <technomancy> more like readline is set up in a way that would make sense for a shell, but lua is not a shell
[01:54:31] <technomancy> I guess I should probably report it to the mailing list?
[01:54:56] <Elw3> It does the same on 5.2
[01:55:24] <technomancy> huh for some reason I thought the readline support was new in 5.4
[01:55:28] <Elw3> If it doesnt crash anything, its a feature, not a bug.
[02:00:39] <Elw3> And what are you working on these days technomancy ?

[02:25:22] <technomancy> Elw3: hbu
[02:26:09] <Elw3> holly shit, youre making a gameboy emu
[02:26:26] <technomancy> no, not making; just using
[02:26:43] <technomancy> my game is stupid simple. it's a port of a TIC-80 game I made a while back, but worse, because it's in C
[02:28:15] <Elw3> ohhh
[02:28:46] <Elw3> Still making my löve based code editor thing.
[02:29:12] <technomancy> cool cool
[02:29:17] <Elw3> Just made a color picker for it. And it has syntax highlighting now
[02:29:36] <Elw3> That one https://ul.larskl.de/3bbc/Bla.mkv
[02:30:27] <Elw3> The syntax highlighter is great, it beats everything i found in the löve forum. But, i hesitate to publish it.
[02:30:28] <technomancy> that's pretty slick!
[02:30:42] <technomancy> bold choice to use proportional fonts
[02:31:08] <technomancy> are you using it to edit itself?
[02:31:18] <Elw3> Propotonial?
[02:31:29] <technomancy> non-monospaced
[02:32:07] <Elw3> Yes, by now i can start using it regulary for myself, the color picker saves a lot of time while writing themes.
[02:32:26] <Elw3> also its self loading changed themes so i get live result.
[02:33:40] <technomancy> using your own editor to edit itself is the best feeling
[02:33:49] <technomancy> especially with hot reloads
[02:35:50] <Elw3> It is a milestone really, my speed for doing stuff is going up.
[02:36:57] <Elw3> I am stuck on liquid runner... how far have you made it?
[02:37:44] <Elw3> inb4: no second level.
[03:12:10] <technomancy> Elw3: liquid runner 3 is super unfinished; try liquid runner II

[03:18:32] <technomancy> yeah the soundtrack was added at the last minute by my collaborator; he rewrote all the instruments that I had been using for sfx and the game jam ended before I realized what happened.

[03:21:01] <Elw3> Eh, just span the deadline a tad more, very few care if you buffix after ending.
[03:22:17] <technomancy> the problem is he wrote the soundtrack and I don't want to screw up his work but I don't really know anything about sound
[03:23:31] <Elw3> I dont think thats the problem. Its using 100% cpu straight, its more like i have sound frameskips.
[03:23:40] <technomancy> hm
[03:23:43] <technomancy> I should add a mute key
[03:23:59] <technomancy> but it runs smoothly on my core 2 duo thinkpad from 2008
[03:24:15] <technomancy> oh, but that's the native tic-80; I don't know whether the web version runs on that machine
[03:27:03] <Elw3> Hah lol, yea it is the cpu, if i switch the tab so no rendering happens i can actually hear music.
[03:28:09] <Elw3> Congrats on #1 rank entertainment tho.

[04:35:47] <Elw3> I made it to the second woman encounter, thats enough for my taste.
[04:36:36] <technomancy> yeah it's pretty long for a game jam game
[04:36:43] <Elw3> Kek on the bug that lets you split water poodles, i am moses now.
[04:37:36] <Elw3> Interesting that a löve entry won the lisp game jam...
[04:37:57] <technomancy> it's not unusual
[04:38:13] <Elw3> yea, cause löve is awesome :D
[04:38:44] <technomancy> I think it's been either a love2d game or a tic-80 game winning the lisp game jam since at least 2018
[04:38:59] <Elw3> 18 entries, i thought the jam i participated in was small.
[04:40:52] <technomancy> the gba jam I'm in just hit 500 people
[04:41:03] <technomancy> but man... gba dev is interesting but just not as fun
[04:41:30] <Elw3> Yea... if you cant do lua...
[04:41:49] <technomancy> it is theoretically possible to run lua on the device but the only thing I could find about it was using lua 4.0
[04:42:32] <Elw3> The limits are probably too harsh to make any use out of it.
[04:43:02] <technomancy> yeah it's like ... you could load up the VM but then you wouldn't have any ram left for your game
[04:43:34] <Elw3> What one need is to define the game in lua and then compile it to gba
[04:43:52] <technomancy> I was going to try nelua
[04:43:57] <technomancy> but like
[04:44:04] <technomancy> it's just more fun to do tic80
[04:44:25] <Elw3> wait there is fun in coding?
[04:44:58] <technomancy> running on hardware from 2001 is cool for novelty but it wears off after your seventeenth bug caused by not having access to real data structures in your clownshoes programming language
[04:46:06] <Elw3> Maybe ill try it sometimes, sounds like you need a lot of clever hacks for awesome results, happens that is all i can.
[04:47:16] <Elw3> I actually thought about an emulator, but one that rips the graphic out and replaces it so you can play kirbys dream land in HD.
[04:48:28] <Elw3> A guy i talked with did that for NES, it looked super weird.
[04:50:51] <technomancy> the tom7 thing?
[04:51:02] <technomancy> he's a legend
[04:53:13] <Elw3> I dont think so. But who knows. As i underst[05:24:17] *** Quits: Elw3 (~Elw3@dynamic-046-114-167-116.46.114.pool.telefonica.de) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
