[00:03:27] <Church> Welp get my buyout cash on... thursday I think
[00:03:28] <Church> Cool
[00:03:36] <Church> Less cool I lose like a third easy
[00:03:53] <Church> Least I don't have to figure out the taxes on my own
[00:13:06] <ngoldbaum> buyout? like severance?
[00:13:25] <ngoldbaum> or they’re buying options from you or something?
[00:17:54] <Church> ngoldbaum: Company got acquired and I got a buyout for all my options
[00:18:04] <Church> Was the large sum of money I mentioned last week
[00:18:29] <ngoldbaum> niiiice
[00:18:42] <ngoldbaum> the options were actually worth something
[00:18:44] <ngoldbaum> hooray
[00:18:48] <Church> Yeah heh
[00:18:55] <Church> Getting like $65k~ after taxes
[00:19:00] <ngoldbaum> nice!
[00:19:02] <Church> So there's a house down payment
[00:19:07] <ngoldbaum> down payment on a house money yeah
[00:19:14] <ngoldbaum> or a condo
[00:19:19] <Church> Assuming I can stay at or under $350k
[00:19:20] <ngoldbaum> depending on where you are
[00:19:23] <Church> Yeah definitely a house
[00:19:25] <Church> Might move upstate
[00:19:30] <Church> I don't want neighbors anymore
[00:19:34] <Church> Fuck that noise
[00:19:39] <Church> I'm going full on hermit
[00:19:43] <ben> i just bought a house!
[00:19:47] <ngoldbaum> yeah you’re not getting a $350k house in long island, well one you’d want to live in
[00:19:53] <Church> Eyep
[00:20:19] <ngoldbaum> congrats ben
[00:20:22] <Church> And I wanna stay somewhere not in danger of rising water heh
[00:20:30] <Church> So looking at some counties a bit north of westchester
[00:20:34] <ngoldbaum> i just found a house that is nice and wheelchair accessible for my fiance, we move in august
[00:20:35] <Church> county.*
[00:20:39] <Church> Nice!
[00:20:41] <edm> about 50% of robert downey jr’s screen ouvre seems to involve him putting on slightly showy sunglasses
[00:21:07] <ben> didn't have to move cause we bought the house we were renting
[00:21:52] <Church> Ah nice!
[00:30:23] <hoistbypetard> ben: congrats! moving sucks. that's awesome that you skipped it.
[00:30:46] <riv> cool ben  :)
[00:30:57] <ben> feeling very adult lately lol
[00:31:05] <edm> ben: i did exactly the same. a real saviour of faff
[00:31:07] <edm> however
[00:31:15] <edm> do tackle those boxes full of ‘misc.’
[00:31:17] <ben> felt somewhat anti-climactic
[00:31:22] <edm> else they sit for another decade
[00:31:27] <ben> i've been living here since 2017
[00:31:45] <edm> for another 0.5decade
[00:31:55] <hoistbypetard> you should definitely treat the clutter as if you were moving :)
[00:32:39] <edm> it feels cathartic. i still find the odd little pile accrued
[00:32:40] <ben> true
[00:32:52] <ben> really need to go through and reorganize the basement
[00:32:52] <edm> i need a shredder here really
[00:34:39] <hoistbypetard> edm: our local municipality offers a shredding event once a month where they let you carry a big pile of things to the giant industrial shredder they operate on behalf of the school system. it is both more satisfying and more space efficient to watch your stuff go into that behemoth
[00:35:24] <edm> that’s an absolutely great idea!
[00:35:29] <edm> i would love that here
[00:44:50] <Church> Yeah I'm looking at Rockland county in NY possibly
[00:54:12] <Church> Far as housing goes
[01:08:34] <ngoldbaum> i wonder if nintendo originally planned to have better internals in the new switch but got fucked by semiconductor shortages so they redid the internals to match the OG switch which they can source parts for

[21:35:55] <buttsbot> OpenDoas: Insufficient environment filtering (GLSA 202107-11) — Gentoo security
[21:35:59] <kline> its all over for doas now
[21:36:14] <kline> despite years of "sudo a shit doas is far superior", theyve done exactly the same thing
[21:39:19] <prussian> Church: not quite PC LOAD LETTER, but a thermal printer replacement project is about as equally nightmarish. earlier revs had bugs where the printer would just constantly feed paper.
[21:39:22] <prussian> does that count?
[21:39:55] <prussian> of course zero ability to actually inspect firmware source, so a lot of back and forth happened.
[21:40:41] <indigo> kline: I tried arguing with ddv that counting vuln count for doas vs. sudo was disingenuous
[21:48:09] <cb> kline: i've gotten jaded about OpenBSD stuff. they tout omg security security yet do little other than plug holes in the boat and go for minimalism as aesthetic
[21:48:16] <cb> where's the formal methods? memory safety?
[21:48:57] <cb> kline: wasnt sudo developed by an openbsd developer anyways?
[21:49:01] <cb> saturn eating his own
[21:49:43] <kline> cb, im pretty much sat in the "its all shit" camp
[21:49:56] <kline> the idea that linux is more secure than mac is more secure than windows is garbage
[21:50:18] <kline> you get vulnerabilities discovered in proportion to your value as a target, which is often based on your user count
[21:50:54] <kline> every bit of software is buggy - if you appear to be disproportionately non-buggy, it just means people havent discovered or diclosed your bugs
[21:51:13] <kline> this is almost more worrying than having a steady stream of bugfixes
[21:51:20] <ngoldbaum> i think the assumption that the vast majority of C codebases are giant balls of CVEs bears out in practice
[21:52:31] <Church> I'd agree.
[21:52:39] <Church> Can still write shite rust/ada
[21:52:40] <cb> i think security has to be both in design and tooling. even a disciplined programmer will write bugs in C that are made possible by the language semantics. the corollary is someone inexperienced in rust could create other kinds of vulns (i.e dos or logic) in a memory safe application
[21:52:40] <buttsbot> >unsafe {} sex can be dangerous
[21:52:45] <Church> Just a bit harder then C
[21:53:02] <Church> cb: Agreed 100%
[21:53:33] <indigo> kline: to be fair to OpenBSD, they do a lot of work on memory protection and process privilege separation
[21:53:58] <indigo> It’s not all just “lower attack surface due to less features”
[21:54:00] <cb> i'm going back in time to kill rob pike
[21:54:06] <cb> anyone care to join me
[21:54:43] <indigo> Safety not guaranteed?
[21:54:52] <drakonis> indigo: they're not enough of a target though
[21:54:56] <cb> if it means we won't get go, i'll be happy
[21:55:13] <cb> openbsd's memory prot stuff just seems like more guard pages rather than anything fundamental
[21:55:19] <drakonis> the bigger the target painted on your back, the more people will come after you
[21:55:46] <cb> if you have a guarded castle, it'll be harder than a house, even if you have more people looking for you
[21:56:04] <ngoldbaum> pledge is interesting
[21:56:18] <drakonis> linux has stolen pledge
[21:56:21] <drakonis> its landlock now
[21:56:34] <indigo> What is more fundamental stuff? Formal verification?
[21:56:51] <kline> indigo, yes, its true, but i suspect the ground the make up in that work they lose by not having the same size userbase finding and fixing stuff
[21:57:31] <ngoldbaum> indigo: using a language where integer overflow doesn’t lead to undefined behavior are arbitrary code execution
[21:57:40] <ngoldbaum> s/are/and/
[22:07:23] <indigo> ngoldbaum: But muh ddv!
[22:08:30] <prussian> linux has pledge? huh?
[22:08:30] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.

[22:11:24] <indigo> In other fun news, my wife's car had its catalytic converter stolen again
[22:11:49] <indigo> So much for parking in a garage being a deterrent
[22:12:05] <cb> put a carb in
[22:12:55] <ngoldbaum> indigo: prius?
[22:13:13] <ngoldbaum> apparently one thing you can do is have a shop engrave the vin in the catalytic converter
[22:13:36] <indigo> You know it!
[22:13:36] <ngoldbaum> i think also you can have a custom plate cover it to make it harder to get out with an angle grinder
[22:13:55] <indigo> We'll be trying the plate solution after it gets replaced again
[22:14:10] <indigo> However I heard that the plates/cages don't stop determined cat thieves
[22:14:18] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s true
[22:14:20] <indigo> I think the ultimate solution is to get a new car
[22:14:26] <indigo> Something not-Prius
[22:14:35] <indigo> Sucks about the current car market though
[22:14:35] <ngoldbaum> old priuses are bad for this yup
[22:15:03] <prussian> people still steal cats?
[22:15:06] <prussian> where the fuck.
[22:15:12] <indigo> Oh yeah man
[22:15:21] <indigo> They've only gotten more valuable from what I've heard
[22:15:21] <ngoldbaum> old priuses have more platinum in them than other cats i think?
[22:15:26] <prussian> is the economy and the general populous this fucked?
[22:15:41] <ngoldbaum> 2020 was hard for a lot of people
[22:15:46] <indigo> Yep :) Covid has only widened the gap between rich and poor
[22:15:48] <prussian> I mean ya, lot of money.

[22:30:07] <Church> Both because of low new stock, general poverty, or for parts
[22:30:29] <Church> And then you can add in general thievery due to the widening economic gap
[22:34:08] <prussian> it's humorous. I bought a new car in 2018 and it just sits there most the time. shame.

[23:14:29] <prussian> https://venthur.de/2021-06-26-python-packaging.html <-- this speaks to my soul... I almost wish my team chose "Go" as the second language over python.
[23:14:29] <buttsbot> The State of Python Packaging in 2021 | Bastian Venthur's Blog
[23:19:02] <ngoldbaum> i disagree about wheels solving the binary deps problem
[23:19:15] <prussian> nothing solves the binary dep problem lol
[23:19:15] * ngoldbaum looks at insane multi-gigabyte tensorflow wheels
[23:19:45] <ngoldbaum> also if you try to do anything thst involves a reasonably complicated set of non-python dependencies it gets hairy fast
[23:20:10] <prussian> I am trying to figure out the best pipeline from taking bin dep python stuff and throw it on an arm device
[23:20:14] <ngoldbaum> sure you can statically include whatever you want in the wheel but do you necessarily want that for really complicated things?
[23:20:35] <prussian> I-i don't know.
[23:20:43] <prussian> I still don't know what a wheel is
[23:20:43] <prussian> lol
[23:21:00] <ngoldbaum> the main reason data science people like anaconda is the non-python stuff they care about is packaged
[23:21:23] <prussian> I fucked around with nix and it actually seems like it solves my problem, but I have this feeling that no one wants to use nix at work
[23:21:30] <ngoldbaum> because pip/pypa don’t package it (much, there’s a qt5 wheel iirc), you need to do ad-hoc things to include them
[23:21:45] <prussian> damn...
[23:21:50] <prussian> sounds, uh special
[23:21:57] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s bad
[23:22:02] <ngoldbaum> also cultural bad feels all around
[23:22:12] <ngoldbaum> the conda people don’t talk to the pip people
[23:22:19] <ngoldbaum> and when they do trolls yell at them about it
[23:22:29] <prussian> thankfully my use is just shoving aws crap into a armv7l device.
[23:22:44] <cb> conda seems like it's HPC people galapagos
[23:22:52] <cb> from my extremely distant view
[23:22:58] <prussian> well apparently pipenv or whatever is detached from cpython core too...
[23:23:02] <ngoldbaum> not hpc as much as scientific python writ large
[23:23:07] <ngoldbaum> lots of that stuff outside of hpc
[23:23:11] <prussian> and last I used it, it literally defaults to the wrong interpreter
[23:23:14] <ngoldbaum> hpc uses spack
[23:23:39] <prussian> gee... I invoked you as python3 -m pipenv which is not the same as /usr/bin/python3... so wtf?
[23:23:39] <cb> man i feel a little lucky i'm the furthest from scientigic computing you can get
[23:23:41] <ngoldbaum> (another source-only package manager, because you want to use the intel compilers on a supercomputer or whatever)
[23:24:03] <prussian> w-why
[23:24:18] <prussian> this sounds worse than what I'm bitching about
[23:24:26] <ngoldbaum> you want your application to eek out that last 20% of performance by natively tuning to the hardware
[23:24:42] <ngoldbaum> if you’re running on 10^5 cores…
[23:24:48] <ngoldbaum> gets expensive fast
[23:25:00] <cb> yeah see i work with midwesteners writing PHP and RPG
[23:25:07] <cb> this is a very distant world from where i am
[23:25:27] <prussian> ya but... is ICC really that much better? code genning for x86 has to be hell for everyone
[23:25:36] <ngoldbaum> for new intel cpus yeah
[23:25:43] <prussian> weird. ok.
[23:25:53] <prussian> wouldn't know I guess
[23:26:20] <ngoldbaum> avx-512 support or whatever
[23:27:05] <ngoldbaum> a lot of binaries available via package managers are compiled to a very old abi
[23:27:47] <ngoldbaum> you can get a lot more performance by compiling for a newer architecture or march=native, at least compared with binaries from pip or whatever that were compiled on centos6
[23:28:23] <prussian> so ICC just has cooler simd intrinsics then?
[23:28:30] <prussian> for their avx512?
[23:29:41] <ngoldbaum> for whatever bells and whistles the cpu supports, intel can support it faster than gcc can
[23:29:56] <ngoldbaum> also a lot of hpc stuff needs cuda these days
[23:30:09] <ngoldbaum> shipping cuda code as a binary also a whole other can of worms
[23:30:44] <prussian> damn, rip.
[23:39:03] <prussian> welp, nix just works. I legitimately want to force nix on everyone at work now
[23:39:15] <prussian> it's ridiculous how many problems it solves for my use.
[23:41:07] <riv> tell me more! I like nix
[23:41:45] <prussian> idk lol. I just want a way to declare dependencies that are not linked to any particular platform and are the same for x86 and arm.
[23:42:21] <prussian> right now I have: Timesys Factory for armv7l-timesys-linux-gnueabi, and whatever Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04 ships for x86.
[23:42:57] <Geekingfrog> I have some conflicting experiences with nix. At a previous workplace we used nix shell to distribute some tools, and that was working reasonably well. I tried to build something using nix, and it failed miserably. And I have a good friend who describes his experience with nixOS (for 2 years) as "being taken hostage by his laptop"
[23:42:59] <prussian> it's a cluster. the few nix derivations I made so far seem to just work for both cases. hell I just got python running on this device using: https://images.ghetty.space/paste/RKgN4
[23:43:20] <prussian> boom. AWS cloud spyware, no multi interpreter insanity whatever crap
[23:43:34] <prussian> cross compiles just fine...
[23:43:36] <prussian> ez.
[23:43:52] <prussian> I had started partial work on x86 for the core software, but I'm the only one using it
[23:44:20] <prussian> note I have NO CLUE what I'm doing either and it already seems easier to me
[23:45:32] <prussian> Geekingfrog: IDK. anything has to be better than spending a massive effort up front of declaring and building all dependencies in like cmake.
[23:45:49] <prussian> but I'd rather try and waste more time with the wonky crap going on now.
[23:45:57] <prussian> than waste*
[23:46:48] <prussian> Hell, maybe I can remove timesys from the equation entirely with nixos
