[01:22:03] <TechTest> most people on freenode/libera are older

[07:56:18] <toretto> Which one if these is correct?
[07:56:27] <toretto> s/if/of/
[07:56:27] <chat> toretto meant to say: Which one of these is correct?
[07:58:36] <twb> (a) or (c)
[07:59:06] <toretto> thx
[08:01:21] <toretto> twb: Could you tell me why?
[08:04:23] <twb> I can't really think how to explain it
[08:05:13] <twb> I feel like a vs c is maybe about like... if the foods are already categorized/grouped?
[08:05:27] <twb> but I'm not very confident
[08:05:52] <LuisP18> making reference to a multiple
[08:06:24] <mdogg> I think (a), (b), and (c) can work depending on how it's phrased.  toretto:  Can you give an example of how you intend to use it in a sentence?
[08:07:27] <LuisP18> .. and (d) ...
[08:10:06] <toretto> mdogg: "That state of impurity is caused by certain conduct such as eating certain kinds of foods like apples."
[08:10:33] <toretto> s/apples/apple/
[08:10:33] <chat> toretto meant to say: mdogg: "That state of impurity is caused by certain conduct such as eating certain kinds of foods like apple."
[08:11:35] <twb> toretto: haha are you doing ayurveda shit
[08:12:18] <toretto> twb: nah, I was just trying to come-up with some example.
[08:12:18] <twb> toretto: I would avoid two "conduct" there
[08:12:27] <toretto> idk what is ayurveda
[08:12:32] <mdogg> For example, "I go to Alpha Beta for a certain kind of food."  or "Sometimes I want a verity, so I'll go to Alpha Beta because they have a variety of certain kinds of foodinds that a pescatarian might enjoy."   or  You know what - Only A and B
[08:12:39] <twb> ayurveda is south asian folk medicine
[08:12:54] <twb> "That state of impurity is caused by certain conduct, such as eating apples"
[08:13:28] <twb> "Eating some foods can cause a state of impurity"
[08:13:31] <toretto> But I should include the word "food" because "food" is superset and "apple" is a subset.
[08:13:46] <mdogg> Ok, i guess twb's example could work.
[08:13:55] <toretto> Yeah, I guess that works.
[08:13:56] <twb> toretto: it's an ugly sentence because you have an example "inside" an example
[08:14:13] <twb> "That state of impurity is caused by certain conduct (such as eating certain kinds of foods (such as apples))."
[08:14:42] <toretto> hmm, that looks weired TBH, twb 
[08:14:56] <twb> the brackets are just to show what I mean by "inside"
[08:15:00] <toretto> I've never seen (()) like bracket inside another one.
[08:15:22] <toretto> I've never came across one of those.
[08:15:32] <toretto> But yeah, interesting.
[08:15:43] <mdogg> It depends on how you word it.  "Certain foods are high in sugar and can cause tooth decay."  vs "Some food is high in sugar and can cause tooth decay."
[08:16:52] <mdogg> You woudln't say, "Certain foods is..."  or "Some food are..."
[08:19:17] <LuisP18> all this food has me hungry
[08:20:10] <toretto> LuisP18: has me hungry or made me hungry?
[08:21:06] <LuisP18> well, i'm already hungry, so :P
[08:23:41] <twb> toretto: "[has] made me hungry"
[08:23:57] <twb> toretto: well, I guess LuisP18's sentence is also valid
[08:24:12] <twb> it's perhaps a little sociolectal
[08:25:10] <twb> "All this a-huggin and a-kissin has [got[ten]] me rarin to go"

[10:02:56] <furrykef> "are ran" is ungrammatical because the past participle of "run" is "run", not "ran"
[10:03:23] <furrykef> It conjugates run, ran, run
[10:04:39] <furrykef> But "used" would be better than "run" in any case. Though I like twb's suggestion more.

[16:29:41] <kurahaupo> Samian: "To run multiple GPUs" is missing a critical preposition: "To run (something) on99,99 multiple GPUs"
[16:31:21] <Samian> You can run many things. You can run a computer. You can run a program on a computer. You can run an extension on a browser on a computer.
[16:31:37] <Samian> Just because you can run X on Y doesn't mean you can't also run Y.
[16:32:43] <Samian> The question is whether you can run a GPU without specifying what's being run on it. Language allows this.
[16:34:04] <Samian> Indeed, it takes multiple sentences to cover the five W's.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws).  The fact that almost all the W's are not answered by a sentence does not make the sentence invalid.
