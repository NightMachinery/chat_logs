Accordingly, we restrict our sample to childbearing women (women who were pregnant during our medical history sampling window, see the...
[01:54:00] <gwern> ...following text). While reducing sample size, this ensures nearperfect fidelity in TG measurement, as all individuals should have been tested and thus an individual‚Äôs TG status is actually known (i.e., ensuring a comparison of TGpositive individuals versus TGnegative individuals, rather than versus the combined pool of TGnegative and TGunknown). Overall our data cover 11,433 ventures,...

[03:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The "adversarial lecture" stuff is obviously Vassar
[03:48:16] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Digging through rivers of bullshit in rationalist comment threads and pulling out the gems is your *job*, though. It's what you did for Slate Star Codex, and it's what you've done in the past for LessWrong.
[03:48:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the point (which, by the way, I explicitly made in that big thread) is that if your psyche is properly bug-fixed, then no Vassar can drive you crazy like that
[03:48:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because you have mental fortitude and integrity
[03:49:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And aren't prone to being shocked into madness when someone reveals your inconsistencies to you
[03:49:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, this is basically points I've made except in the form of a parable

[04:03:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> If what is given is not to his liking, he has but himself to blame
[04:04:30] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I want to like this post, but holy shit, the reason everyone converges on the "don't listen to the hostile AI" Schelling Point is because the assumption is that the AI is smarter than you and will be able to find a way around any kind of limits you set up for it. In this analogy, if the AI is Vassar, Vassar is a smart man, and the average rationalist, comparatively, is quite
[04:04:32] <quanticle> dumb. So the only logical thing to do is to *not listen to Vassar*, even if that means giving up on acquiring knowledge, because by listening to him, you don't know what else you're getting.
[04:05:30] <quanticle> This idea about, "Oh, it'll be safe if only we set up the right preconditions," is right up there with, "You can make a safe wish with a hostile djinni, if only you're careful about wording the wish correctly."
[04:06:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[04:06:25] <pompolic> how many SD of intelligence someone needs to be above before you gotta consider them a superintelligence?
[04:06:50] <pompolic> this is something that unironically occurs to me as a question, sometimes
[04:06:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, beyond 3 or so SD you can't even measure it accurately
[04:06:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> So that question is mostly meaningless

[08:22:21] <PlanckWalk> EH, if you add it up I've probably wasted far more of my time in hobbies with less productive output.
[08:22:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm very bad at adverserial thinking. How do I make adverserial thinking a habit when planning things and dealing with people?
[08:23:14] <PlanckWalk> Have you considered the zeroth question there?
[08:23:16] <PapuaHardyNet> adverserial thinking = planning for people as adverseries, and planning for bad scenarios
[08:23:33] <PapuaHardyNet> PlanckWalk: the zeroth question?
[08:23:40] <PlanckWalk> The one before the first question.
[08:24:09] <PlanckWalk> Such as: "is it a good idea to make adversarial thinking a habit?"
[08:24:45] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, I think it is. It would save me a lot of time, resources, and heartache
[08:25:27] <PlanckWalk> Fair enough
[08:26:41] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps the first thing I should start with is more aggressive multiple scenario planning, with a focus on worst case scenarios. Adverserial thinking is basically a subset of this
[08:26:57] <PlanckWalk> Ahh, that's definitely useful.
[08:28:18] <PlanckWalk> I like the working backward brainstorming approach of "It all went wrong. What likely caused that?"
[08:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (premortem analysis)
[08:28:51] <PlanckWalk> That's the phrase!  Thanks :)
[08:28:58] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, that's a nice term for it
[08:29:22] <PapuaHardyNet> although, I'm not quite sure how I should operationalize it. One way would be to make a daily habit to sit down, mentally list all the currently running plans, and apply multiple scenario planning if I feel like my plans aren't antifragile enough
[08:29:40] <PapuaHardyNet> but that doesn't plan itself doesn't seem very rocksolid
[08:29:51] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting, I can apply this to the habit of applying this

[08:32:06] <PlanckWalk> I've read a couple of books about planning things (at least in programming) that break things down into categories, but obviously much of it doesn't apply to "plans in general".

[08:35:03] <PlanckWalk> The general approach of trying to identify risks and for each one thinking of a vague likelihood and impact isn't bad.
[08:36:00] <quanticle> What's the risk of this strategy leading to analysis paralysis?
[08:36:02] <PlanckWalk> AT least that can help narrow down to the risks that are both likely and severely impact your plans, so you can mitigate those first.
[08:38:28] * PlanckWalk writes down analysis paralysis: likelihood=high, impact=fatal.  Mitigation: time-limit this analysis!
[08:39:28] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I think the bigger risk is creating an overly complex or fragile habit or system to do this
[08:40:00] <PapuaHardyNet> it needs to be something that gives the maximum amount of benefit while being the least costly in terms of physiological resources
[08:40:29] <PapuaHardyNet> a daily habit seems like the obvious constraint, second, a time-limit
[08:40:57] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps a 5 minute daily "running plans premortem analysis" habit?
[08:41:23] <PlanckWalk> Guess it depends how many plans you have and how often they change?

[13:56:48] <LeoTal> I've had many conversations where someone's like "he wore the same shirt as yesterday" or "she had a stain on her trousers" or "omg he wore plaid with stripes" or "she doesn't hold her fork properly" and I'm like "wtf how did you notice that"
[13:58:03] <mst> capisce: POD PERSON

[14:00:29] <LeoTal> Bad hygiene (e.g. a bad smell) I understand; many people (not me though) can wear the same shirt two days in a row without uncleanliness, and a small stain on clothing is normal
[14:01:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "many people (not me though) can wear the same shirt two days in a row without uncleanliness" ... yeah that's certainly what they tell themselves, and that's exactly why they need to be gossipped about

[14:04:03] <capisce> "It's extremely rude in my opinion when people simply don't turn their cameras on in virtual meetings. Unfortunately, no one at my workplace except me does."
[14:04:12] <capisce> how is his belief that people are rude paying rent here?
[14:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not a belief, it's a judgment
[14:05:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> He is judging them as rude
[14:05:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> A judgment in this context is a sort of summary evaluation of a person's characteristics against some standard
[14:06:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> The quoted line boils down to a claim that this person's standard is the correct one
[14:06:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that it should be accepted, followed, and enforced by others
[14:06:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And/or, an attempt to create common knowledge that this is *already* the case)
[14:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which, if successful, reinforces the dominance of the standard)
[14:10:02] <mst> yeah, I disagree with him but I don't find anything remotely odd about him making a judgement based on his opinion of what the standard should be
[14:12:57] <capisce> seems he's judging the people to be rude for following an implicit rule (at least at that company)
[14:13:13] <capisce> which seems a bit strange
[14:13:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't exactly agree that not turning on your camera is *rude*, but I will say that it imposes a hardship on some people
[14:13:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is way, *way* harder for me to follow a conversation by voice alone
[14:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> If there's no video, it's pretty much guaranteed that I will miss large swaths of what's said
[14:14:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it's much more of a strain to even try to follow it
[14:14:36] <capisce> from various comments and studies it seems that enforcing video also imposes hardship on some people
[14:14:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, I don't doubt that and indeed that's true even for me!
[14:15:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Competing access needs are a bitch
[14:19:20] <kuudes> it seems very rarely anyone in my employer uses camera aside management
[14:19:36] <kuudes> there are stills of our id card images though
[14:21:39] <kuudes> I guess I rather dislike those social people and sort of hope they go work somewhere else O_o
[14:22:53] <capisce> maybe that's a rather common finnish attitude :p
[14:24:07] <capisce> so what should the norm be when some people hate turning on cameras and others hate people not turning them on?
[14:24:08] <kuudes> I mean, he says its rude, I say he is rude by saying so
[14:24:50] <capisce> probably he should switch to a company of people who enjoy video calls
[14:24:59] <kuudes> that would be nice sortation
[14:25:20] <kuudes> I mean, if a company can force people to wear company colors while working, then they can force them to keep their camera on or off as well
[14:25:27] <capisce> question is at what interview round to ask about this
[14:25:33] <kuudes> yes
[14:25:39] <capisce> is it awkward to ask about all sorts of pet peeves already during the first interview?
[14:26:14] <kuudes> I have just turned down all interviews that have not offered full remote
[14:26:31] <capisce> makes sense, although that's a more common preference nowadays

[14:28:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, look, if you keep your cameras off, some people are going to receive minimal benefit from the meeting
[14:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's just a fact
[14:28:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Talking about what is or is not "rude" misses the point completely

[14:28:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, if you keep your cameras off, some people will experience the meeting as very stressful and exhausting
[14:28:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, the same is true if you keep your cameras on
[14:28:48] <kuudes> what's the benefit? surely the agenda of the meeting is the issue, not faces?
[14:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> These are all just plain facts
[14:28:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Devoid of judgment
[14:29:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Scroll up, I just explained it
[14:29:17] <kuudes> I feel it is a larger problem that people usually have unfocused meetings
[14:29:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's an unrelated issue
[14:29:41] <kuudes> also meetings are too long and have too many people
[14:29:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, it exacerbates things, certainly, by making the meetings longer than they could be
[14:29:46] <mst> some people receive substantial benefit from facial expressions etc. - other people would really rather not
[14:29:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I agree with that too
[14:29:52] <mst> competing access needs is the correct framing
[14:30:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (with "too long, too many people", that is)
[14:30:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah, the bottom line here is that the facts I listed are just facts, and no amount of "this is rude" "no this is not rude" will rid you of them
[14:31:03] <kuudes> I notice work meetings rarely are actual decision making gatherings, but rather information from people to other people
[14:31:43] <kuudes> I remember when I have been to actual multiparty decision meetings in politics or association stuff, you need to have specific structure and keep notes etc
[14:31:59] <kuudes> and there are rules such as asking for turn to talk etc
[14:32:23] <kuudes> basicly as long as I am just expected to listen in a meeting I see no reason for anyone to see my face
[14:32:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, one obvious mitigation here is to (a) have shorter meetings (enforced in various ways), (b) have fewer meetings, (c) rigorously keep notes
[14:32:33] <capisce> Obormot\Arcturus: yep, but there seems to be no good protocol to navigate these conflicts of interest atm
[14:32:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> The structure stuff kuudes is talking about could be beneficial but is not unambiguously so

[14:33:02] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[14:33:11] <capisce> which is part of why work is so exhausting
[14:33:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> It always ends up shaking out in such a way as to benefit whoever's in power
[14:33:22] <kuudes> or rather, I see a possible proper right for the manager to see the face of the orderly they are discussing with, but I see no intrisic right for employees to demand to see each others faces
[14:33:39] * Obormot\Arcturus facepalm
[14:33:53] <mst> kuudes: IME, decision making meetings are best approached by getting the decision made via backchannels beforehand and then the meeting is used to create a record of the arguments and a rubber stamp on the conclusion
[14:33:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes did you read what I wrote though
[14:34:27] <kuudes> mst, often, yes, though discussion can actually happen also in decision meetings. but it is nontrivial, yes
[14:34:43] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: at my uni, some profs / supervisors DEMAND you leave your camera on when speaking to them
[14:34:59] <PapuaHardyNet> so what you see is already a reality
[14:35:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, this is only to be expected
[14:35:20] <kuudes> yes, and that feels often insane to me. but people in other countries are often weird
[14:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's perfectly sane
[14:35:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a demand for submission, as a way of reinforcing a status hierarchy
[14:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't get any saner than that
[14:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's literally the basis of most human interaction

[14:36:29] <kuudes> in some ways, low power distance people are more free than high power distance people
[14:36:35] <mst> I wish I understood why actual face to face discussion is so much less annoying to me than video calls
[14:36:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Anyway, making this point again: I, personally, find following conversations much harder via voice only than via voice+video. That's not about "rights", it's just how my brain works. And I'm not the only one
[14:36:52] <kuudes> I like video calls with my friends
[14:37:04] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, indeed, I appreciate that
[14:37:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Same, and I have some theories about this but they're no more than that
[14:37:12] <kuudes> that is why Teams highlights the current speaker
[14:37:17] <kuudes> which seems rather ok to me
[14:37:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, how does that help
[14:37:31] <kuudes> you have the picture of the speaker, and it has highlight around it, and gets focused
[14:37:42] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I find video calls more effort to attend at all than audio calls but yes, easier to follow
[14:37:44] <kuudes> it helps that you get visual confirmation on who said what
[14:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: That's not solving the problem though
[14:37:59] <mst> personally if I can't have face to face I'd generally rather just discuss via text
[14:38:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: 100% same
[14:38:09] <mst> but of course that hurts the neurotypicals even worse
[14:39:56] <mst> there's a similar fun problem in terms of people who work better off diagrams versus people who work better off (e.g.) bullet points
[14:40:21] <kuudes> video calls are better than in-person meetings in that you can actually share your screen and other people will see it close and properly
[14:40:39] <kuudes> in in-person you can usually at most put your screen to some viewscreen etc
[14:40:42] <mst> e.g. I find a file of 'CREATE TABLE' statements much easier to consume than an ERD but appreciate that lots of people can much more easily understand a (well formatted) ERD
[14:40:55] <kuudes> which is much worse to look at than looking at your own computer screen
[14:41:10] <capisce> for me text > voice > video
[14:41:38] <kuudes> I don't want to wear pants at home.
[14:41:50] <kuudes> also I like to eat while in meeting
[14:41:53] <capisce> kuudes: but you don't need to turn on camera to share screens
[14:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sharing screen is awkward and annoying
[14:42:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Much worse than meeting in person around a computer (+whiteboard)
[14:42:43] <capisce> it's indeed slightly annoying, but still less uncomfortable than video calls for me
[14:43:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Anyway my theories for why in-person feels so much than video better have to do with (a) sound isolation [that may not be the right term, I am not a sound engineer], (b) camera field of view, (c) perception of shared space (due to peripheral vision and other cues)
[14:44:04] <capisce> you have to worry about whether you've turned off any app that might show private notifications, and don't accidentally show some tab with personal information etc
[14:44:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: This all contributes to the bandwidth being *much* lower, and squeezing interaction into a lower-bandwidth *but still synchronous* channel is stressful and lossy
[14:44:47] <capisce> also the fact that you notice how other people are or aren't looking at you irl
[14:45:11] <mst> I think maybe lack of (c) contributes to the *artificiality* of the experience and there's maybe an analogy to Uncanny Valley issues that would fit
[14:45:23] <capisce> seeing people's faces looking at their screens is far from the same thing
[14:45:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Yes, matching gaze (and other gestural cues) to spatial perception is another one
[14:46:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: I am the kind of person who tends to move around when at an in-person meeting, stand up, sit on things, gesture with hands, etc., and all of that is mostly absent in videoconferencing
[14:46:55] *** cache is now known as cacheyourdreams
[14:47:04] <mst> oh, yes, getting the camera right so I can wave my arms about effectively is annoying ;)
[14:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... related to this: over the past ... almost 2 years (god, has it been that long??), my friends and I have been D&Ding via Discord video, and early on I figured out that I should have my camera set up such that it can see my room, and then get up and DM while standing, walking around, etc.
[14:48:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which makes it *vastly* better
[14:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, night and day
[14:48:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not think I could do it if I just had to sit in a chair all the time

[15:40:47] <Gurkenglas> I hear that you can spoof the sender IP, but a country could just force its routers to check whether the sender IP matches the source cable, right?
[15:42:40] <kuudes> yes. and you don't get spam from finland, I think
[15:43:06] <kuudes> because over here operators are legally ordered to prevent outgoing smtp from their networks but to their own smpt server
[15:44:05] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, but the problem is that iirc smtp works so that anyone can smtp any machine for any target mails, and the receiving smtp server just takes a new smtp to closer server
[15:44:43] <Gurkenglas> i don't quite follow. finland only lets certified mail servers send mails, you mean?
[15:44:50] <kuudes> so I can send mail to Gurkenglas@Gurkenglas.com to telco.com and then telco.com will attempt to send it again to Gurkenglas.com
[15:45:11] *** Quits: Robomot (~Robomot@user/robomot) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:45:21] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, in finland there is a ban for port 25 outgoing but for the network operator designated machine
[15:45:56] <kuudes> you can still send spam, but at least botnets can't send spam just through smtp
[15:46:11] <Gurkenglas> because the botnets don't usually manage to infect the designated machine?
[15:46:43] <kuudes> no, the operator can monitor the volume of mails and shut out a customer who tries to send 10000 mails in minute
[15:47:02] <kuudes> ie unplug their connection automatically
[15:47:33] <Gurkenglas> couldn't the operator (who exactly is that?) do that regardless of the port 25 outgoing ban?

[15:49:47] <Gurkenglas> and finland presumably enforces that ban by forcing every router to discard smtp packets on non-whitelisted cables
[15:50:08] <kuudes> no, that is just consumer connections
[15:50:11] <mst> kuudes: I also remember in one particularly stupid case back at $ISP we not only nerfed their ability to continue sending outgoing mail but also disabled and force disconnecting the DSL connection that had an open realy at the bottom of it
[15:50:42] <kuudes> but indeed telcos are licenced, so they can be punished if there is malware traffic from them against regulations

[15:55:24] <kuudes> spamming is not criminal nor even illegal in some jurisdictions

[16:26:19] <PapuaHardyNet> 1. child porn subscriptions. this organization got 40$ per month subscriptions from 5 figure number of people from US at its height. That's a lot of fucking money. yes, spam emails was the sales funnel. Yes, it was on clearnet
[16:27:45] <PapuaHardyNet> 2. unlicensed medical prescriptions (not drugs). One man, Paul Le Roux, went from a veracrypt dev (or equivalent) to a freaking kingpin by selling drugs with fake prescriptions. They didn't use spam emails, of course, but this is another business model that were used by 
[16:28:07] <PapuaHardyNet> used by Eastern european criminal orgs
[16:28:40] <PapuaHardyNet> 3. distributing malware to create botnets. People paid for access to those spam lists to distribute their malware and botnets

[18:14:55] <kuudes> other than usa, often yes
[18:15:22] <nshepperd2> governments record legal names which are "official" in some sense but society still accepts common names that are different

[18:16:50] <kuudes> there exists a lot of prescriptivism

[18:19:30] <kuudes> in finland, iirc legally you have to name your kid to have a finnish name or your local culture name
[18:19:39] <kuudes> so axi would not be allowed
[18:20:11] <kuudes> and indeed if you don't name your kid legally, your kid will be taken in custody for the hour when officials name you kid and then reverse custody. you will get an official letter of this
[18:20:45] <kuudes> so yes, no one here can have a picture of chihuhahua as their name
[18:22:05] <ggreer> we don't accept hyphenated names. we accept one hyphen. if we actually accepted hyphenated names, we'd have family trees of hyphens in our last names

[19:33:29] <kuudes> https://www.statista.com/statistics/633660/unemployment-rate-of-recent-graduates-in-the-us/ says usa normally has about 3-4% unemployment of graduates

[19:34:21] <rmmh> unemployment is one of the most manipulated government metrics 
[19:34:37] <rmmh> it's nearly useless apart from the deltas 
[19:34:39] <ggreer> the criteria used in vincent's article is "responded to lambda school's survey, sought a job, and now has a job paying >$50k/year"
[19:35:09] <ggreer> they use sentences like "Of the 743 enrolled students in the report, only 147 students are shown to have gotten jobs paying at least $50k/yr."
[19:35:23] <kuudes> whats that compared to national median?
[19:36:00] <kuudes> rmmh, finland generally has larger unemployment than usa afaik
[19:36:18] <kuudes> so it feels surprising to me that in educated workforce the situation suddenly is reversed

[19:37:30] <kuudes> also students can't be unemployed basically

[21:30:33] <rmmh> I saw something claiming that the union armorers were on strike and they were using scabs
[21:31:28] <gwern> that's covered a bit in the link. but it looks like that was only the first step, and the most critical failure was the assistant director, who's being blamed for having a history of recklessness
[21:31:46] <rmmh> part of their demands were more focus on safety :I
[21:32:11] <gwern> yeah, it's a bad look, but the asst is the final link. he is handed the gun, supposed to check it solely for being unloaded, and then hand it to the actor
[21:32:31] <gwern> if he has a history and now all his enemies are leaking gossip and accusations...
[21:33:30] <kiboneu> yeah you're always going to have idiots
[21:33:35] <kiboneu> or humans
[21:33:58] <kiboneu> one has to make a system to account for that
[21:34:14] <gwern> I assume he's not going to pay the legal settlements, that's what the insurers are for, but it looks like all of the blame is going to attach to him. "he was responsible for the lack of safety, the unhappy union workers, and then was handed the fatal gun and failed to check it was empty as was his solumn and primary duty"
[21:34:21] <gwern> at the least, his career is over
[21:34:22] <feep> sure but ultimately your system is executed on humans
[21:34:41] <feep> if given a system, the people you give it to decide "actually we will do a different, less safe system" there is not much your system can do about it
[21:35:17] <gwern> right now I'm more wondering if he's going to catch any charges or a civil lawsuit

[21:35:56] <gwern> a pretty well-liked woman is dead
[21:36:06] <vrs> a prop gun is going to end up being fired so to me the most critical part really is making sure it contains no live rounds?
[21:36:46] <gwern> (it wasn't supposed to be fired, it sounds like it was just that drawing it, baldwin happened to hit the trigger hard enough to fire or maybe instinctively did so?)
[21:37:06] <vrs> process-design wise I mean
[21:37:26] <kiboneu> feep: that sort of depends, i think
[21:37:43] <vrs> gun-safety downstream is kind of pointless if some of the scenes involves firing the gun at people
[21:38:01] <kiboneu> it depends on who in the organizational hiearchy has the right sensitivites and courage to point out anomalies
[21:38:14] <gwern> yeah, I'm not totally convinced this is optimal either. with all those billions of SFX and whatnot, can real live ammunition still truly be necessary? instead of this crazy one-check-at-a-time system, why not have guns physically incapable of firing? or at least, physically incapable of firing regular bullets and only very special unique blank designs?
[21:38:20] <mst> gwern: also depends if there was an actual armourer
[21:38:20] <kiboneu> but selecting for such people is a system in itself
[21:38:48] <mst> but the production sounds shoddy enough safety wise that an asst. director with a history of not giving a shit was probably a deliberate hiring choice
[21:38:52] <kiboneu> gwern: yeah using live rounds at all seems like such bs, considering the tricks filmmakers have in their bag for such things
[21:38:54] <gwern> (you can't see *inside* a gun, so excuses about 'realism' can't wash. the prop people can surely make a perfect exterior)

[22:09:58] <kiboneu> all in its right time
[22:10:02] <kiboneu> yeah
[22:10:21] <mst> the trick is to respond sufficiently strongly to -surprise- people, but not so strongly you overreach and get fucked
[22:10:30] <pompolic> my current place generally listens to me, so that's nice
[22:10:38] <mst> however the more of a reputation for doing that you already have, the further you can push things, generally
[22:11:25] <pompolic> also: what if managing reputation is an unacceptable overhead?
[22:11:41] <mst> another way to look at it is "my reaction to hating politics was to get sufficiently good at it that apart from the occasional burst of focused playing I can make it go away"
[22:11:52] <kiboneu> pompolic: then you're not weaving the machinery to upkeep your rep to how you normally do things enough
[22:12:03] <mst> executed correctly I find the reputation management stuff significantly less overhead than the things I'd have to deal with otherwise would be
[22:12:11] <pompolic> makes sense
[22:12:50] <kiboneu> anyway. FOCUS TIME. closing irc. will read backlog. ttyl fellas
[22:12:51] <mst> in a situation where I can't make that happen, the better answer is to accept the overhead of the status quo
[22:13:12] <mst> I don't always succeed, because sometimes I just get fucking annoyed and decide I'm going to smash the board anyway and risk the consequences
[22:13:30] <mst> how rational that turns out to be in any given situation is debatable

[22:20:09] <pompolic> i wonder if on average people underestimate or understimate the impact of status
[22:20:39] <pompolic> i want to say "people overestimate it due to saliency" but i'm not all that sure
[22:20:54] <pompolic> Robin Hanson makes the case that it does affect a lot of things
[22:21:01] <pompolic> or rather, that it is rather impactful

[22:22:25] <ggreer> an actual smart prop gun that didn't fire if pointed at another human being is doable, but it would have to look like a sci-fi gun (since it needs cameras)
[22:22:40] <ggreer> also it's kinda dangerous because you could flip the bit of "is pointed at a person" and make an aimbot gun
[22:25:27] <pompolic> if people were to overestimate it, i think by discarding status considerations, you could increase your gains by instead searching for methods of accomplishing your goals that have more leverage
[22:26:06] <pompolic> s/underestimate or underestimate/underestimate or overestimate/g
[22:27:43] <pompolic> similarly, if people were to underestimate it, you could go far by maxing status, but that seems hard (because there is a lot of competition for status, which makes me less sure that people underestimate it)

[22:33:26] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Barth√©lemy came into contact with Karl Marx and Wilhelm Liebknecht. They met at an establishment in Rathbone Place, popular with French exiles, where fencing and pistol shooting were taught and practiced and where Barth√©lemy coached Marx in fencing.[5] Barth√©lemy visited Karl and Jenny Marx at their apartment several times although Jenny Marx disliked him intensely.[8]
[22:33:26] <feepbot> Barth√©lemy was also an associate of the German radical August Willich. According to Wilhelm Liebknecht, Willich and Barth√©lemy plotted to kill Marx for being too conservative.[8] In 1850, Willich publicly insulted Marx and challenged him to a duel, which Marx refused to fight.' <-- figures. the *one* good thing in this dude's life that he might've accomplished, he failed
