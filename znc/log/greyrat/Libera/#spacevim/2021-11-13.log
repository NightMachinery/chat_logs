[12:37:53] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> hi
[12:38:24] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg:matrix.org> @RenzoTincopa please just ask.
[20:00:11] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Hey there,
[20:00:12] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> I have some problems with SpaceVim while trying to set it up for C++ developement:
[20:00:13] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> I just can't figure out, why syntax checking won't work. I tried all the available syntax checking engines, but SpaceVim always behaves the same and won't check anything. I only wants to use Neomake, and that seems to be broken.
[20:00:14] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> On top of that, the clang syntax highlighting also doesn't work properly (It won't fully highlight my file), and no matter what engine I choose in the "checker" layer, everything stays the same and currently only regex somewhat woks.
[20:00:16] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> What am I doing wrong? I am completely out of ideas.
[20:00:17] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> I will upload my config below.
[20:00:18] <SpaceVimBot> <ultrablack_:matrix.org> Thanks!
