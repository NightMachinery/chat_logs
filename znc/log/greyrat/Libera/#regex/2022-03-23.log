[00:49:53] <macksfield> goodness, i just found out i worked on something for hours because my co-worker told me the wrong thing T_T
[00:52:16] <macksfield> I asked him a question about the requirements
[00:52:26] <macksfield> and he answered 
[00:52:30] <macksfield> i show him results later
[00:52:37] <macksfield> and he's like, wait - why didn't you do X?
[00:52:59] <macksfield> and I'm like, I asked about X, you said to do Y
[00:53:21] <macksfield> "well i just looked at <document-we-both-have>"
[00:53:46] <macksfield> yea dude, that's why I asked a question about it. Maybe you shouldnt' answer one way if you don't actually know :|
[00:59:37] <OnlineCop> Heh.
[00:59:47] <OnlineCop> Well, at least you learned something in the meantime.

[04:58:36] <re101-insect-63> thank you!!!!
[05:07:15] <re101-insect-63> the expression does not work if there is multiple "_". in this example "TF_12_NI_6058_AVG_R1" I need to extract 4th "_"
[05:07:47] <re101-insect-63> Â I need to extract from the 4th "_" to the first character
[05:07:48] <OnlineCop> Is the number of characters you're extracting the same (or nearly the same) every time? Such as "8 characters"?
[05:08:23] <OnlineCop> \b(TF(?:_[^_]+){4})
[05:08:28] <re101-insect-63> no it varies
[05:08:35] <OnlineCop> Now, you can change {4} to any other number that you want.
[05:09:13] <re101-insect-63> can I add parallel OR expression to catch multiple matches
[05:09:37] <OnlineCop> Sure. Just put the "|" pipe inside the outer (...) parentheses.

[14:22:58] <ozzi_van_nozzi> Hello guys,
[14:22:58] <ozzi_van_nozzi> do you know a possibility to compare a sequence with the longest subsection of a reference?
[14:22:59] <ozzi_van_nozzi> Let' say my reference is '123456'. So if the sequence is '1', then the '1' should be matched, if '12' then '12'. For '124' only '12' should be matched and for '323456', nothing should be matched, because the previous character has always to be matched to compare the next one.
[14:22:59] <ozzi_van_nozzi> Of course, I could hard code it like '1|12|123|1234|12345|123456'. I thought, there might be a more clever way, though. Back references like (1)|(\12)|(\23)|(\34)|(\45)|\56 do not seem to work.

[17:44:01] <JimmyEatsWorld> would you mind explaining digitok your code as I am trying to learn
[17:45:42] <digitok> 07JimmyEatsWorld, my regex matches: a comma, followed by a group which matches 0 or more spaces followed by a comma - which is repeated 1 or more times
[17:46:07] <digitok> () is a group, (?:) is a non-capturing group, since we do not need to capture anything here, only match it. either will work
[17:48:25] <tercaL> digitok: What's different between "it matches, but does not capture" please? As both matches; https://regex101.com/r/tYTba2/1 and https://regex101.com/r/tYTba2/2

[17:49:07] <tercaL> I don't get difference between "matches" and "captures/not captures" in terms of URL and filepath.
[17:50:16] <JimmyEatsWorld> thank you digitok. If I want to eliminate any whitespaces also, how could I accomplish this? https://regex101.com/r/R9AUro/1
[17:50:48] <JimmyEatsWorld> I will eventually then be able to use a replace function to include a space following the comma for normal formatting inside of a sentence.
[17:52:22] <digitok> the closest would probably be https://regex101.com/r/R9AUro/2
[17:53:09] <digitok> well, you could add a space to the replacement also
[17:53:26] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/R9AUro/3
[17:54:08] <digitok> 07tercaL, captures simply means it returns the substring as a group
[17:54:41] <digitok> both match the whole path, but /1 returns 3 groups containing the contents of the parts of the regex enclosed by ()'s

[17:54:50] <digitok> /2 returns 1 group, the extension

[17:56:12] <JimmyEatsWorld> how do I eliminate the space after sonny - if I wanted to do that?
[17:56:32] <JimmyEatsWorld> is there a way to specify that it will not highlight between lines?
[17:57:00] <digitok> meaning you want to preserve the newline in the output?
[17:58:27] <digitok> will the other spaces always be regular spaces, or could they also be tabs?
[18:04:14] <JimmyEatsWorld> good question, I think they may be CHAR(10) or spaces (if char10 means a line in ASCII)I need to look up
[18:05:50] <digitok> char 10 is a newline in ascii
[18:06:04] <digitok> but, that is the one you do not want to remove, correct?

[18:53:43] <Lope> ah, well if you scroll down halfway you'll see it there
[18:53:59] <Lope> Nice to see you online, OnlineCop :)
[18:54:01] <OnlineCop> Starting on which match?
[18:54:06] <Lope> Haven't seen you online in a long time.
[18:54:37] <Lope> If you scroll down halfway, the "real" sentence that I want is: Makhanda, commonly known as Grahamstown, is a town of about 140,000 people in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is situated about 110 kilometres northeast of Port Elizabeth an
[18:54:38] <Lope> d 130 kilometres southwest of East London.
[18:54:44] <OnlineCop> Oh, I'm almost always around (at least, the bouncer says I'm always around). I'm fighting a cold, so my brain is maxing out around 60%.
[18:55:08] <Lope> well no stress then, I mean I have my algo working
[18:55:13] <OnlineCop> Match 5, which comes within \"escaped\" double quotes?
[18:55:19] <Lope> but I always like opinions from the regex gurus.
[18:56:07] <Lope> It's showing up as Match 3 for me.
[18:56:29] <Lope> I don't want to make any assumptions about google's code
[18:56:48] <Lope> for example they might embed the "real" sentence within HTML tags, like >blah blah<
[18:57:01] <Lope> or they might do what they've done, which was throw it into some JavaScript.
[18:57:15] <Lope> that's why I wrote the regex to find what resembles a sentence.
[18:57:23] <Lope> It does of course have limitations.
[18:57:24] <OnlineCop> On version /4 ? I see [Find local businesses...], [click mousedown...], [Not enough storage...], [u003dmaps...], and then (match 5) [Makhanda, commonly...]
[18:57:37] <Lope> For example if the sentence contains international characters, I'd have a problem.
[18:57:52] <Lope> yes, version 4
[18:58:38] <Lope> So I'd say the only problem that I have with my regex, is it won't match international characters
[18:58:44] <OnlineCop> The regex flavor is ECMAScript?
[18:59:15] <Lope> Yes
[18:59:24] <Lope> So names like ValdepeÃ±as would not match
[18:59:54] <OnlineCop> Since `\w` includes all of the Unicode "letters", including digits and underscore, I find it easier to search for `[^\W_]` (any "word" character except underscore) and then do "or [,.]" (comma, period).
[19:00:17] <OnlineCop> But be sure to enable \u Unicode.
[19:00:20] <OnlineCop> Er, /u
[19:01:12] <Lope> ok I'll try that on https://regex101.com/r/Znv7AQ/1
[19:01:45] <Lope> However the first character of my thing looks for an uppercase letter
[19:01:50] <Lope> So I'll have to get rid of that.
[19:02:00] <Lope> Because it assumes uppercase ASCII
[19:02:26] <Lope> Note in https://regex101.com/r/Znv7AQ/1 I've edited the body text to include a sentence with a non ASCII name.
[19:02:49] <OnlineCop> Okay, good.
[19:03:47] <Lope> OnlineCop, this isn't matching the last word? https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/1
[19:04:01] <OnlineCop> !update
[19:04:12] <OnlineCop> Are you using Save Regex or Update Regex?
[19:04:31] <OnlineCop> It's a bit easier to see changes if you just bump the revision number with Update Regex.
[19:05:05] <OnlineCop> Which line is the non-ASCII name in the text?
[19:05:46] <Lope> Sorry, I was rusty with regex101.com. I'll use Update.
[19:05:58] <Lope> ValdepeÃ±as
[19:08:02] <OnlineCop> Well, that's disappointing. Switching to PCRE/PCRE2 with the /u (Unicode) flag matches "ValdepeÃ±as" along with the rest of the text, but without /u or with EMCAScript, it's not.
[19:08:48] <Lope> pl this seems to work: https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/2
[19:09:01] <Lope> ok* this seems to work: https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/2
[19:11:48] <OnlineCop> Odd.
[19:12:09] <OnlineCop> That should mean `\p{Lu}` should also work for uppercase letters.
[19:13:10] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/3
[19:13:46] <OnlineCop> You could prepend \b if you want to ensure a word boundary left of the uppercase letter.
[19:16:24] <Lope> OnlineCop, ok, thanks... but have you scrolled through https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/3 it's very broken.
[19:16:47] <OnlineCop> Broken, as in "has fewer matches"?
[19:18:57] <Lope> no, it doesn't match the "real" paragraph properly
[19:19:09] <Lope> and also matches a bunch of stuff that doesn't resemble proper sentences
[19:19:21] <Lope> But I used your idea, it works nicely: https://regex101.com/r/cZdNnt/4

[19:37:20] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: On regex101 on the left, use Unit Tests and enter in a bunch of your various "should"/"should not" match scenarios, then click "Update Regex" (below "Save Regex").

[19:38:27] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: No worries. Just didn't want you to get confused. That's why I'm prefixing names as I'm typing since there are 2-3 simultaneous conversations here.
[19:39:06] <OnlineCop> Lope: Any reason why you're using a (...){5,} capture group instead of ((?:...){5}) and capturing all the text into one single large group?
[19:40:27] <OnlineCop> Lope: If sentences end in other punctuation like ! ? Â¿ Â¡ â¸ do you want those to match as well?

[19:42:11] <OnlineCop> Lope: Typically, though, you'll have 2 or more letters before a '.' as in "Dr." or "Mrs." or "Ph.D" but not concurrent hyphens: "My-Hyphenated-Last-Names" instead of "My--Name".
[19:42:12] <Lope> which eliminates stuff like <strong> and </strong>
[19:42:35] <GeniusAtWork> I believe they're just looking to match strings no longer than 5 characters, so that should work
[19:42:53] <Lope> OnlineCop, I very much doubt the sentences will end in ? but good thinking of that anyway.
[19:43:06] <Lope> Because it's a definition sort of thing.

[19:52:32] <GeniusAtWork> just one single case, as all the conditions are true for me, this should work, but it is not. I'm definitely missing something and I think is in the second expression which is `^(/set-contestant$|/auth/|/enter/|/[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}/[a-z0-9\-]+$)` how you could improve this expression?

[19:58:07] <OnlineCop> re101-impala-16: Looks like you need to combine those string literals since the site doesn't like you using `"` while the delimiter is that same character.
[19:58:20] <Lope> OnlineCop, haha, you're very special :P
[19:58:40] <Lope> i gotta go, have a good eve
[19:58:43] *** Parts: Lope (~lope@user/lope) (Leaving)
[19:59:47] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: This is what I see if I break the expression apart and capture each of those sections individually with their own capturing groups: https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/2
[20:00:26] <OnlineCop> On the right, "MATCH INFORMATION" says that the match comes from group 3: `^/enter/`
[20:01:21] <GeniusAtWork> that's present in the path of the URL, that's enough to match
[20:01:35] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: By the way, you can change the delimiter on PCRE2 flavors from '/' to something else so you don't have to escape \/ everywhere. Just click that delimiter left of the pattern, and you can choose some other character.
[20:01:45] <GeniusAtWork> I think we need more details, the URL should have something else
[20:02:05] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: I don't understand what is matching/not matching correctly (or is matching but shouldn't). Could you update the TEST STRING with some examples?
[20:04:22] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: Are you trying to eliminate matches where `^/(tasks|sites)/` is found?
[20:05:31] <OnlineCop> GeniusAtWork: Most of your initial text was clobbered by IRC (or hidden by the bot for the spam), so I may be missing some of your initial requirements.
[20:07:25] <GeniusAtWork> they got a request from the following URL `https://gleam.io//enter/RsZUo/6255580` from an IP that belongs to ASN 4134, this ASN is specifiend in the rule, is a match. As you shared here https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/2 this matches on `/enter/` this is another match. Then third expression looks for the following `^/(tasks|sites)/` and none of this
[20:07:25] <GeniusAtWork> paths is in the URL, so all conditions are meet
[20:08:00] <GeniusAtWork> sorry if i am not being clear
[20:09:59] <GeniusAtWork> so si like, if the IP is in this ASN, then checks the regex https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/2 to see if there's any of the paths specified there, and then if they don't match `^/(tasks|sites)/` then take an action
[20:10:00] <OnlineCop> The `^/enter/` rule would mean that either of the `^/tasks/` or `^/sites/` rules will not match.
[20:10:44] <GeniusAtWork> correct I understand as, if doesn't have `^/tasks/` or `^/sites/` then is true
[20:10:47] <OnlineCop> The ^ anchor at the beginning means that the URL after the domain, as in `https://example.com`, would be the first thing the pattern sees.
[20:11:37] <GeniusAtWork> ok, then that confirms that the syntax of the regex is not the right one
[20:12:02] <OnlineCop> Do you want /tasks/ or /sites/ to match if they are found _anywhere_ inside the URL, not just at the beginning?
[20:12:18] <OnlineCop> If so, just remove the '^'.
[20:12:40] <GeniusAtWork> only in the path, as they're displayed as `/whatever/`\
[20:13:10] <OnlineCop> "path" versus...? the query perhaps?
[20:13:35] <GeniusAtWork> I guess they don't want to block what is coming either with `/tasks/` or `/sites/`
[20:14:55] <OnlineCop> This is what I think you had pasted initially (I see nothing else below it as the spam bot muted it after this point):
[20:15:00] <OnlineCop> > (ip.geoip.asnum in {...} and http.request.uri.path matches "^(/set-contestant$|/auth/|/enter/|/[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}/[a-z0-9\\-]+$)" and not http.request.uri.path matches "^/(tasks|sites)/")

[20:17:37] <OnlineCop> If I understand this: the IP has to match one of those. The URI path has to match one of those next patterns. The URI path also must NOT match one of `^/tasks/` or `^/sites/`.
[20:18:05] <OnlineCop> The only case where the 2nd and 3rd match together is in that `/[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}/[a-z0-9\\-]+$` condition.
[20:19:28] <GeniusAtWork> you got it
[20:19:37] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/3 ?
[20:21:06] <OnlineCop> That will not prevent https://example.com/foo/tasks/abcdefg from matching, since /foo/ is at the beginning of the Path, and `^/tasks/` will not match anywhere except at the beginning.

[20:29:01] <GeniusAtWork> I mean everything points that this expression here https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/3 is not well constructed on customers side, they have this https://regex101.com/r/nS3XTI/1
[20:29:54] <GeniusAtWork> the other two expression that look for the ASN and NOT match `/tasks/` or `/sites/` are ok
[20:30:54] <OnlineCop> Version /3 is the same as version /1, except that I made `/tasks/` and `/sites/` fail to match first. Your (ip.geoip.asnum ...) code above appears to include both of those.
[20:31:21] <OnlineCop> So your (ip.geoip.asnum ...) code should be functionally identical to version /3.
[20:32:04] <GeniusAtWork> the `ip.geoip.asnum` is only looking for ASN numbers...
[20:32:07] <OnlineCop> Whatever regex that supports probably doesn't understand the `(?!...)` lookahead, so it has to be written programmatically as "...and not http.request.uri.path matches ..."
[20:32:10] <GeniusAtWork> `(ip.geoip.asnum in {132525 136907 139726 17621 17622 17623 17816 23724 24400 24444 24445 24547 37963 399606 4134 45090 4808 4811 4812 4837 4847 55958 56040 56041 56042 56044 56046 56047 56048 9808}`

[21:05:50] <OnlineCop> The (...|) group means "We II" is optional; what should match if it's missing?
[21:06:55] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/cNfB24/2
[21:07:03] <rapha> well, it should match "We II" or "" ... some strings might be like, "54c, 123v" or even "last page" or "unreadable, second to last page"
[21:07:10] <OnlineCop> For whatever reason, your `\s` is matching the newline there.
[21:07:32] <OnlineCop> Having a lot more of those examples in your text would help, especially if you separate them into "should" and "shouldn't" match sections.
[21:08:01] <OnlineCop> [^#$] will match a newline character, by the way.
[21:08:12] <rapha> ah yeah these work badly when you give multiple examples of data ... because of \s matching \n as well
[21:08:31] <OnlineCop> `\h` is "horizontal only". Or you could use [ \t] (space, tab).
[21:08:45] <rapha> but i know that if my input data include a newline char, i have to treat it like a space char
[21:08:55] <rapha> still awesome to learn about \h
[21:09:37] <rapha> so, yours is a little better and i changed '###' into '#+' ... what still puts a match into the pr group tho is something like https://regex101.com/r/AiVS3C/1
[21:10:06] <rapha> let me change from \s to \h so i can put more examples into there
[21:10:24] <OnlineCop> Should 'We' occur at the start of the string?
[21:10:36] <OnlineCop> By the way, use 'Update Regex' instead of 'Save Regex'.
[21:11:35] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/AiVS3C/2
[21:11:50] <OnlineCop> I actually think it's the [^#$] that is matching the newline in several of those.
[21:12:32] <rapha> OnlineCop: okay, this is weird: https://regex101.com/r/dTGTDr/1 ... it seems to kinda lika match everything somehow

[21:12:49] <rapha> oh, and yes, i'll use update regex
[21:13:27] <rapha> and yes, removing the [^]
[21:13:33] <OnlineCop> "We" and "We II" should both fail to match?
[21:13:42] <rapha> er, [^#$] ... makes it less weird
[21:14:25] <rapha> yeah, "We", "We I", "We II" with nothing following them, should all fail to match. i mean, "We II" is allowed to match the first group, but not the second group.
[21:14:43] <OnlineCop> We(?:\h+I+)?
[21:14:54] <rapha> https://regex101.com/r/dTGTDr/2
[21:14:57] <rapha> oh, ok, lemme try that
[21:14:59] <OnlineCop> That will match "We", "We I", "We II", "We    IIIIIIII"
[21:16:20] <rapha> https://regex101.com/r/dTGTDr/3
[21:16:32] <OnlineCop> Since you've got quite a few edge cases, it might make more sense to write these up with the Unit Tests feature on the left.
[21:16:43] <rapha> aha
[21:16:48] <rapha> i never noticed that
[21:16:52] <OnlineCop> Then you can say "Should match ... text, and group 'cm' should (or should not) match ...", etc.
[21:17:05] <OnlineCop> Then you can keep those `\h` as `\s`.
[21:17:26] <rapha> man that is so cool this will make my life so much easier from now on!!
[21:17:51] <re101-insect-63> I have a string "Recovery Boiler Water + RECOVERY BOILER WATER CONDUCTIVITY + GEN BANK GAS OUTLET TEMP + RECOVERY BOILER WATER Ph" and I need an expression to substitute all "+" with a commas ","
[21:17:54] <OnlineCop> The Unit Tests get saved as well when you use Update Regex, so you can keep building what you need.
[21:18:04] <OnlineCop> re101-insect-63: Search for `\+` and replace with `,`
[21:18:06] <rapha> ok, that actually just calmed me down enough so that i can take a break and prep some food for my dad and i. thank you so much, OnlineCop!
[21:18:15] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.

[22:16:53] <re101-skunk-21> but if we've quotes like ("WE" or "US") Or ("Custodian")
[22:17:40] <OnlineCop> If you're matching literal '(' and ')' characters, the regex pattern needs you to escape them: \( or [(], \) or [)]

[23:56:02] <OnlineCop> re101-wombat-9: Regex101 uses your browser's native Javascript to perform the regexes; Safari doesn't support lookbehinds. Another browser, or try the .NET flavor (if you need variable-length lookbehinds) or PCRE (if you just want common functionality).
