[00:21:35] <Franciman> sorry
[00:22:05] <Franciman> initial segments of an ordered set (X, <) are sets of the type: I(a) = { x \in X : a < x }

[00:22:52] <somiaj> ahh I see, yea, maybe working with primes like I did will work, because you still have to then deal with things like 2*3, 2^2*3, 2*5, 2*7, and so on

[00:26:48] <somiaj> blackfield: ahh looks like you can just use Q, because you have initial segements like {x : x < sqrt(2)} (or { x : x < 0 or x^2 < 2 } )
[00:27:12] <somiaj> in essence in Q you can get an initial segment for every real number, so thus an uncountable number though Q is only a countalbe linear order.

[00:44:57] <biberao> i found a similar one

[00:45:10] <isekaijin> In the second book for 12th grade students, page 43, I found a section called “remarkable limits” or something like that.
[00:45:15] <biberao> yes
[00:45:24] <biberao> it means fundamental limits
[00:45:53] <isekaijin> But this stuff already assumes knowledge of derivatives.
[00:46:11] <biberao> we have the knowledge per se
[00:46:14] <isekaijin> The second book for 11th grade students covers limits, continuity and derivatives.
[00:46:18] <biberao> we cant apply them

[01:04:49] <isekaijin> If you're working with tensors, then it's advisable to only use indices (either subscript of superscript) to denote the components of a tensor. But “B” and “t” in “T^B_t” don't seem to denote components of anything.

[01:49:12] <tuskkk____> Hey everyone, don't know if this question fits here. I am looking for a solution on a puzzle I came across some days ago. The question was to put words within two boxes (left and right) based on a pattern given in the example. Like say there is a pattern ABC, some words were put in the right box (maybe because they ended with C) others in the left (maybe they started with A). I am not able to explain because I didn't understand the
[01:49:22] <tuskkk____> question fully as well.

[04:58:35] <SJrX> Apologies, it's been a while since I've been in school, and I never actually studied this topic, but hopefully this question makes sense, I have a set S of unknown size n, The elements of S are all random iid variables ~U(0,1). I can easily get the smallest, second smallest and mth smallest value, and what I want to know is how good an estimator the 1 divided by the mth smallest value is for n, as n grows larger. Ideally I'm looking for a
[04:58:36] <SJrX> formula I can plot, I guess I'm looking for the variance.
[04:59:43] <PlanckWalk> 1 / (mth smallest)?
[05:00:42] <SJrX> Yeah like lets look at just the smallest value from the set. If the smallest value is 0.1 then there are probably around 10 elements in the set. If the smallest value is 0.001 then there are probably 1000 elements in the set.
[05:00:48] <PlanckWalk> The range includes zero, so that's likely to have infinite variance.
[05:01:21] <SJrX> I vaguely recall in star trek technobable that these are called nth order statistics, and that the first order statistic has a lot of variance.
[05:01:45] *** Joins: vaporatorius (~vaporator@user/vaporatorius)
[05:02:13] <PlanckWalk> If you can get the m'th smallest for any m, can't you just binary search to find n?

[05:04:57] <PlanckWalk> Or some tradeoff of runtime for precision
[05:05:45] <PlanckWalk> Well, I guess you can do that
[05:06:19] <PlanckWalk> Like, the problem isn't much changed if you have a uniform distribution since you can just use the known cdf.
[05:07:00] <PlanckWalk> OH wait, it was U, not N
[05:07:10] <PlanckWalk> Heh

[05:16:10] <SJrX> yay!

[06:07:44] <SJrX> Thanks PlanckWalk!
[06:08:57] <SJrX> I guess one more question, I vaguely recall that we use standard deviation and variance because sqrt() and ^2 have nicer properties then just the just using the sum of absolute value of difference, but does the "sum of absolute value" difference have a name, I'm wondering if libre office has a function for it, since it's probably easier to explain what that is than standard deviation or variance.

[06:10:22] <SJrX> I guess I did notice in my graphs, that the estimator I'm using seemed to have a negative bias (or at least the average was very negative more often than not, for small values). So I guess there might be something about degrees of freedom that I might need to do but I never under stood that.

[06:16:25] <alphamule> "Sum of absolute values" reminds me of the Taxicab distance
[06:16:52] <alphamule> You add up all the lines you have to cross, to reach the intersection.
[06:17:56] <alphamule> If the lines are on a rectangular grid and aligned along N/S, E/W axis, then it's just the sum of the differences in x and y coordinates on the map.
[06:18:40] <alphamule> Technically, they don't have to be aligned on those angles, but 90-degree differences.
[06:19:03] <alphamule> (You can rotate the map)
[06:19:58] <alphamule> In real streets, you get something more akin to those path graphs.
[06:21:45] <isekaijin> SJrX: The sum of absolute values might be easier to explain, but the variance definitely has much nicer mathematical properties.

[14:08:05] <cadmio> R/I is simple in the case of it being a field
[14:08:13] <cadmio> then its only ideals are I/I and R/I
[14:09:20] <cadmio> that note seems to suggest that since R/I has 1: there's an element  a+I with a \notin I

[19:00:22] <biberao> ;)
[19:00:29] <laurus> Does saying that a) we set up the bases, and then b) using those, there exists an isomorphism, does that somehow prove that the two spaces are isomorphic?
[19:00:39] <cadmio> I proved 1.6.10 this way https://gioretikto.github.io/mat/algebra/ideal_generated.html (only 1st proof)

[19:02:14] <laurus> Since we can only get the a_{ij} through defining the bases
[19:03:00] <Z-module> laurus, "X and Y are isomorphic" simply means some isomorphism X -> Y exists. There are times when one can prove an isomorphism exists without actually displaying any particular such map.
[19:03:12] <laurus> Z-module: Is this such a case?
[19:04:39] <laurus> I can't tell if the bases are part of the space we're mapping from, or not
[19:05:27] <Z-module> cadmio: that first proof looks fine, but "an ideal J \in R containing I" should be  "an ideal J \subset R properly containing I".  Or just "an ideal J of R ..."
[19:05:42] <Z-module> ideals of a ring are always subsets of that ring, you don't need to mention it
[19:07:02] *** Quits: br1ck (~br1ck@150.140.193.82) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:07:06] <Z-module> The point is that if J is a *proper* ideal of R that properly contains I, then J/I is a proper ideal of R/I that properly contains I/I = the zero of the ring J/I.  Which can't happen in a field.
[19:07:34] *** Joins: X-Scale` (~ARM@89.214.146.79)

[19:10:29] <cadmio> the symbol J ⊲ R  already indicates that J is a proper ideal of R
[19:11:39] <Z-module> In math, unlike in ordinary speech, "subset of", "subspace of", "contains", and all such similar ideas are never *properly* by default. X is always a subset of X, etc. Every ideal J contains J.
[19:11:46] <Z-module> So if you mean properly, you have to specify it
[19:12:18] <Z-module> a rare exception is prime ideals and maximal ideals in rings: those are proper ideals by definition.

[19:18:00] <Z-module> OK, some do use  J < R   for ideals.

[22:26:27] <joel135> i see
[22:26:56] <Fangs> Brown representability is generally what you invoke to 'get' BG (or K(G,n) abelian G). I 'understood' the statement as saying ordinary cohomology with coefficients in some (abelian) group G satisfies the necessary hypothesis for a 'representing' object to exists
[22:28:00] <Fangs> joel135: so maybe spectra "are" what these K(G,n) supposed to be. they are what to other cohomology theory what eilenberg-mclane spaces are to ordinary cohomology

[23:36:34] <johnkeats6> should be possible to Just Do It
[23:37:28] <johnkeats6> the easy way is to say 1 is a regular value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 and so x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 is a submanifold
[23:38:16] <Franciman> yup,
[23:38:26] <johnkeats6> of course that's implicitly using the implicit function theorem
[23:38:39] <Franciman> then i should prove that the diff. structure given by this costruction, is the same of the stereographic projections
[23:38:48] <Franciman> (i don't know why i called them stereoscopic sorry lol)
