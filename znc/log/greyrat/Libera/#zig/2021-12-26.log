[19:03:23] <luuk> Oh wait, system libraries
[19:03:29] <luuk> Arch dynamically links those
[19:03:56] <luuk> You could try passing -DZIG_PREFER_CLANG_CPP_DYLIB=ON to CMAKE

[19:53:11] <Dko1905> Is there a cleaner solution to passing a stdout Writer to a function than `fn usage(w: @TypeOf(std.io.getStdOut().writer())) {`?

[21:07:38] <Dko1905> Currently zig(1) doesn't have any man pages, if I start writing some, how likely are they to be accepted?
[21:09:12] <ifreund> Dko1905: before the language and std are stable, no
[21:09:20] <ifreund> afterwards likely
[21:09:50] <ifreund> we don't want to add increased maintenece work through duplicating documentation at this point
[21:11:36] <Dko1905> The zig command line utility could use a better form of documentation, and shouldn't change too much.
[21:12:58] <Dko1905> s/and\ shouldn't/and it shouldn't/
[21:13:02] <ifreund> ah you mean docs for the toolchain itself, yes those are currently nonexistant asside from --help
[21:13:17] <Dko1905> thanks
[21:13:51] <ifreund> the only problem with a man page is that I don't think it would function on e.g. windows
[21:14:34] <ifreund> I think the way to go would be to start by adding toolchain docs to the main docs page, and eventually duplicate that content to man pages for users on unixy systems

[21:26:01] <Dko1905> help2man is a hack, it does an ok job at converting, but there are issues.
[21:26:50] <Dko1905> Call me old fashioned but documentation should primarily be read in man pages and not using --help.
[21:32:32] <ifreund> I agree, man pages are the only documentation for my personal projects
[21:32:49] <ifreund> the problem arises from targeting more than just unixy systems

[21:51:31] <Dko1905> help2man can help writing the initial man pages, but help2man shouldn't be responsible for maintaining the manual pages.
[21:54:57] <Dko1905> the --help flag could show the man page.

[22:06:49] <luuk> I disagree. --help should show status quo, whereas the manpages have their own 'thing'. 
[22:08:41] <luuk> I also agree with ifreund. Implementing manpages for the current state of the Zig project would increase the maintenance burden by a lot. Even the CLI is still changing often.
