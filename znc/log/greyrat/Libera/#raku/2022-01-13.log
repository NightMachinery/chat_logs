[02:27:30] <japhb> I didn't put the tab completion API in the README because I felt like it needed more work to go from Linenoise-level to really swanky 
[02:28:14] <japhb> (like showing docs next to possible expansions, or showing fill-in parameter lists, or so)
[02:28:36] <japhb> Still, if what you need is basic tab completion and history, it should handily do the job.
