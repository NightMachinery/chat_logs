[00:38:43] <TheWild> wait a sec, it's about order of the group, not the number of elements or am I missing something?
[00:39:14] <int-e> the order of a group is its number of elements
[00:39:32] <int-e> not to be confused with the order of a group element

[04:04:40] <motle> you would think it would be a set
[04:05:03] <tempate99> I have no idea how to show that a polynomial is irreducible, to be honest. In one variable it's obvious, but here it's tricky.
[04:05:38] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d46396.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[04:05:51] <motle> well you cant factorise it right
[04:06:54] <motle> id be more worried about not being able to understand about how to show V(F) is factorisable, im not sure the definition you gave is correct, it seems impossible to work with the zeros as a set and have them somehow be an irriducable polynomial
[04:07:47] <tempate99> I think V(F) = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}, which I guess is reducible because V_1 = {(0, 0)}, V_2 = {(1, 0)} and V(F) = V_1 U V_2
[04:08:38] <motle> oh, so its a set of more than one ellement, well thats simple enough, annoying how they use irriducable as applied to a polynomial and then strait after irriducable as applied to a set
[04:08:51] <tempate99> An algebraic set V is reducible if V = V_1 U V_2 with V_1, V_2 != V
[04:09:11] <tempate99> Yeah, right

[04:09:55] <tempate99> Another question would be whether it's possible for an algebraic set with more than one element to be irreducible
[04:10:17] <motle> so i dont see how you could have an reducable set of zeros from an irriducable polynomial
[04:10:39] <tempate99> I think we're missing something here
[04:11:03] <tempate99> Nevertheless, I don't think the polynomial being irreducible has anything to do with its zeros
[04:11:36] <motle> well normally you factorise a polynomial by finding its zeros and they righting a factor for each right?
[04:12:24] <tempate99> well, sure, but the polynomial has the same zeros when it's factored than when it isn't
[04:12:27] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Quit: Leaving)

[04:13:50] <tempate99> I don't think it is (if you account for the factor's multiplicity), but what does that have to do with anything?
[04:14:15] <cherim> The question is over R, not C
[04:14:26] <motle> oh, ok if theres some degeneracy then maybe you can get it to work...

[12:12:27] <int-e> yes.
[12:12:55] <zacts> int-e: yes to which?
[12:13:21] <int-e> Both, really.
[12:13:50] <int-e> You can take the Peano axioms, and induction will be an axiom schema, or an axiom if you use a higher order logic.
[12:14:11] <int-e> Or you can construct the natural numbers in your favorite set theory and induction on them will be a theorem.
[12:19:52] <zacts> so.. via the set theory approach mathematical induction wouldn't be a directly stated axiom?
[12:20:12] <zacts> it would be a theorem that is proven from simpler elements?
[12:23:09] <schillingklaus> induction over natural numbers is not the one and only induction.

[12:26:07] <zacts> ok
[12:26:44] <zacts> but in the set theory approach, mathematical induction isn't a directly stated axiom like it is in the Peano axioms.
[12:26:58] <int-e> (in set theory, the natural numbers are typically represented as 0 = {}, 1 = {0} = {{}}, 2 = {0,1} = {{},{{}}}, 3 = {0,1,2} and so on...). To get the natural number, one takes the intersection of all sets with that property (inductive sets). And then you get, as a (very easy) theorem, that every inductive set contains the natural numbers.
[12:27:51] <int-e> Which corresponds to the usual induction on the natural numbers.
[12:27:59] <zacts> ok

[14:07:09] <alphamule> BASIC has LET command :D

[14:09:30] <dextaa> I have K is finitely axiomatisable (but Phi could be infinite)
[14:09:35] <dextaa> so I guess that makes it easier
[14:14:43] <joel135> Another problem is that Phi' may have to be a subset of the closure of Phi under this Galois connection, rather than a subset of simply Phi. Sure, you could take the intersection with Phi, but maybe this intersection is too 'inarticulate' to capture K' well. I think this is the more interesting concern.

[16:32:42] <tempate99> rubiksdream: to be honest the mere distinction of k[X][Y] and k(X)[Y] is confusing
[16:33:11] <rubiksdream> k(X)[Y] is a PID which is essential for the existence of h_1,h_2 s.t. fh_1 + gh_2 = 1
[16:33:56] <tempate99> But what is the definition of k(X)[Y] ?
[16:34:13] *** Joins: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim)
[16:34:16] <rubiksdream> k(X) is the field of rational functions in X, over k
[16:34:33] <rubiksdream> so {p(X)/q(X) : q \in k[X], q != 0 }
[16:34:51] <tempate99> oh, alright
[16:35:11] <rubiksdream> actually k(X)[Y] is more than a PID, its a euclidean domain, so you can do euclids algorithm in it
[16:35:20] <tempate99> so k[X] C k(X) ?

[16:35:49] <rubiksdream> and so k[X][Y] \subset k(X)[Y]

[16:46:49] <brownorange> @joel135 I was in the midst of making an 8bit computer today when I realized the best instruction set is already provided in the expressions the logical language supports. Building a compact and usable memory space, that's the real challenge.
[16:47:45] <rubiksdream> tempate99 because clearing denominators involves multiplying by a polynomial in X
[16:48:29] <rubiksdream> if [a_0(X)/b_0(X)] + ... + [a_d(X)/b_d(X)]Y^d is the polynomial in K(X)[Y] we want to 'clear denominators
[16:48:48] <rubiksdream> then we multiply by some multiple of lcm(b_0(X),...,b_d(X))
[16:48:56] <rubiksdream> e.g. b_0(X)...b_d(X)
[16:49:04] <rubiksdream> so that we get a polynomial in k[X][Y]
[16:49:57] <tempate99> Alright, I think I get it

[16:51:42] <tempate99> I'm one page away from tackling Nullstellenstaz
[16:52:24] <z0k> I know that N(tau sigma) = 1 + N(sigma) where tau is a neighbouring transposition to some sigma in S_n.

[18:55:48] <Filystyn> ok find derivative function of y = ln ( ln ( ln x ) ) , my answer is dy/dx = 1/( ln ( ln x ) * ln( x ) * x ) . Book answer is 1/( ( 1 - x ) * x^(1/2) )
[18:56:33] <hanif> of course, the cases when length(q)<length(p), and when p occurs in q are trivial. but what if p doesn't occur in q?

[18:57:05] <nejimban> Filystyn: obviously your answer is correct
[18:57:27] <nejimban> book's one is not
[18:57:43] <hanif> Filystyn: i normally use https://www.derivative-calculator.net/ to check
[18:58:02] <nejimban> did you check it is indeed referring to the derivative of ln(ln(ln(x)))
[18:58:38] <hanif> the book could also have typoed the question
[19:01:28] <nejimban> yeah it likely wrote ln(ln(ln(x))) instead of ln((1+√x)/(1-√x))
[19:03:36] <diophantoz> books never typo in my case
[19:03:42] <diophantoz> i've learned that the hard way

[19:11:11] <HisShadow> yes
[19:12:05] <bildramer> I'm imagining r having p somewhere in the middle which allows it to act like a program "inputting" new information from both sides, but is that actually feasible? you would have to find some clever encoding that always maintains a p in the middle to be replaced
[19:12:20] <HisShadow> although some integrators were nuts, like when integrating sin(x^2) it gave some long fraction with erf functions instead of just spitting a fresnel sin function

[22:17:29] <motle> was "ratio" the answer you were after?
[22:17:50] <Nyeogmi> oh uh i think sometimes one gear turns more times than another gear over the same timespan?
[22:18:30] <motle> yeah, thats the ratio of interest i think
[22:18:35] <Nyeogmi> i don't know how that works though! i think the number of teeth turned on each gear will be the same, for two connected gears?
[22:19:00] <Nyeogmi> so like, if i have a gear with 6 teeth and a gear with 36 teeth, and i turn the gear with six teeth all the way, i think the gear with thirty six teeth will only turn 1/6 of the way! but i don't know for sure
[22:19:15] <motle> right, but they have different radius, or #of teeth or however its measured
[22:19:29] <quarterback> Nyeogmi, That seems to be the way gears work
[22:19:53] <motle> Nyeogmi: yes, for sure
[22:20:30] <Nyeogmi> oh yeah!!! so i think the number of teeth probably depends on the radius? or maybe i'm crazy and misinformed!
[22:21:01] <quarterback> The number of teeth and radius of gears vary I think
[22:21:06] <Nyeogmi> like i think that if i have six inches of circumference and each tooth is point five inches, i have twelve teeth?
[22:21:23] <Nyeogmi> i think you can connect a gear with 12 teeth to a gear of the same radius with 24 teeth though
[22:21:58] *** crankslider is now known as slidercrank
[22:22:35] <motle> i guess for the teeth to lock together they have to be the same size...
[22:24:49] <Nyeogmi> yeah! i mean i think you can connect two gears of differently-sized teeth by welding them at the same center point? i hope so at least!
