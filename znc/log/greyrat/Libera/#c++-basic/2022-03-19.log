I have been trying to find out if it's possible, but can I give the address of the object calling this class to 'first_node', or is there no way to do that? I want to make a point of reference that I can use as the first node when needed later.
[00:31:53] <cbreak> FuzzyBottom: you shouldn't use raw pointers like this
[00:32:07] <cbreak> you need a constructor / destructor if you want to implement ownership yourself

[01:39:17] <Alipha> FuzzyBottom: well, I was confused by your design last time you posted about this, but I didn't go into detail, unfortunately. But, so, why does Coordinator have parent, current_node, and first_node? I'm assuming Coordinator is supposed to be managing the tree. So doesn't it only need "root"?
[01:40:23] <Alipha> And why does Node have "child" when it already has "children"?
[01:41:10] <Alipha> And shared_ptr can probably just be unique_ptr, but that's not really important right now
[01:41:42] <Alipha> And runnable can be a unique_ptr
[01:42:52] *** Joins: Tazy (~Tazmainia@2001:1c02:1701:6a00::1003)
[01:43:10] <Alipha> And if Coordinator is managing a tree, how does add_child work? Add child to which node?
[01:43:46] <Alipha> I didn't go into detail before because I had so many questions and didn't know where to start, heh
[01:43:51] <FuzzyBottom> Alipha: In my head so I am probably wrong :)... parent was the initial node created at initialization. current_node was to help me keep track of which node was going to be having the parent and then child node point to the new node being created. first_node is what I thought I needed to be able to have an object I would be able to point to, if I needed to start iterating over the tree etc
[01:44:59] <FuzzyBottom> Alipha: I am sorry about this. I understand my problem I am dealing with is not an easy one to sort out online. The internship I am working on wants this, and the person who I get help from has never made a tree :)
[01:45:26] <Alipha> That... sounds like a recipe for disaster
[01:45:37] <FuzzyBottom> If it's too much, do not feel like you need to help. I am currently reading a book on data structures in order to HOPEFULLY give me more knowledge :)
[01:45:50] <FuzzyBottom> The code or my internship? :)
[01:46:12] <Alipha> That the person helping you make a tree has never made a tree
[01:46:22] <Alipha> What is this tree for?
[01:47:16] *** Quits: teut (~teut@122.161.89.92) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:48:08] <FuzzyBottom> I will be passed a string. It will contain either a suite of tests, or just the name of a test. I need to break the string down into a vector, and each element becomes a new node, of the 'children' node prior. So first.second.third, first has children (second), and second has children (third).
[01:49:27] <FuzzyBottom> If first is sent only, run all suites inside of it, so each children element could say hold five suites. Then inside those suites, each suite has a group of tests, and each test will be an element in that 'children' vector
[01:49:48] <FuzzyBottom> Someone suggested a list instead. Thoughts?

[01:56:31] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[01:56:33] <Alipha> Well, I think all my suggestions (which were worded as questions) are still valid. I'm not sure if add_child or register_test really needs an element parameter. Isn't the caller just going to always want to append the test?
[01:57:55] <FuzzyBottom> Alipha: I am so sorry, I missed that set of questions. Give me a minute.
[01:59:35] <FuzzyBottom> I can paste my code. It is embarrassing :) I will actually post all that I have on an online ide, so it might make it easier to see what's what. Let me make sure it runs :)
[01:59:51] <Alipha> That you should get rid of parent, first_node and current_node, and replace them with a pointer named "root". (or call it "parent", but "root" is more standard).
[02:00:47] <Alipha> That Node's child member seems pointless. That shared_ptr should be replaced with unique_ptr. That runnable should be a unique_ptr.
[02:03:05] <FuzzyBottom> I feel a LOT more studying into trees would be better than wasting your time. I will implement what you gave me to change, and see how it goes.
[02:03:22] <FuzzyBottom> What you read online, and then what you implement is very different
[02:04:44] <FuzzyBottom> as for the runnable, it was you that suggested T*. Perhaps that was when it made more sense to have it that way before I messed with the rest of the code.
[02:04:59] <FuzzyBottom> Thank you again for your help.
[02:09:42] <FuzzyBottom> Alipha: Here is what I have. You can probably see how confused I was making this :) https://onlinegdb.com/fjaov8neG
[02:19:48] <FuzzyBottom> Oh, and as for why I have/had child and children, that was because I could not figure out how to work down the tree via the vector of children, in order to add to the nested children vector of children. That was the best I could come up with :)

[03:34:55] <FuzzyBottom> One question that I think is the most difficult for me to understand is, inside my Node class, each node has a vector of nodes. Each level in the tree is a node with a vector of nodes etc. What would be the best way to implement a way to traverse the nodes in order to add a new node to the vector when it's at the right level? Someone suggested a function in the node that loops through the vector.
[03:35:37] <FuzzyBottom> This may be a 'too hard to answer online' question, but if it is, just let me know that please
