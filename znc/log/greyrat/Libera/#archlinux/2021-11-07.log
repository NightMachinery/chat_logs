[00:08:23] <mikebutash> with a host agent they watch your traffic, recommend a profile for what to allow or restrict, and then push a firewall policy to your system whether windoze, mac, or linux
[00:08:47] <randomxusr> mikebutash, what your view of home routers? I've been uusing Arch as my home pc. Do you have suggestions?  I was consideringa a Firewalla or a Netgate 1100 and PiHole, but should probably still address the local system
[00:08:58] <mikebutash> you have to reproduce that same thing, identify what you want in/out, and build policy around that

[15:19:57] <Nselm> The Unix programming environment? Its a little old but still quite interesting, especially if you want to know some of the why
[15:20:24] <evilop> as for unix permissions: because ram was expensive
[15:20:31] <evilop> ram/storage
[15:21:37] <Nuc1eoN> The reason is that recently a I made a pr in a project (of a windows guy) and I changed his main script to be executable by default. And he was like "I hope no linux security expert complains about this". And I thought like... No?? But then I couldnt explain to him why we would even need those permissions lmao
[15:22:22] <evilop> if unix was created today we would (hopefully) have a full acl system from the start
[15:22:40] <Nuc1eoN> evilop: seriously? So your saying it has nothing to do with security today?

[15:26:40] <Nselm> Now my totally uninformed opinion: To my knowledge, Unix was a time-sharing system(?), that is multiple users would often use the same computer. This means that you dont want Alice  to be able to overwrite Bobs files at a whim. So it was more to protect the users from each other than to keep people out I think, especially since at that time, I
[15:26:41] <Nselm> dont think anybody bothered about Computer security. Please correct me if I am wrong.
[15:26:56] <earnestly> It still used DAC for file access.  They still very much believed in the idea of usable security being better than unusable but great security
[15:27:15] *** Joins: maord (~maord@IGLD-83-130-29-247.inter.net.il)
[15:27:41] <earnestly> factotum is a better approach than complicated rbac/mac style systems which require a lot of intervention to use
[15:28:33] <earnestly> And as most things are regulated via 9p, you could attach authfds to control access over it
[15:29:55] <earnestly> factotum stored the keys, services only had to query it for access on the user's behalf and so those services never saw the user's key and never had to store them in its own memory/address space
[15:30:16] <evilop> as for the implementation details, it makes for a really small struct

[19:11:04] <carbolymer> since I've pasted a link to my PKGBUILD... I have pkgver() which returns package version from git commit hash - so in AUR is shown the version which I've pushed. How can I upgrade package on my machines? should I rebuild it every time I do system upgrade, as well as other *-git packages?

[22:43:19] <mikebutash> like using a manjaro installer?
[22:43:20] <Namarrgon> juliademille: boot the distro you want to install arch from, download the bootstrap tarball and chroot into it
[22:43:48] <Gagis> I assume he means like booting a live ubuntu or something and chrooting for arch installation from there?
[22:43:49] <juliademille> like, i want to do the install from terminal as normal, just in a GUI environment so i don't need to have my laptop on my cramped desk
