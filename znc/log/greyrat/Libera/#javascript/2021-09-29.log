[02:02:04] <asd> ljharb: so it makes the class available for external files to access the class?

[02:02:52] <ljharb> asd: it makes a value available, yes, whether it's a class or not
[02:03:04] <ljharb> asd: no, nothing's overwritten. you can only export one thing per file
[02:03:19] <ljharb> asd: that thing can also be "an object of other stuff" but it's a best practice to only export one thing per file
[02:03:45] <asd> in my local file, that contains `module.exports=class foo{}` should i use it as `new foo()` or `new module.exports.foo()` ?
[02:04:03] <ljharb> asd: why would you define it and instantiate it in the same file?
[02:04:44] <asd> ljharb: too lazy to create a secondary file to test out the functions. i'd rather temporarily have a testing file in the same window as i write the class (and i will delete the "test" code when its finished)
[02:06:11] <asd> also are you saying `class Foo{...}` is a definition? i figured it was a declaration and `new Foo()` creates a instance of the class
[02:06:37] <asd> nvm ignore the last question
[02:06:38] <ljharb> asd: um, tests have to be in a separate file because you don't want to run them in production
[02:06:49] <ljharb> asd: you're correct, `new Foo()` makes an instance

[21:44:28] <sheetjs> 2018 to be specific https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/demos/angular2/ionic.ts
[21:44:29] <devslash> oh . I built my first app and added Android as a dependency but am having issues building it. I think the problem is on the ionic side
[21:44:58] <sheetjs> did you add the platform?

[21:45:30] <devslash> and it created the android project
[21:45:35] <sheetjs> is `cap` short for cordova platform?
[21:45:59] <sheetjs> maybe that's the new thing.  this old shell script runs `ionic cordova platform add ios`
[21:46:29] <devslash> it stands for capacitor which is the cross platform runtime engine
[21:46:39] <devslash> I think it still uses cordova somehow
[21:46:54] <devslash> because you have to install a package called cordova-res to use it
[21:47:09] <sheetjs> can you try running `ionic cordova platform add android`
[21:47:40] <devslash> thats not the right command according to ionic at https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app/6-deploying-mobile
[21:49:06] <devslash> it looks like they switch to using capacitor at some point

[23:37:49] <Alexendoo> That is a paper containing many equations, you'll have to narrow it down
[23:38:03] *** Joins: tofran (~tofran@37.189.158.134)
[23:38:24] <teut> and there was a react extension to check website performance
[23:38:34] <teut> can someone tell that?
[23:38:39] <no_gravity> Alexendoo: The paper is about a formula.

[23:39:52] <no_gravity> You don't need to read it. The formula stands out very visibly.
[23:39:57] <teut> sorry bad network
[23:40:01] <stenno> no_gravity: you can write it like that
[23:40:18] <Alexendoo> Well good luck with that then no_gravity
[23:40:37] <no_gravity> Alexendoo: ctrl-f and "equation". The next chars after "equation" are the equation.
[23:40:50] <sheetjs> no_gravity: all parts are implemented in JS
[23:41:06] <sheetjs> arcsin is Math.asin, square root is Math.sqrt, and sin is Math.sin
[23:41:10] <no_gravity> stenno: Like what? I cannot even copy/paste it as it is written in funky math notation.
[23:41:17] <sheetjs> it would literally be
[23:41:24] <stenno> f(alpha,x) => Math.sin(2**(x*r) * Math.asin(Math.sqrt(alpha)))
[23:41:46] <stenno> const f = (alpha,x) => Math.sin(2**(x*r) * Math.asin(Math.sqrt(alpha))) ** 2
[23:41:48] <no_gravity> stenno: Yay! Thank you!
[23:43:45] <stenno> not sure what value 'r' should have here though
[23:43:50] <stenno> but thats for you to find out :P
[23:44:04] <sheetjs> tau is an integer constant
[23:44:15] <sheetjs> "constant which effectively controls the desired level of accuracy"
[23:44:29] <stenno> oh its a tau, not an r
