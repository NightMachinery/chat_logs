[09:14:45] <somiaj> there is already a firmare image built, and you could use a preseed to just select other packages to isntall at boot if you wanted.
[09:16:23] <nickgaw> true but will it let me answer other questions if all I want the installation to do is install the extra packages but let me do the rest of the installation as I normally would?
[09:17:00] <somiaj> I haven't used preseed. Personally I would just install the packages I needed after the isntall, there are various ways to clone a whole set of packages
[09:19:07] <nickgaw> So you are just saying do the installation as normal then install everything I want manually are there any good full system backup options for debian that will work on encrypted LVM setups where I can fully make an image of the system and store it somewhere should something ever break I can go back to that image and fully restore the system as it is my own system so no other users to worry about?

[09:32:25] <somiaj> !debian clone
[09:32:25] <dpkg> One method of cloning Debian installs is to take a current Debian machine that is set up with the packages you want and run the command "dpkg --get-selections > ~/selectionfile".  Then, after the base install on other machines use that file and do: "dpkg --set-selections < ~/selectionfile && apt-get dselect-upgrade".  Also ask me about <aptitude clone>, <reinstall>, <things to backup> <apt-clone>.
[09:32:27] <somiaj> !aptitude clone
[09:32:31] <somiaj> !aptitude clone
[09:32:31] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.
[09:32:48] <somiaj> there are vaiours ways to clone package lists, so isnteaad of imaging the whoel thing, ocne the isntall is done, just install a cloned package list
[09:34:22] <nickgaw> Why not clone the entire system so everything can be restored just as it was before the issue?
[09:34:39] <somiaj> It really depends on the goal, this method is more portable
[09:35:15] <somiaj> I personally prefer to just install the packages as I need them, and make backups of $HOME and maybe /etc or /var depending on what the machine is used for
[09:35:40] <somiaj> Though I only manage a few systems, so I don't gain much efficency by using images.
[09:36:22] <somiaj> the other issue with making an image of a file system, lvm, or even encrypted luks, is they are dependent on the hardware they are on, so different sized harddrives and such cause extra steps to extend/shrink the image
[09:36:43] <somiaj> though as metioned, a lot depends on goal, here I thought you were wanting to do installs, not backup/recover a system.
[09:37:28] <nickgaw> true I am going to use this image or backup only for this one system which is why I am interested in making an image of this system.
[09:39:57] <somiaj> make sure you test your images, as recovery is part of backup

[13:14:16] <ocb> once i do 'service networking stop' and 'start' again, connection works for ~30 seconds until the 169.x ip route and address are added to ens3 interface

[13:57:17] <ocb> :-)
[13:58:42] <jelly> NetworkManager on Debian knows better than to touch devices configured in /e/n/interfaces.  connman apparently doesn't have that kind of exception.
[13:59:50] <jelly> so we have 5+ ways to configure network, ifupdown, NetworkManager, systemd-networkd, connman... I wonder

[19:32:02] <festerdam> sney: Where do I change the kernel params? I did not update recently. Some user application massively slowed down the system and I managed to get to a tty and see it was eating all the RAM. After I sigkilled it, I tried switching to my X session, but it didn't respond. I pressed the power button once and it seemed to do a normal poweroff. After that, it didn't start up anymore. I tested other systems on
[19:32:08] <festerdam> the same device after that and they seem to be doing fine (so it probably isn't a hardware related problem, which could have been the case since my device has the tendency to overheat if I'm not careful).

[23:08:17] <dadinn> I am trying to connect to a server using serial a D9-USB cable: https://imgur.com/a/PCOT3Qa
[23:09:39] <dadinn> I am trying to use tio, but when I connect to ttyUSB0 I would expect to see it say "Connected", which doesn't happen
[23:11:00] <dadinn> I've tried to change /etc/default/grub to add console=ttyS0 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and then update-grub and reboot... still nothing :/
