[01:04:21] <puff> I'm having some eye problems as prat of which my doctor gave me some drops that dilate the pupils. Needless to say, this makes everything look bright.  In the case of my monitor, painfully so.  When I adjust the screen brightness using the Ubuntu controls, it works on the laptop screen but on the external monitor.

[01:24:34] <BCMM> puff: there's a ddcci-dkms package that includes an out-of-tree driver for those monitors. it doesn't automatically load, so you'll need to add ddcci-backlight to /etc/modules or something as well as installing the package.

[01:25:29] <hexnewbie> BCMM: I'm so installing that on my other box
[01:25:32] <BCMM> once you've done that, any monitors that support ddc/ci brightness control should show up in /sys/class/backlight just like the laptop's built in one, and brightness applets should treat it the same
[01:25:38] <tm512> also ugh, seems like the xr_glx_hybrid backend for picom doesn't actually seem to solve this flickering issue I was having, but the other suggestion I've seen to avoid screen tearing is to enable "force composition pipeline" in the nvidia driver, which severely hampers framerate in a way that picom doesn't

[05:52:20] *** Joins: xlxlx (~xlxlx@2601:583:300:7090:b823:e61a:b7:5ea9)
[05:52:47] <rascul> that would require sourcing the script
[05:53:04] <sathylias> rascul: Yeah, that's it. But as soon as the script exits, you're back in the original directory.
[05:53:09] <rascul> yes
[05:53:41] <sathylias> rascul: Some users are probably use that script, it would be nice if they didn't have to source it but run the script directly..
[05:53:42] *** Quits: Elodin (~weechat@user/elodin) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:53:46] <rascul> but what you could do is create a wrapper function which just sources the script, have that wrapper function loaded into your environment, and you can call functions like regular commands
[05:53:50] <Dagmar> That's because when you run a shell script, it launches the shell script as a _child process_

But upon a couple of days ago without touching configurations, pulse audio seems to no longer reconize it as headphones, but instead only the microphone that it has. All my other audio output devices (line out) is working just fine. What could be the reason for this? I tried different usb ports as well
[05:54:53] <Dagmar> That will _replace_ the current process with the shell script you're trying to run, but that might cause you other issues

[06:51:45] <tirnanog> you can either run rsyncd on the remote end or sshd on the remote end (with rsync also available there). both approaches will reduce the overhead of recursing directories and stat'ing entries, at least. don't use 2.6.9 if you can help it.

[08:12:41] <mlu> ayecee: have you checked out the remake?
[08:12:52] <tirnanog> madprops: the kernel doesn't care that your file ends in ".sh" any more than it cares whether an ELF file ends in ".elf". something things should be executable and some should not be (and might even constitute a danger). that is why we have an execute bit.
[08:13:04] <ayecee> nope, but to be fair, i only spent like 15 minutes on the original
[08:13:08] <tirnanog> some things*
[08:13:38] <madprops> tirnanog, i get that, but what would be the danger of making files executable by default?

[08:14:44] <tirnanog> madprops: it would be staggeringly dangerous. you're then talking about being able to execute any file, without exception, with the kernel trying to treat it as some identifiable binary format and dispatching it accordingly.
[08:15:04] <mlu> ayecee: realMyst is a high quality remake
[08:15:08] <znf> Windows handles this by with using file extensions -- any .exe (and whatever else) is going to be executable

[08:50:32] <Gustavo6046> znf, because LSD is not only in English speaking nations
[08:50:36] <labrador> LSD is a pretty famous drug
[08:50:46] <znf> in Romanian it's "Dietilamida acidului lisergic", so that would be DAL
[08:50:54] <Gustavo6046> and people who use them tend to use the slangs from the people who invented it, like those weirdos we like to call Americans just because they're in these two continents instead of Britain

[12:20:38] <lockywolf> Unrelated question. Is it possible to tweak x264 to make it less CPU-intensive?
[12:20:49] <lockywolf> At the expense of bandwidth, perhaps.
[12:22:56] <lockywolf> I managed to make Raspberry Pi 4b decode x264 with hardware acceleration, and for 1080p, framedrop is ~15%

[12:24:46] <hexnewbie> You get some more motion-intensive scene and that ~15% framdrop will become a major slowdown, and 70% framedrop. Like, I'm not sure that framedropping helps when decoding, since in most cases you need to decode the previous frame to get the next one, it's mostly for slow output drivers
[12:25:05] <hexnewbie> I could be wrong, and it would definitely help right before a key frame

[12:26:12] <hexnewbie> But *if* the decoding *i*s a problem, only 15% leeway will result in catastrophic performance drop for scenes that are more expensive to decode.

[12:28:00] <hexnewbie> lockywolf: I'm saying that it *might* be. It should be easy enough to check by looking at CPU usage
[12:28:18] <hexnewbie> Er, hardwarwe acceeleration? That won't show in CPU usage, err, my bad
[12:28:24] <lockywolf> with hardware decoding, cpu usage is not very high
[12:28:31] <lockywolf> ~20% per core
[12:28:51] <lockywolf> but that might not be the best indicator
[12:29:01] <hexnewbie> I have no idea how to check, then
[12:29:05] <lockywolf> because the GPU might as well be overloaded

[23:37:06] <tm512> trying to help walk a friend through a convenient way to update his home server, he's gonna be reinstalling to a fresh disk, so I suggested creating a VM, attaching the fresh disk to that, and do the full installation in the VM. he's read things that apparently sometimes Linux won't boot after being swapped into a real system due to driver issues, though
[23:37:07] <jim> thanks
[23:37:26] <tm512> I'm used to Linux basically autodetecting everything and having zero issue being swapped between systems though

[23:49:51] <tm512> we looked around online for how to update the certs but it seems like since 16.04 got EOL'd before the CA certs expired, couldn't find any way that didn't also fail
