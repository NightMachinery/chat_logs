All the information I could found online points to modifying grub.cfg to provide command line options to kernel. but for some reason I could not get it working. after the boot it lands in live session desktop instead of starting the install. any ideas?

[20:20:32] <node1> Hi, it looks Ubuntu is unable to shutdown completely. I'm using focal stable version, with AMD architecture one. What could be the root cause?
[20:21:03] <jhutchins> XATRIX: Are you providing hosting services to non-technical users?
[20:21:53] <jhutchins> node1: The most common cause is either a shared network mount that is not un-mounted before the networking system is taken down, or some piece of hardware that does not acknowledge the shutdown.
[20:23:08] <node1> How to identify those hardware ?
[20:23:41] *** Joins: thelounge9575 (c0a066a4@67.205.143.82)
[20:24:21] <node1> It looks either the problem is with the Ubuntu OS, or some malacious code. But before coming to any conclusion. I would like to confirm from you people.
[20:24:37] <node1> Is that i'm not the only one who facing this issue.
[20:25:54] <node1> I don't have any shared network mount, but yes in bios ethernet cable port is enabled.

[20:36:32] <jhutchins> XATRIX: In that case a web-based administration system is a really bad idea.  They are written with the assumption that a competent, console-based administrator will be behind them to fix the problems that WILL be caused by them.

[21:13:30] <jhutchins> node1: Not that it's anything useful, but one of the things you learn by trying different operating sysgtems is that sometimes hardware problems exist and some systems don't reveal them, Either they know about them and they work around the problem, or they just ignore it.
[21:14:00] <jhutchins> node1: If it's _not_ a hung mount, the most frequent solution is to try a different kernel.

[22:02:52] <Maik> kur1j: that is the hwe kernel and it's correct

[22:03:40] <kur1j> we are having really weird problems where our GPUs are failing
[22:03:55] <kur1j> I attributed it to kernel versions
[22:04:03] <leftyfb> kur1j: then reboot into the previous kernel
[22:04:12] <kur1j> still broken
[22:04:27] <leftyfb> then it's not an issue with the latest kernel
[22:04:33] <kur1j> im trying to troubleshoot but this machine is remote so I'm having to walk someone through it...slowly
[22:04:33] <Maik> nVidia?
[22:04:37] <kur1j> yeah NVidia
[22:04:49] <Maik> then it's probably a driver issue
[22:04:52] <kur1j> like we refreshed this machine, install all the drivers on it its working
[22:05:07] <kur1j> next day, they messaged me and said it doesn't work

[23:01:23] <kur1j> jhutchins: I'm not disagreeing it works. we have 50+ machines on various versions of ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04. The problems seem to crop up when things "get updated" kernel updates, driver updates, etc. Like the kernel goes from 5.11 to 5.13 automatically, reboot, nvidia driver breaks...even though we used the native "ubuntu-drivers autoinstall" command to install the drivers
[23:02:11] <kur1j> running random apt-get purge nvidia-* and reinstalling with various methods somehow works
[23:03:04] <jhutchins> kur1j: I use an installation that uses dkms to manage the actuall driver in-use, and a packaged wrapper that sees to updating it when the kernel gets updated.
[23:03:05] *** Joins: polve (~polve@user/polve)
[23:03:26] <kur1j> specifically what?
[23:03:26] <jhutchins> Having to deal with third-party drivers when there's a kernel update is as old as managed packages on Linux.

[23:05:07] <kur1j> well "ubuntu-drivers autoinstall" is supposed to be the native ubuntu managed nvidia driver install path
[23:05:08] <jhutchins> Still, it seems like getting a handle on what steps are actually required and how to trigger them is the trick.

[23:10:38] <jchittum> I believe part of it may be a mismatch between the tools and the driver. So the driver may install 470, but the tools don't get upgrade  (or vice versa). You can check that you have both the 470 driver and nvidia-utils-470-server

[23:13:41] <kur1j> what is the recommended fool proof way
[23:13:44] <jchittum> I don't have a public bug
[23:13:46] <kur1j> of installing it
[23:14:06] <jchittum> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaDriversInstallation is the stated "public" way
[23:14:54] <jchittum> which is what you're doing. it could be an issue with making sure to specify `--gpgpu` or setting a specific driver version rather than `autoinstall
[23:15:56] <kur1j> well thats whats crazy is it "works" but then like if the kernel gets updated something breaks
[23:16:27] <kur1j> the best way I have figured out how to get it back working is purging all of nvidia and running those steps again..._sometimes_ it works sometimes it doesnt...
