[08:50:50] <pystardust> morning!
[10:43:51] <gtlsgamr> Morning!
[10:43:53] <gtlsgamr> What is up!
[11:02:55] <iamak[m]> <gtlsgamr> "I am now using ani-cli regularly" <- It works again?
[11:03:11] <iamak[m]> It had stopped working 3-4 months back
[11:17:42] <gtlsgamr> Yes it works now
[11:23:08] <iamak[m]> Thanks
[12:34:45] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: dude ther is this framework called python toga to make cross platform apps in pure python
[12:37:43] <gtlsgamr> Is it buggy
[13:00:58] <Arya[m]> dont tkinter and pyqt5 do it aldready
[13:26:13] <gtlsgamr> Yes they do I think
[19:23:43] <pystardust> oh, this one was multiplatform, pyqt5 sounds like qt engine. I maybe wrong
[19:52:56] <Arya[m]> it is qt bindings for python
[19:53:35] <Arya[m]> but qt is cross platform and uses native widgets to an extent 
[19:53:43] <Arya[m]> its prob not as native as toga tho
[19:54:11] <Arya[m]> considering its an alternative to gtk and .net and not a kind of frontend to them 
[20:05:43] <gtlsgamr> guys i am going full light theme

[20:13:07] <gtlsgamr> The one from win95
[20:13:19] <gtlsgamr> Windows 95 interface used that font
[20:13:23] <gtlsgamr> that is why I am using it

[20:14:13] <gtlsgamr> nostalgic and shit
[20:14:23] <gtlsgamr> And i was tired of dark theme and mainstream design standards
