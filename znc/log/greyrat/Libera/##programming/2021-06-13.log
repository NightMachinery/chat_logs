[00:45:17] <Akuli> difficult naming question :D
[00:45:25] <Akuli> i have a function that takes a class as argument, instantiates it when a tab is added, and calls methods on it when items are clicked in menubar, what should i call it?
[00:45:38] <Akuli> instantiate_on_new_tab_and_call_methods() ?

[00:46:32] <GeDaMo> Sounds like a wrapper

[00:50:01] <GeDaMo> tab_manager?
[00:50:10] <Akuli> i already have a concept of a tab manager
[00:50:19] <Akuli> this function combines the tab manager and the menubar together into a convenience thing
[00:50:19] <GeDaMo> tab_controller
[00:50:23] <W> so it's something that initializes the plugin ui?
[00:50:43] <Akuli> it puts items to the menubar so that you can click them to run the methods
[00:51:02] <W> it initializes the plugin ui
[00:51:17] <Akuli> i guess you could say so, but it could be misleading
[00:51:28] <Akuli> not all plugins need exactly this combination of menubar and tab-specific instantiating
[00:51:58] <Akuli> instantiate_for_tab_and_add_to_menubar() ?

[00:53:39] <Akuli> hmm
[00:53:53] <Akuli> now that i think about it, maybe i shouldn't automagically instantiate it on new tab
[00:54:19] <spynxic> Is the actor model critical to using oop?
[00:54:23] <Akuli> but the menubar needs to choose the instance of the correct tab... hmm
[00:55:05] <pulse> you know, naming problems often times retroactively point to a flawed architecture
[00:55:12] <pulse> not saying that's necessarily the case but worth looking into it
[00:55:25] <Akuli> yeah, i was thinking of whether i could do this differently
[00:55:36] <pulse> you should be reducing logical units of your code into things that are simple to name
[00:55:39] <pulse> ideally anyway
[00:55:42] <Akuli> the architecture problem is that it ties together two otherwise unrelated components, tab manager and menubar
[00:55:44] <pulse> i know in the real world it's sometimes not easy
[00:55:56] <pulse> but if you find yourself trying to name something that does 7 things at once, maybe just maybe it's not the best way to do it
[00:56:00] <Akuli> right
[00:56:28] <Akuli> so i'm thinking of splitting this problem into two parts
[01:00:37] <Akuli> i think i figured out a way to do this :)
[01:00:57] <Akuli> menubar forwards the click event to the tab (knowing which tabs can accept it)
[01:01:44] <Akuli> when a new tab is created, an instance is created and the events are bound to its methods

[04:58:41] <dkeohane> odd question, does anyone have a synopsis of RFC2616 that runs through the minimum requirements for compliance?
[05:02:09] *** Quits: gilesc (~textual@cpe-172-112-18-165.socal.res.rr.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[05:03:14] <amigojapan> dkeohane: I know what it is but not sure I can compose an intelligible synopsis
[05:04:55] <dkeohane> amigojapan: i'll probably just give in and skim through the rfc
[05:06:57] <amigojapan> dkeohane: it is a protocol which uses a series of messages to negotiate a response from a server to a client
[05:07:31] <amigojapan> Not sure if that constitutes a synopsis
[05:08:50] <dkeohane> yes.. i'm aware of what HTTP1.1 is, thank you though. i'm wondering about the bare minimum an http1.1 server must implement to be 2616 compliant
[05:09:56] <amigojapan> I see, I think they need to implement the full RFC

[05:12:07] <dkeohane> arahael: always open for reducing responsibilities.. unfortunately this is a pet project. i'd like to not get too deeply involved, but i'd also like to brand the final product "RFC2616 compliant"
[05:12:52] <arahael> dkeohane: Next best might be to find an automated test for it.
[05:13:03] <arahael> Unfortunately I think most tests for that will be testing for performance.
[05:14:32] <arahael> Exhausting all that, I'd probably buckle down and write a test for each point in the RFC.
[05:14:50] <arahael> Another point in favour of doing TDD. ;)

[05:31:02] <chester> and that in c as well, I guess.
[05:31:04] <arahael> Seriously though, writing http wouldn't be that hard, indeed, so a fun project.  The trouble is indeed, being able to claim it's a complete minimal implementation.
[05:31:56] <chester> it isn't hard. You can even do it super-easy for yourself by just responding with the same correct http response regardless of what the request was

[13:00:11] <W> it's not clear which meaning of "module" and "report" you mean, to be honest, there's missing context
[13:00:43] <W> e.g. the typical "report" (in the sense of documentation) of a Java "module" is HTML generated by javadoc :)
[13:00:45] <spinningCat> okay like you have software and fe3atures right

[13:04:37] <spinningCat> i bet it is word

[13:52:58] <nitrix> AndroidDAW, You have to keep the view matrix separate from the rotation/translation/scale. When one of those changes, you can recalculate a brand new matrix. The reason being that matrix transformations are cumulative.
[13:52:58] <AndroidDAW> i would obtain a final _projection by the following    _projection = tX * tY * tZ * rX * rY * rZ * _perspective * tX * tY * tZ    ?
[13:53:30] <nitrix> AndroidDAW, Also, what you're discussing in a _view_ matrix, not a _projection_ matrix. A projection wouldn't have a rotation/translation.
[13:53:41] <mrig> euouae: let the prof chose their students and that will be so :D
[13:53:55] <mrig> that will never happen rather.
[13:53:59] <pikapika> nitrix, another thign to note is that

[13:55:44] <nitrix> AndroidDAW, Projection normally is made of near & far planes, a field of view angle and and aspect ratio (typically the viewport's). 
[13:56:04] <AndroidDAW> so       view = translateX * translateY * translateZ * rotX * rotY * rotZ * perspective * translateX * translateY * translateZ    ?

[14:06:48] <nitrix> Presumably it's in model space, which is also why euler is so problematic. Once you rotate around X by 90 degrees, your other two axis have changed positions.
[14:07:10] <pikapika> Exactly bro

[14:16:59] <pikapika> mrig, someone else was talking about rotations in 3d
[14:17:03] <alycidyne> mrig: pikapika was talking to AndroidDAW 
[14:17:04] <arahael> dan01: That makes sense, because you defined an inner scope and define a variable inside that scope.
[14:17:04] <mrig> oh I see.
[14:17:27] <mrig> In that case, what are you coding AndroidDAW?
[14:17:56] <dan01> arahael: thing is I want to put a function call inside try block and that function returns something say X. Now I want to use that X but I have to put all that code also inside the try block
[14:18:04] <pikapika> alycidyne, you just get one subset of rotations by only rotating wrt a given axis

[14:19:42] <pikapika> alycidyne, which means you are doing something like a rotate along latitude then along longtitude anyways
[14:19:51] <jthistle> dan01: define a variable outside the try block with no value, assign to it inside the block, and it will be available outside the block afterwards.
[14:21:15] *** federico is now known as Guest4058
[14:21:46] <jthistle> actually, you only need that if you're using `let`
[14:21:51] <AndroidDAW> im trying to code a camera system
[14:22:17] <dan01> jthistle: is it a good practice?
[14:22:48] <jthistle> dan01: if you use `var` inside the try block to define the variable it will then be available outside the block, since `var` uses function-level scoping, whereas `let` is just scoped within whatever curly braces it appears in.
[14:22:55] <mrig> AndroidDAW: Oh, a virtual camera; A view?
[14:22:55] <pikapika> Yeah var is everywhere
[14:23:01] <nitrix> Personally I find quaternions a lot simpler. The idea is that for any combination of rotations around 3 axis, you can instead represent it as a single rotation around a specific axis (that isn't X, Y, Z aligned).
[14:23:04] <pikapika> Which was really alarming and annoying in the beginning
[14:23:10] <pikapika> Thank god we have let now
[14:23:26] <pikapika> nitrix, I haven't studied the quarternion
[14:23:40] <AndroidDAW> why tf does my rotation go incorrect when i multiply the matrix by either 0.0f or 1.0f
[14:23:51] <jthistle> dan01: well, it's pretty much the only way to do it. I don't see a problem with it. It's certainly better than putting a load of code you don't want to catch errors for inside a try block.
[14:23:55] <pikapika> What
[14:24:19] <AndroidDAW> as if i omit the Z rotation all together then it only rotates the X and Y axises
[14:25:01] <AndroidDAW> but if i set the Z rotation to 0 or 1 then the Z axis gets rotated somehow
[14:25:14] <AndroidDAW> 0.0f or 1.0f *
[14:25:42] <AndroidDAW> a matrix multiplied by 1.0f should be equal to itself right?
[14:26:18] <nitrix> pikapika, X Y Z A, the X Y Z says how much close to the X, Y and Z axis you are, effectively designating a vector (an axis), then the A is how much you rotate around that.
[14:26:40] <AndroidDAW> eg Matrix4::rotationX(x) * Matrix4::rotationY(y) * Matrix4::rotationZ(1.0f); should be exactly the same as Matrix4::rotationX(x) * Matrix4::rotationY(y); right?
[14:26:52] <jthistle> AndroidDAW: 
[14:26:54] <jthistle> no
[14:27:14] <jthistle> because Matrix4::rotationz(1.0f) is a rotation matrix that rotates by 1.0 radians around the Z axis
[14:27:29] <AndroidDAW> eg 0.0f * 1.0f is 0, and >0.0f * 1.0f is >0.0f
[14:28:08] <jthistle> you're confusing it with the Diag{1,1,1,1} identity matrix.
[14:28:44] <nitrix> pikapika, If you modify X, Y or Z, the other ones have to change to compensate, since if you're getting more parallel to one axis, then you must be getting more perpendicular to the others.
[14:29:18] <nitrix> pikapika, That simple concept keeps the frame of reference intact and makes interpolating between two angles buttery smooth :)
[14:29:38] <nitrix> s/two angles/two orientations/
[14:30:25] <arahael> dan01: I expect that "let" should be preferred over the (older) var, because lexical scoping (which is what "let" uses) is clearer and less error prone.

I started thinking about some symbolic system for my paper programming too, and experimented with arrows "a ← b" meant assignment and "← b" meant return from function. Very cool to see that validated as something that is not a bad idea. Also that those conditionals are very interesting
[15:40:31] <pyzozord> Also the article about memory models was very interesting. I didn't know that structure-based memory model is actually coming from cobol. It's very interesting to think of C as mix of cobol and lisp.

[19:06:19] <pulse> alycidyne, a good enough conman can do it i'm sure

[21:13:11] <recursiveNode> dudes, or dudettes, when I run prometheus-adpater in Kubernetes on GCP, it fails on "https://10.112.0.1:443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/configmaps/extension-apiserver-authentication?timeout=10s 403 Forbidden": https://justpaste.it/55qbf
