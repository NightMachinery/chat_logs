[00:13:57] <fizzie> For the record, the right operand (the shift count) of the << / >> operators doesn't affect the type of the result. Most binary operators use a set of rules to find a common type for their two operands, and use that for the operation. The shifts are an exception: the type of the result is just the type of the left operand after integer promotions. But the promotions still apply.

[00:16:09] <ChoHag> And does C do either depending on the phase of the moon as I recall or is my memory faulty?
[00:16:37] <sham1> Arithmetic or logical depends on the implementatin
[00:16:40] <fizzie> On most implementations it depends solely on whether the left operand is signed or unsigned.

[00:46:10] <fizzie> Certainly it's evaluated.

[00:53:10] <fizzie> `char c = 1; int i = c + 1;` has one expression (`c + 1`), which can be evaluated. As part of that evaluation, integer promotions (as one component of the /usual arithmetic conversions/) call for the value of the subexpression `c` (of type `char`) to be converted to an `int`. After that, both operands of the `+` operator have the same type (`int`). The `+` operator yields an `int` that is the sum of the
[00:53:12] <fizzie> two operands, which is then used to initialize the object designated by `i`.
[00:54:11] <fizzie> If it had been `char c = 1; long i = c + 1;` it'd be exactly the same (the `+` would operate on two `int` values), but at the very end the result of evaluating `c + 1` would be converted to type `long`.
[00:55:31] <nitrix> sham1, ^ That one is where people get caught. They assume the intermediary results have the type of the final result, but they're independent. If there's a conversion, it's at the very end before the assignment.
[00:55:59] <sham1> Mmhm
[00:56:46] <sham1> Also I guess that one could have a pathological example where `char c = 1; int c + 1;` the addition expression would yield an `unsigned int` if sizeof(int) == 1 and char is unsigned. At least I think that in that case it might go through unsigned first

[01:05:05] <sham1> Yes
[01:06:51] <sham1> Well I'd think that `c` would be converted to `long` in the case of `c + 1L` since between the `char` and the `long`, the `long` has a bigger rank IIRC. And similarly to `unsigned long` in the case where `char` is unsigned

[15:23:18] <DPA> To avoid leaks, a lot has to be taken into account. Don't give or copy the information anywhere, unless absolutely necessary, and null any data no longer needed before freeing. This may still not be sufficient in some cases, and there may still be other vectors.
[15:23:18] <DPA> Recent linux kernels also have memfd_secret, to hide memory as good as possible from everyone else. Although that's probably more of a thing for DRM than for user data protection.
[15:23:48] <goodfella> ok realloc seems like a legit way to avoid memory leaks
[15:24:03] <goodfella> but here i read otherwise

[15:26:08] <goodfella> The realloc function deallocates the old object ...
[15:26:13] <DPA> Something being deallocated doesn't mean it's physically gone. In the case of realloc, it may not even have been nulled yet, and it's page could still be mapped for other stuff on it too.

[15:32:25] <bnchs> yes
[15:32:40] <bnchs> memory data leak, which means the previously stored data may contain sensitive data
[15:32:55] <goodfella> fizzie: i don't get it .. it just a memory that can be overwritten again

[15:34:20] <sham1> goodfella: yes they can, if they can recreate the address
[15:34:22] <bnchs> actually you can
[15:34:39] <goodfella> realloc overwrites the old address with the new one
[15:34:39] <bnchs> you can read env variables just by going out of bounds
[15:35:02] <bnchs> goodfella, but the data at the old address is still accessible
[15:35:15] <goodfella> or they might be in the exact same place..
[15:35:43] <fizzie> Anyway, "leaks" in the unintended information disclosure sense are an entirely different discussion from "leaks" in the classic forgot-to-free-what-was-allocated memory leak sense.

[15:37:01] <bnchs> good advice is to allocate if you really need to
[15:37:01] <fizzie> Arguably, but the former was clearly what the other answer was about.
[15:37:10] <bnchs> and use stack buffers if you want
[15:37:23] <bnchs> saves the headache of leaks and shit
[15:37:26] <nomagno> why is double free UB? Wouldn't double-freeing a pointer just result in nothing happening in most cases?
[15:37:55] <bnchs> "double-free in register" *crashes*
[15:38:21] <fizzie> nomagno: Because `free` expects there to be some internal bookkeeping related to the pointer you pass to it, and may be written to just assume that's the case rather than to try to guess if the pointer was already freed.
[15:39:04] <fizzie> For example, many malloc implementations put stuff in memory "before" the returned pointer, and that will have been written over by the first `free`.

[17:43:57] <ioxzev1z> goodfella, you cannot do pointer arithmetic on void *

[19:40:58] <fizzie> It's not a hardware restriction, it's a standard restriction.
[19:41:02] <fizzie> C11 6.2.8p4: "Every valid alignment value shall be a nonnegative integral power of two." p5: "An address that satisfies an alignment requirement also satisfies any weaker alignment requirement."

[23:49:11] <goodfella> where this hostility comes from ChoHag ?
[23:49:12] <ChoHag> caze: Ah I didn't consider that. I'd have just collected up to the newline keeping track of the last printable character's location.
[23:49:44] <ChoHag> goodfella: Too much arrogance combined with patent ignorance.
[23:50:21] <caze> goodfella: Consider the strategy of how the buffer was used in 1-17. The buffer is used to store characters that you potentially might *not* print.
[23:50:26] <ChoHag> The theory being that since there can be an unknown number of types of blanks there's no need to special-case that part of each line's collection.
[23:50:28] <caze> goodfella: THe same strategy can be used here.
[23:50:29] <goodfella> ChoHag: what was your intent with that message:

[23:54:11] <ChoHag> Removing the empty lines only requires tracking some addresses.
[23:54:16] <goodfella> and in the moment i start to work on solutions he started to hate me
[23:54:26] <ChoHag> It's the dynamic length of potential lines which potentially requires dynamic allocation.

Sees the space, and doesn't know if it needs to be printed, so saves it in the buffer. Sees another space, saves it in the buffer.

[23:55:17] <caze> '4' it just saw.

[23:57:22] <caze> goodfella: Not really, I saw that you use malloc and realloc, and stopped reading, because you completely missed the point of the exercise.
[23:57:22] <goodfella> upon '\n' i start all over
[23:57:30] <ChoHag> You can either wait until you have a line and know where it's non-blanks end or as caze suggested switch state between printing and collecting whenever a (non-)blank is encountered, either way you have to be able to collect an unknown-in-advance amount of data.
