[23:28:48] <pushcx> I waffled on that article but I figured it was more about how a person should evaluate different tools rather than like a business piece about pricing strategy or a rant from a dissatisfied customer.
[23:31:49] <edk> makes sense, i'm probably just being grumpy

[23:44:15] <edk> there are still quite a lot of lobsters posts with interesting technical discussions in the comments, i guess
[23:44:27] <edk> and it's very rare that lobsters commenters decide the solution to a problem is more eugenics
[23:44:39] <edk> so on the metrics that matter to me it's still quite unlike HN
[23:45:06] <amazigh> it is unlike HN, but there is still lot of startup scene mindset
