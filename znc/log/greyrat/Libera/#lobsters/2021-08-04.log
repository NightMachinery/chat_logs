[01:47:41] <gwozniak> I really don't like it when someone jumps to conclusions on what looks like a serious bug that may, in fact, not be a bug
[01:48:27] <bsandro> once it is shipped into production - it is a feature
[01:50:57] <mgdm> I once worked with a QA person who had a habit of coming over and whispering “can I see you for a sec? I think this is completely broken” and then I’d go over and look and it was some small CSS alignment problem or something
[01:55:29] <indigo> Oh man. One time QA filed a bug for some ancient version of Safari on iPhone at my last job

[01:57:57] <bsandro> i like stories about bugs that became legitimate usable features
[01:58:32] <bsandro> like the speeding up in "space invaders" at the end
[02:00:26] <lep> there was a bug in the type-checker/interpreter of the warcraft 3 language which allowed you to get the internal ref number of game objects which powered the modding scene for a decade or so
[02:00:48] <lep> until some security problems were discovered and we got a built-in function to do the same
[02:01:05] <lep> dunno if you can call that a feature
[02:02:12] <bsandro> at work in our game we had a bug when you interact with a key object that dissipates fog of war gradually, and you don't know what objects are that initially
[02:02:55] <bsandro> but first interaction makes surrounding fog translucent, and we have to re-render a giant texture for that and there is a tiny interruption for all animations
[02:03:07] <lep> to this day i keep compability in the syntax checker i maintain
[02:03:18] <bsandro> and players use that to find the objects of interests now :D
[02:03:55] <lep> strafe jumping is another big one to me))
[02:04:04] <lep> one of the best bugs

[19:11:19] <companion_cube> the choice is what makes the whining possible
[19:11:59] <iDrougge> I'm not sure if choice is an inherent quality of open source software.

[22:15:44] <c355e3b> I'm using them right now to process kernel events into structured logs
[22:16:12] <c355e3b> Databases will ship a custom one which is tuned to work with its internals, langauges will give you a general library which is optimized for the common cases
[22:16:31] <Guest16> ok, for storing data we use database, right?
[22:16:43] <companion_cube> databases are often built on B-trees
[22:16:59] <Guest16> so it is under the hood, i mean we never need to built it , right?

[22:17:09] <c355e3b> Uhh no

[23:55:57] <Suikerverbruiker> Hi all, I noticed a comment earlier today be djsumdog (https://lobste.rs/s/qvpdhm/safari_extension_redirect_sites_privacy#c_cwq22x) asking a question about an FF translation plugin.

[23:56:32] <Suikerverbruiker> I just wanted to briefly let them know that it is indeed just Google translate, as can be seen in the source code: https://github.com/sienori/simple-translate/blob/6b8f58dc72fe2c06af4bed2d3b9c95f3d3754159/src/common/translate.js#L28

[23:58:12] <Suikerverbruiker> Not sure if they're present here, but maybe someone can time to comment the answer to them. (I don't have an account of my own, hence why I can't do it myself)
[23:58:44] *** visl_ is now known as visl
