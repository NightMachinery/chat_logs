[00:00:52] <acu> StyXman, thanks for advice - again I have a slur of other applications that I use in my laptop - if I enable backport - there will be a mix of versions

[00:02:47] <sney> installing 1 package from bullseye-backports is not "enable backport"
[00:02:50] <sney> it's installing one packagd
[00:03:00] <sney> the kernel is self-contained and does not need any more new stuff

[00:04:32] <acu> so I could do perhaps apt install firmware-iwlwifi

[00:05:01] <StyXman> sney: I thought backoprt enabled pining too
[00:05:21] <sney> acu: the driver is in the kernel package. newer firmware will do 0 without the new driver
[00:05:37] <sney> StyXman: yeah, it's pinned at a very low priority by default as well
[00:06:00] <StyXman> sney: so ir _is_ possible to just install one backport
[00:06:04] <StyXman> is it?
[00:06:19] <StyXman> I din'tmean to download the .debs by hand, no
[00:06:26] <Khepra> that's not really true tho, specific firmware doesn't necessarily require specific kernel version
[00:07:21] <acu> StyXman: I used to install from backports years ago - dependencies might be an issue too - an app from backport might require dependencies with newer version than in stable main - so you end up having a mixture of versions
[00:07:38] <acu> OK - so I should try the firmware
[00:07:43] <acu> let me see
[00:07:46] <sney> acu: you're the one talking about applications from backports. nobody else said that. only kernel

[00:09:21] <StyXman> sney: I think acu thought that enabling backports would mean that any other package in that repo would superceed the ones he has in the system, as if they were updates to those
[00:09:33] <StyXman> the newer versios...
[00:09:34] <sney> StyXman: yeah, something they imagined and didn't check
[00:10:08] <StyXman> sney: don't get grumpy :-P
[00:10:35] <Khepra> you don't need newer kernel to use newer firmware unless the newer kernel is asking for specific files that are available only in newer firmware package.
[00:10:58] <sney> the time you can save if you say "but if I get the kernel from bullseye-backports, won't that upgrade everything to backports?" and we can say no and then there's no confusion
[00:11:11] <StyXman> ok, so try to upgrade the firmware package and see if it pulls a new kernel
[00:11:36] <sney> it won't, but it probably also won't make the wifi work
[00:11:44] <StyXman> sney: agreed, but his previous experience seems to help him assume there is no alternative
[00:12:12] <StyXman> sney: shouldn't that be handled by deps, then?
[00:12:35] <sney> sounds more like previous paranoia to me, since bpo has never ever been an "upgrade everything" proposition, in fact everything says not to do that
[00:12:59] <sney> dpkg doesn't check for hardware support.
[00:12:59] <dpkg> sney: wish i knew
[00:13:18] <Khepra> StyXman: it should if it mattered. again, there's no rule that says newer firmware requires newer kernel.
[00:13:38] <sney> installing a new firmware package can enable a driver if firmware files are *missing* but won't magically enable a driver that isn't new enough for the device. and some ax210s are on the border
[00:13:39] <Khepra> kernel is asking for specific file. if that file is present, it'll be loaded, regarldess of teh package version
[00:13:50] <StyXman> sney: ... if the newer firmware does not work with old kernels, it should have a Depends: on the version whereit works, that's what I meant
[00:14:01] <Khepra> sney: yes that's correct, but is orthogonal to the version and neweness of the firmware
[00:14:23] <Khepra> again, the kernel must require specific files. if teh newer firmware package is carrying files that thte older kernel isn't asking for then of course, it won't matter.
[00:14:34] <sney> yes
[00:14:58] <Khepra> however newer firmware files might contain updated firmwre code in the same firmware file

[00:15:45] <sney> acu_: any luck?
[00:16:14] <StyXman> hmm, I see. I would have expected it to depend on the kernel that fits better

It worked up until the point i had an M14 usb-c monitor attached and changed the desktop settings in gnome from "expanded monitor" to mirrored. I remeber then pulling the USB cable to re-adjust the monitor and when plugging it back in, the port ceased to work completely.

[11:45:42] <Wade> you know, since there's data on the volume now and there wasn't then
[11:45:48] <Wade> it took 26hrs to move all the data

[14:53:05] <cosimone> hello, i have a few questions, first of all, is the fwupd-refresh.service systemd unit provided by debian itself?  the reason i'm asking is because it's apparently enabled by default (through the corresponding timer) in new installs as of debian 11.2.  however, if the network is not present when the service triggers, the service fails (systemctl status shows "degraded" state).  looking at the unit file itself (fwupd-refresh.service), it
[14:53:05] <cosimone> seems like it has an After= ordering on network.target, but not on network-online.target.  It does not have any kind of actual dependency, such as Requires= or After=.

[14:54:30] <cosimone> which leads to the following question:  is this unit file correct in not doing so?  i don't think that fwupd-refresh should fail and leave the system in a "degraded" state just because the network was down, it should just not run.  in particular, this should be addressed considering that the coresponding timer appears to be enabled by default on new debian installs

[15:06:37] <Khepra> and isn't fwupd in total conflict with packaged firmware? what about non-free
[15:07:15] <cosimone> Khepra: it was there on every install i did recently with GNOME
[15:07:26] <Khepra> huh.
[15:07:31] <cosimone> if it shouldn't actually be pulled in by default, that's yet another matter

[15:08:08] <Khepra> I don't know, that's what I'm asking. I always steered clear from it due to the very nature of it
[15:08:52] <cosimone> i can install a new debian system asap in a vm to check, but i'm quite positive that it's the case
[15:09:01] <Khepra> and yeah I see gnome pulling it in.
[15:09:14] <cosimone> i see
[15:09:48] <cosimone> if it shouldn't be pulled in, but it ends up actually being pulled in... i'd say it's a bug nonetheless.  i don't seem to see anything of the sort already reported, though
[15:09:57] <Khepra> kde doesn't for example (task-kde-desktop)
[15:11:01] <cosimone> i see.  xfce doesn't seem to pull it in either, i just checked on an install i have here in a vm
[15:11:09] <Khepra> I don't know if it's a bug. I would suppose so, as that would conflict with packaged firmware, so it'd need to be somethig very much optional and deliberately, consciously installed by teh user.
[15:11:37] <Khepra> there have been horror stories with insufficiently tested firmware pushed to LVFS
[15:11:55] <cosimone> i see.  do you know if gnome actually needs it by any chance?  maybe something to do with gnome-software?  of course, it's not a bug if it is actually needed, but it seems quite strange, as you point out
[15:12:53] <Khepra> I don't think it's needed. I think it's one of those "convenience ideas" that sound good on paper, but are terrible in practice, like unattended upgrades and now fwupd.
[15:13:32] <cosimone> i see.  so it should be at most an "optional" dependency, and not a "recommends", let alone "depends" dependency, in your opinion?
[15:14:07] <cosimone> running aptitude why fwupd shows that gnome-software indeed recommends it, as i suspected
[15:14:17] <cosimone> however, it doesn't seem to be a hard dependency

[15:15:06] <Khepra> gods bless APT::Install-Recommends "false";   :)

[15:15:51] <cosimone> i'm aware of that option, but it seems like we are discussing defaults
[15:16:10] <cosimone> of course you can also choose to install everything, including optional dependencies

[15:17:13] <Khepra> take smartmontools. it's a simple tool that checks disk SMART data. but it has a daemon. and the daemon is configured to email you warnings, and that alone pulls in an entire MTA if you're not careful.

[15:18:10] <cosimone> i'm aware of that.  the point here is that you seem to suggest that fwupd specifically is *not* something that one "should" have unless they explicitly choose to
[15:18:23] *** Joins: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy)
[15:18:51] <Khepra> cosimone: that is my opinion yes. it also flies against debian's "stable" policies of testing and curating software before it becomes available to users.
[15:19:39] *** Quits: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:19:44] <cosimone> yes, it's strange that a service that fails for something as basic as not being online ends up being installed in a default install with gnome (which seems to be the "default" desktop environment)
[15:19:50] <Khepra> that's why I think it's a bug, to install it as part of Stable setup, without explicitely asking the user if they want to break the "Stable" promise for firmware and have all the V in LVFS basically push software to your computer whenever.
[15:19:53] *** Joins: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy)
[15:20:47] <cosimone> i see.  i can double check by doing a fresh install with no changes whatsoever to the default setup, which should leave me with gnome and fwupd
[15:21:12] <cosimone> i'd probably file the bug against gnome-software specifically, because that's what recommends fwupd in the first place

[15:26:27] <Khepra> before you do that, is fwupd just installed, timer and all, but doesn't actually do anything until some etc/default/ or other condition is flipped to "ON"?

[15:27:11] <cosimone> it shows up in systemctl list-timers
[15:27:24] <Khepra> that could still not do anything beacuse it's not configured to actually fetch and install firmware
[15:27:56] <Khepra> for example, debian always installs apt-daily-upgrade.timer. but taht doesn't do anything without unattended ugprade aldo being present
[15:28:38] <cosimone> probably, but that would further beg the question of why it is recommended in the first place
[15:28:50] <cosimone> but i don't think that's the case anyway, let me double check to make sure

[15:35:45] <cosimone> one for gnome-software (which shouldn't recommend fwupd) and the other for fwupd itself
[15:35:56] <Khepra> cosimone: so my argument would be that fwupd should not be installed by default, even if it worked, because it breaks the Stable release promise and amounts to upgrading firmware-pacakges randomly. by unaudited process at the mercy of all the vendors in the LVFS programme.
[15:36:23] *** Joins: blingrang_ (~blingrang@user/blingrang)
[15:36:57] <Khepra> and unlike buggy regular software one can apt uninstall, buggy firmware can brick hardware. as it already happened with ubuntu few years ago.
[15:37:31] <cosimone> indeed, that sounds like a convincing argument for the bug report about gnome-software
[15:38:51] <cosimone> i am installing an ultra vanilla debian install right now on a spare vm just to double check that it actually does end up installed by default somehow.  after that, i will file the bug against gnome-software to remove the "recommends" dependency

To hold a package 'echo $package hold|dpkg --set-selections' or 'aptitude hold $package'.

[20:34:25] <movah4c> dist-upgrade right ?
[20:34:36] <cosimone> i can confirm  the exact problem movah4c pointed out, and i'm on the latest stable linux kernel (5.10.0-11-amd64)

[20:37:54] <acu> Interesting find - Intel AX 210 WIFI (and bluetooth) - was not recognized on Debian 11.2 (with non-free firmware) though It is said that kernel 5.10+ has the driver in the kernel ---  I needed to install the backports and update the kernel - that is 10.15 - now the card is seen and working - I wish I do not need to install the backport - as now I have a mixture of applications versions - and defeats my initial need to have a signle

[23:53:41] <gumbo> does debian have a repo that is community driven? like for arch they have the AUR ubuntu has ppa etc.. ?
[23:53:52] *** Quits: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:54:49] <somiaj> gumbo: debian's main repo is community driven, if software isn't in that repo it is most likely that it cannot be packaged for debian (for various reason such as the DFSG) or no one has taken the time to make the package meet debian policy.
[23:55:13] <gumbo> ok
[23:55:29] <somiaj> so in general, there really isn't a need, and it would be preferable that if someone wants to package something for the community they go through the mentors.debian.net process to add the package to debian
[23:55:45] <dminuoso> Hah, or as I have recently learned, if the upstream maintainers are particularly hostile.
[23:55:45] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror)
[23:55:53] <dminuoso> That's another case packages dont exist.
[23:56:02] <duckgoose> using git is always an option
[23:56:14] <somiaj> so third party repos are often due to the packages not being good enough quality to get into debian (note there are rare exceptions to this like sury which is tring to packgae multiple versions of php for older debian releases)
[23:56:19] <dminuoso> As surprising as it may be, but some people go out of their way to be extremely hostile against inclusion of ones package in distribution XYZ...

[23:58:02] <somiaj> gumbo: you can search the wnpp bugs, and see if anyone has made a request for that. You can file an RFP bug to get software in debian you think would be useful. Though unless someone steps up to do the work, it is often better if someone volunteers to package something for debian.
