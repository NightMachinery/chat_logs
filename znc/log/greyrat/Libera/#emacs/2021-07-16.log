[01:29:30] <veracioux> hi, can i have a local init file that emacs loads whenever i work in that directory (noob spacemacs user here)
[01:30:02] <corwin> ,,dir-local
[01:30:05] <fsbot> [->] directoryvariables: (info "(emacs)Directory Variables") <https://emacswiki.org/emacs/DirectoryVariables> see also <filelocalvariables>
[01:30:07] <aidalgol> Anyway, that doesn't quite make sense, because changing the keyboard layout in hardware would change the keycodes it sends, so that the OS doesn't need to change its layout.
[01:30:15] <aidalgol> veracioux: Yeah, what corwin said.
[01:30:23] <veracioux> i thought that works for variables only
[01:30:30] <veracioux> i can run any commands in that file?
[01:30:30] <aidalgol> You can have an eval block in it.
[01:30:43] <corwin> you can do eval: sorta... what aidalgol

[03:49:43] <corwin> I think partially true is a lot less misleading here.  The substance of the claim is that FOX (though an affiliate) sued for the right to block stores it doesn't want to publish.

[06:29:28] <edgar-rft> The reason for no generalized pop function is that you need to find the matching item(s) in the sequence and there is a myriad of edge-cases what "matching" could mean.

[07:00:27] <dragestil_> Aurora_v_kosmose: is that all that's needed, webext support, for the major firefox extensions to work on nyxt?
[07:00:29] <Guest3778> yo're in luck there's a browser @gragestil_ https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/
[07:00:36] <Guest3778> oh lol you already know
[07:00:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dragestil_: Pretty much yes.
[07:00:50] <dragestil_> Guest3778: :p
[07:01:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The hooks for the specific functionality are technically available but the high-level API for webext is yet to be done.
[07:01:05] <Guest3778> I'm having a weird issue where after I install packages and autoremove some, parts of my .emacs get moved around
[07:01:22] <Guest3778> Its happened for a second time and I think that's the trigger
[07:01:42] <dale> Guest3778: Adding/removing packages will cause customize to try and modify the forms it puts in .emacs by default.
[07:01:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So you could hack Nyxt itself to do the work... but by the time you're done rewriting umatrix from scratch in CL, proper webext might be usable.
[07:01:46] <dragestil_> Aurora_v_kosmose: is there a bug tracker link
[07:03:30] *** grettke is now known as grettke-away
[07:04:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/32
[07:04:46] <dragestil_> dale: hmm all the about:config overrides seem to be in prefs.js

[07:06:07] <dragestil_> Aurora_v_kosmose: thanks
[07:06:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dragestil_: Nyxt could use a more accurate tracking, the issue is spread over several actual github issues.
[07:07:09] <dragestil_> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah but it sounds normal for a most wanted feature to me
[07:07:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed.

[07:20:45] <fsbot> The default is nil, which means to use your init file

[07:28:41] <dale> Guest3778: If you're talking about (require 'flymake-shellcheck), no, I think you should be able to load your custom-file before that require.

[07:59:41] <homerj> when you get an HVAC setup, they take that into consideration, if you can't remove humidity, more AC isn't going to do anything
[08:00:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> homerj: That generally involves some more or less elaborate draining methods, no?
[08:00:41] <himesama> we have a refrigerator that does not freeze well because it is so hot.  i was wondering whether it would freeze better if the humidity were lower for the same temperature.
[08:01:17] <homerj> yeah
[08:01:22] <dale> My central A/C just has a drain to the outside.  Sometimes you have a lil' condensation pump.
[08:01:42] <homerj> bonus if you just get a dehumidifier that has a bucket it fills, that's like the best water to use for plants
[08:02:58] <homerj> my office somehow has negitive humidity
[08:03:03] <dale> Now let me show you the damage in my ceiling where the drain pipe got clogged and so the A/C just ended up overflowing its pan.
[08:04:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> homerj: I think they might just have a faulty sensor. It can't be negative.

[11:21:45] <aidalgol> I'm honestly not sure what magic is going on under the hood with options that say not to set them directly.
[11:22:14] <rnkn> custom-set-variables is emacs's inbuilt options UI

[13:50:42] <empwilli_> probably, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Class-Table.html isn't very specific on that topic, though
[13:50:45] <corwin> anyway, solid choice on your answer, I'd say.
[13:51:46] <corwin> empwilli_: I remember reading that [[:space:]] will vary based on the syntax table, which I think is influenced by the node.  E.g. some modes/languages consider - a word bounder char, others don't.
[13:52:04] <corwin> influenced by *mode
[13:52:08] <empwilli_> hmmmm ... with emacs -Q it works

[14:37:11] <twb> I used to try to grab onto trams and make them tow me
[14:37:15] <codingquark> I _really_ need to switch. Of course there's my degrading health
[14:37:16] <twb> But the tram drivers didn't like that
[14:37:26] <codingquark> twb: why not?
[14:37:43] <twb> codingquark: well firstly because I'm stealing their electricity, and secondly because it's super dangerous
[14:38:38] <corwin> dead give away you aren't american.  we always list liability first, as a matter of policy.
[14:39:02] <codingquark> twb: I suppose it is dangerous. In school, a couple of friends used to have motor vehicles. We used to grab onto their shoulder to tow our bicycle. One person per vehicle
[14:39:16] <codingquark> In retrospect, that was VERY dangerous
[14:39:38] <yeti> I saw resulting crashs
[14:39:46] <codingquark> corwin: pardon that one. Kindly elaborate!
[14:39:47] <corwin> in the winter we'd put on our moon boots and pull each other around the snow packed dirt roads with a pick-up
[14:40:19] <codingquark> yeti: I did crash once, we were at 50km/h at least and I couldn't hold on to the shoulder. No bones broken which I consider a win

[14:42:22] <yeti> maybe it is like with the hot plate
[14:42:39] <yeti> kids only beleive it is dangerous when they had that experience
[14:43:08] <corwin> the butt of it is that in order to sell anything in america one needs to put a warning label on it.  if you can't do that, you can't sell it (not true, of course).  so, basically, if there's any risk that you could get hurt and sue, for example, the owner of the place where you got hurt (for not telling you not to do the obvs dumb thing), we'll tend to preemptively tell you not to do "dumb" things.
[14:43:09] <yeti> or darwin award worthy?

[21:30:05] <bpalmer> libfud: c-offsets-alist will be changed whenever you change the C style (M-x c-set-style RET) ; in theory, if you've got a consistent style, you should define a style and then just change c-default-style

[22:52:07] <fsmunoz> wasamasa: I'll make them an offer they can't refuse
[22:52:10] <fsmunoz> ...
[22:52:10] <wasamasa> and wait for yaml-mode to land in GNU ELPA
[22:52:22] <wasamasa> oh wait, you said without installing packages
[22:52:34] <wasamasa> make a convincing case on emacs-devel to include it in core
[22:52:37] <quippy> yaml-mode can't figure out how to indent properly
[22:52:39] <quippy> what is with that
[22:52:51] <quippy> I assume I can fix it with some configuration but out of the box it's just stupid
[22:52:58] <wasamasa> no, you can't really fix that
[22:53:05] <quippy> ugh
[22:53:08] <fsmunoz> wasamasa: right, ty. I think that my use-case is so fringe that I would feel a bit awkward about suggesting it.
[22:53:16] <quippy> well thanks for saving me the time trying anyway wasamasa, that was definitely on my todo list
[22:53:25] <wasamasa> I maintain yaml-mode these days
[22:53:35] <quippy> I apologize for calling it stupid
[22:53:36] <wasamasa> most of the issues on the bug tracker I can do nothing about
[22:53:40] <fsmunoz> To be clear, it's that I use emacs in certification exams , and those environments allow me access to the OS packages, but not to the internet.
[22:54:08] <fsmunoz> Hardly a common scenario tbh
[22:54:10] <wasamasa> because to do better you'd need to make something like enh-yaml-mode that actually parses it using libyaml
[22:54:31] <wasamasa> then indentation and syntax highlighting could be done properly
[22:54:43] <wasamasa> fsmunoz: I'd seriously consider to use vim or something else then
[22:55:09] <fsmunoz> yeah that's what I thought. yaml-mode works fine for me locally (I don't have big requirement, this is esentially for ansible files)
[22:55:26] <fsmunoz> My solution above gets me by, more than using vim anyway.
[22:55:34] <Guest25> so it turns out that its not company mode, with that disabled, normal completions can push the cursor back up into the buffer
[22:55:53] <fsmunoz> ty wasamasa, much helpful.
[22:56:29] <Guest25> is there a hook or something I can attach to to debug when the cursor changes position?
[22:57:03] <wasamasa> you could write something for pre-/post-command-hook and check point
