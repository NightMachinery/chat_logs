[21:49:08] <hinst> Please talk
[21:51:21] <TheFlash> bla bla bla
[21:53:04] <Renderwww> windows drivers for steamdick were just releaseed, looks like year of linux on the desktop was canceled once again
[21:53:19] <Renderwww> I hope they are shit
[21:54:49] <Renderwww> ha, audio drivers are still massing
[21:54:54] <Renderwww> it's almost like linux!
[22:01:11] <TheFlash> I don't think Steam gameboythingie would contribute to year of linux on the desktop. Also, I don't care if the Windows drivers are shit or good, I could still use Linux on it if I bought one.
[22:03:08] <Renderwww> but you can but it into kde!
[22:05:48] <TheFlash> You can. But I believe lots of people who buy it wont use it for anything :)
[22:06:56] <Renderwww> they use it to install emulators
[22:09:07] <TheFlash> That's one group. That's why I am marginally interested.
[22:14:32] <TheFlash> I know some people who will probably buy one. Just because they can't avoid buying gadgets that are somewhat trendy. And most of them I don't see using them.
[22:17:24] <Renderwww> I obviously had to buy one because loonix
[22:18:41] <TheFlash> I am not judging you for that. =)
[22:26:37] <TheFlash> It's cheaper than I expected. If the ETA for delivery would not be "After Q3 2022" I might have just impulse bought one :)
[22:27:13] <TheFlash> I thought it would be something close to 1k EUR
[22:28:47] <Renderwww> the cheap one is pretty good value for the money
[22:29:17] <TheFlash> Did you already get one?
[22:29:26] <Renderwww> i have the expensive one
[22:29:38] <TheFlash> When did you order it?
[22:30:03] <Renderwww> in the first couple of minutes when they opened orders
[22:30:09] <Renderwww> last year june or something
[22:30:13] <TheFlash> Ah.
[22:31:26] <TheFlash> I like instant gratification too much to spend money for such long waiting time.
[22:33:09] <Renderwww> you have to spend 5 bucks to reserve it and pay the rest only once you actually can order it
[22:33:43] <TheFlash> That's too much already.
[22:34:02] <Renderwww> ha
[22:34:24] <TheFlash> Also sounds like planning something ahead more than few days. I am not adult enough for that!
[22:35:18] <Renderwww> you'll miss out on this in bed https://i.redd.it/zpjzao0gqjm81.jpg !
[22:36:54] <TheFlash> Hehe
[22:38:26] <TheFlash> Convincing, but i still opt for waiting until I can buy one without queueing.
