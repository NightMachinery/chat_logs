[01:14:06] <slips> Hm, i'm having brain think issues, maybe one of you guys knows more about bash scripting than I do. I'm currently writing a set of install scripts for Artix. I say a set, because I split my install scripts into two parts, one pre-chroot and one post chroot. My issue is, I want it to ask for what init system to install one time, and not again. But i'm not 100% sure how to do that with how i write
[01:14:08] <slips> these scripts. So i'm trying to think of a way to carry over what the init variable is between scripts.
[01:14:58] <slips> Currently am leaning towards having the first script write a value to a file within /mnt/ that is then read by the second script, but maybe someone here has a better idea?

[06:04:09] <kevr> i'm serving out some .gz files in nginx but they get renamed when downloaded. anyone know of a way to... force it to not rename these? example: `packages.gz` gets actually downloaded as `35ApUmUV.gz`, but i'd like to just have it be downloaded on computers at packages.gz, as requested.
[06:04:11] <kevr> any clue?

[12:04:20] <baltazar> after all, everything works after restarting them (kwin_x11, plasmashell, etc)
[12:04:58] <baltazar> so I guess it would work 100% if I ran that command before anything starts. does sddm / plasma / idk read xinitrc or something?

[15:30:05] <Vamp898> Hi there, i setup OpenDKIM according to this Wiki page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenDKIM#Postfix_integration and it works ot the point where i can read "external host ABC attempted to send as XYZ". So OpenDKIM correctly detects that someone is sending with an domain who is not allowed to use that domain. Fine! But how can i block it now?
[15:30:05] <Vamp898> The Email still gets forwarded just fine and the recipient is getting the Email sent using forged sender address. If ClamAV detects Malware (or an Malware Testfile like EICAR), the Email gets blocked. If OpenDKIM detects an forged sender, he just reports it in the logs

[15:48:53] <Vamp898> I once had an Matrix Server #goodolddays. Everyone hated me for that as one client was worse than the other. I was able to cause many people who did not care about FLOSS to hate FLOSS. Anyway, i think i found the issue. The SPF is still set to soft-fail. That most likely causes OpenDKIM to accept the mail, even though it knows its a forged sender.
[15:48:54] <Vamp898> Guess have to change that to hard-file to actually cause any results

[17:58:38] <b-rex> i guess i have overkill on the workarounds
[17:58:47] <UndeadLeech> So if someone runs into this problem but likes the automatic scaling, that would get broken.
[17:58:49] <b-rex> no biggie.... until the next xorg update :D

[17:59:56] <b-rex> UndeadLeech: i have the automatic scaling off because i have this huge monitor i plug into that is also 1920x1080 and alacritty's automatic scaling makes the fonts so tiny on that thing you can't read them at all

[18:00:25] <UndeadLeech> Nice. Yeah it definitely isn't ideal, xorg just wasn't really built for that.

[18:01:27] <umaxtu> b-rex: how do you disable alacritty's autoscaling?
[18:02:01] <UndeadLeech> Either set Xft.dpi in xresources or using `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=<SCALE_FACTOR (like 1)>`.
[18:02:02] <kiraslaugh> Hi everyone, I am struggling to figure out why my windows and text have gotten so big. I was installing virtualbox yesterday and after rebooting my computer all of the windows that I open are huge.
[18:02:28] <b-rex> umaxtu: export WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR=1.6666666666666667
[18:02:46] <brejela> kiraslaugh: Sounds like the same Xorg problems many people are having right now.
[18:02:55] <umaxtu> thanks.  I was hoping I could disable it just for Alacritty though since thats usually the only program that I have an issue with scalingwise
[18:03:23] *** Quits: p7cq (~p7cq@109.101.232.200) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[18:03:27] <UndeadLeech> You can put any env export in Alacritty's alacritty.yml env section and that works just for Alacritty.

[18:04:55] <umaxtu> you can hardcode your dpi
[18:05:03] <brejela> kiraslaugh: The easiest solution I tried and worked is adding "-- -dpi 96" to the startx command. But that doesn't seem to work for everyone
[18:05:36] <brejela> kiraslaugh: b-rex 's solution is also possible, but as he said, it is no ideal either.

[22:00:18] <vd> if a software does its own thing because it didn't find a nameserver entry in resolv.conf, then it makes sense to add one to avoid this behavior.

[22:22:42] <Forty-Bot> kevr: in this case, the database is local and I am using "peer" auth
[22:22:47] <kevr> the shebang is for your shell to know which entry program to use to process a particular executable file
[22:22:52] <kevr> it has nothing to do with sql
[22:22:58] <Forty-Bot> well, techniocally it's for execve()

[22:23:41] <kevr> you're trying to use a shebang to actually call the program for the script contents
[22:24:04] <kevr> like a psql shebang
[22:24:23] <Forty-Bot> yeah, the issue is that the runner always calls the script like "$SHELL -c my_script $@"
[22:24:35] <Forty-Bot> and psql needs the script to be passed as -f

[23:21:06] <grawity> I don't think any bittorrent clients use fancy holepunching, just NAT-PMP / UPnP to set up straight port-forwardings?
[23:21:07] <tyzoid> Singapore, japan, australia, india, etc. mirrors would be vastly quicker
[23:21:30] <grawity> meaning, in the end, if all peers were behind NAT without port-forwarding, then none of them would be able to talk
[23:21:48] <MacGyver> I honestly don't know.
[23:21:55] <MacGyver> You may be right.
[23:22:59] <grawity> when *some* peers are behind NAT without port-forwarding – assuming no IPv6 either – they can of course still talk to peers who *do* have it set up (as well as hosts with public IP addresses, e.g. the big-ass seedboxes), but I don't feel like that's a good situation

[23:53:19] <mikebutash> moonshine: I don't exactly disagree, if you go to the effort of port-forwarding, it shows intent to traffic in files, when innocuous files, great.

[23:55:26] <mikebutash> if seeding something more dubious, and you took the effort to port-forward to facilitate doing so, well then, there is some reasonable intent that says don't blame your neighbor or guest wifi for random bad actor.

[23:59:44] <mikebutash> not to endorse piracy in any way, just don't do dumb shit like enable upnp or even manually port-forward your firewall to be helpful in seeding content as it could entirely be misconstrued.
[23:59:44] <moonshine> sure, i don't disagree with the decisions. bittorrent probably would have been sued into oblivion otherwise. otoh, publishing a port shouldn't by itself speak to intent.
