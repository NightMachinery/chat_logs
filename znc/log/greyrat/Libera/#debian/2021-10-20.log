[13:54:35] <Khepra> those are http URLs. check them with a browser

[13:55:44] *** Joins: Seng (~nick@hurtig.ninja)
[13:55:45] <Khepra> that doesn't sound right. what will your script do if a check returns failure? you should check the sources and code them as configuration for your installation script
[13:56:04] <rendar> ok
[13:56:14] <Khepra> meanwhile, should be possible to parse apt update output or return value, if you want programmatic check that sources are valid
[13:57:44] <Khepra> also, it's recommended you always test your installation or upgrade procedures, with a VM or something. Surely you're not going into production with untested installation scripts?

[14:01:29] <Seng> Hey guys. I have a question about latop batteries. I have a new aftermarket battery for my old laptop - it worked for a week or two, but now my laptop dies whenever I unplug the power cord, despite the battery being 100% charged. That is - the computer (and upower) says 100% charged, but upower also says it's Voltage is 8V (which I have confirmed by measuring the cells directly with a multimeter). It's supposed to be 10.8V at least. Can I tell my Debian
[14:01:29] <Seng> installation it's a blatant lie and force it to charge the battery or is it something with the battery controller?
[14:01:38] <rendar> Khepra, good idea
[14:02:42] <Haohmaru> Seng is it 8V when it's being charged?
[14:02:53] <Khepra> Seng: "force it to change the battery"?
[14:03:05] <Haohmaru> "charge"
[14:03:22] <Khepra> ooooo. sorry. too much blood in my coffee stream
[14:04:12] *** Sir_Burns is now known as MrBurns
[14:04:39] <Seng> Haohmaru, just measured, the voltage across the cells, while charging, is 8.006V.
[14:05:00] <Seng> Khepra, I expect a lot from my computer :)

[14:06:55] *** Joins: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract)
[14:07:09] <Haohmaru> Seng so it goes to 8V and not any higher and then the OS thinks it's "charged" and stops charging?
[14:08:39] <Seng> Output from upower; https://pastebin.com/v8sBVN2z
[14:08:50] <Seng> Haohmaru, that's my theory
[14:09:35] <Seng> Either the system stops pushing power into the battery, or the circuitry on the battery is refusing the power reaching the cells.

[14:09:59] <Haohmaru> hm
[14:10:20] <Seng> So if I somehow could try and say "hey, my battery is only at 80%" maybe the system could start charging it.
[14:10:24] <Haohmaru> unfortunately i'm not a fan of battery-powered "computers" so i have no experience
[14:10:53] *** Quits: chrissl (~chrissl@80.121.186.66) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:10:56] <Seng> and if that didn't do anything maybe the issue was the battery itself. I'm more into software than hardware, so I thought I would start here first :)
[14:11:02] <Haohmaru> if this "upower" is responsible for dealing with the battery charging, maybe check its documentation
[14:11:29] <Haohmaru> altho i think these fancy batteries often have an actual charging controller thing
[14:11:32] <Seng> I only think it's responsible for reading the battery stats - not sure tbh.
[14:11:42] <sussudio> if you shut down the laptop and then let it charge, the OS has nothing to do with it.
[14:11:59] <Seng> hm. true that sussudio. Good point.
[14:12:01] <sussudio> you could just have a dud battery, it happens.

[14:15:39] <Seng> Also the battery worked, flawlessfly, for a week or two.
[14:15:49] <Haohmaru> hm
[14:16:22] <Seng> It's one of those mystery cases where nothing makes sense! :)
[14:16:25] <Haohmaru> what's the input source? some adapter thing?

[17:08:06] <jkc> FightingFalcon: If your passwords are so terrible that someone brute forces an account on your box before the sun reaches "white dwarf" phase, then your ssh port is not the solution.
[17:08:10] <abff> FightingFalcon: tru al

[17:09:32] <Bombo> 'generated by connection manager' is that 'modemmanager' ?
[17:09:37] <jkc> FightingFalcon: Service port numbers are not secrets. That is a stereotypical example of security by obscurity. See also "Shannon's Maxim," NIST SP 800-123, et al.
[17:09:37] <x10d> FightingFalcon: if you install fail2ban, you can define how many wrong passwords can be used, and then block incoming traffic for that IP

[17:10:44] <jkc> FightingFalcon: fail2ban is a good (great, actually) solution.

[17:11:02] <jkc> FightingFalcon: So now you can leave ssh on the port where it belongs. :)

[17:12:24] <jkc> abff: You can mitigate that at least somewhat by expanding the window in which fail2ban looks for consecutive auth failures.
[17:12:30] <jkc> Especially if you only ever auth with a pubkey.
[17:12:33] <Bombo> hm and after upgrade to 11 firefox 93 from mozilla doesn't react when i click on the gui, acts weird, firefox-esr works tho

[17:12:53] <abff> jkc indeed, I did some tweaking but I got lazy

[17:13:00] <abff> I also blacklisted most of the net lol
[17:14:01] <PerfDave> TBH I use all three. I use a nonstandard port for SSH, and then fail2ban. fail2ban on port 22 is just too noisy. Key-only auth means you still get lots of connect + dropoff.
