I am looking for a bash one liner that can search all the files on a hard drive for occurances of several text phrases that are found in the files in close proximity to one another. Lets say within 50 characters. Anyone have a simple way of doing that I was thiking because drive contains files that should be searched through that using  find with -exec and greping the results of one se
[01:11:40] <transhumanist> nother some how. Thanks in advance

[01:15:50] <emanuele6> oh
[01:15:51] <tirnanog> "within 50 characters". it's going to require some programming.
[01:16:17] <twkm> you'd want a non-standard grep-like too for that, like ack or glark.
[01:16:18] <tirnanog> also, 50 characters including newlines or not.
[01:17:07] <tirnanog> where would I find the homepage of glark?
[01:17:12] <transhumanist> tirnanog:  sorry to be a pain in the ass but yes they can be a few lines away basically its contained in .json files or html files mainly but not always

[01:17:57] <greybot> There isn't a world shortage of bash commands, and having newlines in your script does not make it slower
[01:19:08] <transhumanist> I guess the requirement of not being a one liner is realisitic, sorry  for throwing that in the mix, it wasnt intended
[01:19:16] <tirnanog> well, json can be collapsed, in which case the premise of a 50 character distance might make sense (sort of). sounds a bit odd, though.
[01:19:31] <transhumanist> I used to have a program about 30 years ago that did this for me nicely , but alas that was a very very long time ago
[01:19:53] <tirnanog> that is, it's a well structured format, so speaking of character distances is a bit odd, unless you mean in the context of a key's value, say.

[09:05:44] <emanuele6> because you are assigning to a readonly variable..
[09:05:53] <obiwahn> and why would shellcheck suggest to assign a value later to a read only variable?
[09:06:08] <tirnanog> not the first time, but on the second and subsequent occasions. it can't be readonly.
[09:06:14] <tirnanog> so don't do that.
[09:06:24] <emanuele6> declare -r re='.*'"$skip_item"'.*'
[09:06:35] <tirnanog> if you think that variables are lexically scoped like in some other languages, they're not.
[09:07:05] <emanuele6> but that code is wrong anyway
[09:07:12] <tirnanog> by which I mean, the scope of the re variable is not confined to within the containing for loop.
[09:07:19] <emanuele6> the '.*'s are unnecessary
[09:07:32] <emanuele6> and "$skip_item" will be interpreted as a pattern
[09:07:38] <emanuele6> s/pattern/regex/
[09:07:59] <tirnanog> as for SC2155, it's true. you'll get the exit status value of declare, rather than readlink. it's a pitfall.
[09:08:05] <emanuele6> obiwahn: use [[ $d == *"$skip_item"* ]] instead of [[ "$d" =~ $re ]]
[09:08:13] <tirnanog> you're not acting on the exit status anyway, granted. still, shellcheck points it out.

[09:08:55] <shbot> tirnanog: 1
[09:08:59] <emanuele6> tirnanog: ok, but that is not relevant..
[09:09:16] <tirnanog> it's relevant if the questioner is asking a question about it.
[09:10:40] <tirnanog> as did, in point of fact, happened.
[09:12:56] <tirnanog> declare -r script="$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"
[09:13:15] <tirnanog> the fact that it contains -r is completely irrelevant to SC2155.
[09:15:37] <obiwahn> to fix that i would need to create a temporary variable to assign to the ro var?

[09:16:52] <tirnanog> in your case it makes no difference because you're ignoring the exit status value anyway.
[09:17:09] <emanuele6> obiwahn: re is a global variable

[09:17:33] <emanuele6> you can't re-assign to it in a loop

[09:17:48] *** Parts: JibStyle (~user@154.21.20.19) (d)
[09:17:51] <emanuele6> !readonly > readonlys are bad anyway
[09:17:52] <greybot> readonlys are bad anyway: Variables marked readonly (declare -r) are intended to be used with a restricted shell, to stop you from trivially changing PATH to escape the restrictions (etc.). They were never intended to be widely used in scripts. If you try, you will see odd results (-r at a global scope is passed down to local scopes).
[09:18:24] <obiwahn> oh
[09:18:35] <emanuele6> obiwahn: but anyway, in a regular expression, the initial and final .* are irrelevant
[09:18:51] <emanuele6> because, unless you use ^ or $, any substring will match
[09:19:31] <emanuele6> but there is still a problem with [[ "$d" =~ $re ]]
[09:19:58] <emanuele6> re='.*'"$skip_item"'.*' or re=$skip_item, $skip_item will be interpreted as a pattern, not literally
[09:20:10] <emanuele6> and that is not what you want
[09:21:16] <emanuele6> # skip_item='a+' re='.*'"$skip_item"'.*'; if [[ 'aaa' =~ $re ]]; then echo yes; else echo no; fi
[09:21:17] <shbot> emanuele6: yes
[09:21:22] <emanuele6> # skip_item='a+' re='.*'"$skip_item"'.*'; if [[ 'a+' =~ $re ]]; then echo yes; else echo no; fi
[09:21:23] <shbot> emanuele6: yes
[09:22:57] <emanuele6> obiwahn: what you want is [[ $d == *"$skip_item"* ]], i.e. a pattern comparison that is true if $d contains $skip_item literally
[09:23:10] <llua> but mah regex.
[09:23:20] <jetchisel> but..but... ^^
[09:23:52] <emanuele6> you could also use [[ $d =~ "$skip_item" ]] (note quotes around $skip_item), but regexes are more expensive than regular extpattern matching
[09:24:08] <obiwahn> *bla* does not work because the readlink resolves the symlinks

[12:50:37] <earnest> Hm, does that matter for regex like $?
[12:50:53] <earnest> grep doesn't generally care about lines per-se, although I suppose -c does
[12:51:14] <emanuele6> it cases about lines, because it prints the lines that match :P
[12:51:44] <emanuele6> # printf 'a line\nb line\n' | grep a
[12:51:45] <shbot> emanuele6: a line
[12:51:51] <emanuele6> the whole line that matches
[12:51:54] <earnest> Yeah, just not for the searching part, because looking for \n would be slow
[12:52:43] <earnest> emanuele6: I'm not refering to the output as such
[12:53:20] <earnest> Although -z does have the side effect of turning off the logic that detects a file containing a \0 as "binary"
[12:53:22] <emanuele6> GuiToris: !(video.mp4|*.wav) also works and is simplier
[12:53:57] <emanuele6> !(A|B) means (does NOT match A) AND (does NOT match B)
[12:54:42] <GuiToris> out of curiosity, what would the OR be here?
[12:55:20] <emanuele6> you mean (does NOT match A) OR (does NOT match B)? @(!(A)|!(B))
[12:55:38] <GuiToris> yes, that's what I meant thank you
[12:55:50] <GuiToris> can you direct me to the page where I can read more about @?
[12:55:56] <emanuele6> !extglob
[12:55:57] <greybot> "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
[12:56:07] <GuiToris> oh, it's also an extglob
[12:56:28] <GuiToris> I thought it was the same as [@]
[12:56:44] <GuiToris> I saw it with arrays, I think
[12:57:07] <emanuele6> no, "${arr[@]}" has nothing to do with this
[12:57:19] <GuiToris> got it, thank you
[12:57:25] <GuiToris> I'll play around with these globs
[12:58:13] <emanuele6> they are on by default in [[ $str == patternhere ]]
[12:58:37] <emanuele6> but you need to turn them on with `shopt -s extglob' if you want to use them elsewhere
[12:59:04] <GuiToris> will these extended globs ever be supported by the default bash?
[12:59:27] <emanuele6> they are supported, what do you mean?
[13:00:03] <emanuele6> they are just not on by default in `case' and in filename expansions for compatibility with portable shell
[13:00:13] <GuiToris> if 'shopt -s extglob' ever becomes obsolete
[13:00:33] <emanuele6> they are on by default in [[ $str == $pat ]] because [[ is bash-specific anyway
[13:01:38] <GuiToris> thank you for helping emanuele6 :)

[13:13:00] <lmat> I added set -ex; to the top and it looks like the program exits after the shift just after memo=$1; This function is being called without a fourh parameter, so that shift has nothing to shift.
