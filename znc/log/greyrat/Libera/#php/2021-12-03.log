[02:33:52] <Albright> restarting the server after each request will be even more effective
[02:35:37] <TML> restarting the server makes it hard to provide uptime - restarting one of hundreds of FPM processes has no such limitation
[02:36:28] <Albright> after each request, remove, dispose of, and replace the server

[02:53:07] <TML> Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is intended to prevent malicious actors from being able to fixate memory locations of key data structures and thus write shellcode which can exploit your services; however, in long-running services like FPM tends to be, they can use sequential requests to probe for the location and then attack it
[02:53:33] <TML> By killing the process after each request, the ASLR runs between requests, so there's no opportunity to fixate memory locations

[02:58:57] <TML> Usually the way it goes is: I find a request that allows me to smash your stack. Now I start doing pointer math to make the smashed stack jump to something interesting. But if the memory layout changes on every request, I can never do any pointer math, because they pointer values change on every request.

When I go to the archive site and download https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/php-8.0.8-Win32-vs16-x64.zip . After I unzip that and execute php -v it tells me its php 8.0.13. I think they archived the wrong version there. Any other places I can get the

[18:33:54] <judah> TML, just saw your message. I was on the job market for about a year before this place picked me up. A bit shy of a decade worth of experience in the stack, everything from racking servers to designing machine learning models and everything in between. Now, I have tried applying at hotels and fast food and the like, but none of them would hire
[18:34:38] <biberu> judah: where's that?
[18:34:44] <judah> Rural north Idaho
[18:34:49] <judah> The response they gave was with my background, it was clear that I would jump ship for the next best opportunity that came my way. Bit ironic seeing as their entire rest of the staff is doing the exact same thing, and I wouldnt be applying there if I had other options
[18:35:19] <biberu> you mean for the fast food work?
[18:35:27] <judah> Yup

[18:35:56] <judah> Luckily I got picked up by a Magento dev shop as an "entry level" tech. A decade of experience lands me back at square-1, but ill take it. Its the first offer I have had in a long time, I wont pass it up
[18:36:07] <judah> Even if I loath Magento, still have to pay the bills
[18:36:24] <biberu> eh, who really expects people to want to build a long career in fast food?
[18:36:52] <__adrian> judah: taylor your resume  :)  and yeah, that too - not like those are low-turnover fields

[18:37:15] <biberu> don't know anything about the job market in idaho, but over here my impression is that it's hard to find devs
[18:38:18] <judah> I interviewed for over a hundred positions before I got this one, from my perspective everyone says they are hiring but nobody is actually doing it. Either that or the people who need talent are not looking at job boards or working with head hunters
[18:38:36] <judah> Must be posting newspaper ads or something

[20:09:18] <__adrian> Tach: by "with variables" do you mean "with input"?
[20:10:00] <__adrian> and no, don't do anything you said there
[20:11:02] <Tach> __adrian you can call it input, just what the script, BASH, needs. What would your flow look like ?
[20:11:18] <Tach> judah needs to be bash
[20:11:24] <__adrian> https://php.net/cli  ← call your script with arguments
[20:11:39] <Tach> __adrian how to get the script in there ?
[20:11:44] *** Parts: velix (~velix@user/velix) (Leaving)
[20:11:52] <judah> You have ssh, why not use that?
[20:11:58] <__adrian> it should already be there? if it's not, ssh in and write it
[20:12:12] <judah> ssh into your box, then just run "php your_script_name_here.php"
[20:12:13] <__adrian> or scp it or whatever. that's a pre- step
[20:12:29] <Tach> __adrian why would SCP be better otherwise then getting it from a repo or so ?
[20:12:43] <__adrian> i didn't say it would. i said "or whatever."
[20:13:01] <__adrian> par tof your setup work here is to put your script on the server you want to run it on
[20:13:20] <Tach> __adrian the prestep is part of what will be done through PHP
[20:13:50] <Tach> __adrian you said [17:40:00] <__adrian> and no, don't do anything you said there
[20:13:54] <__adrian> no; that's a bad approach.
[20:14:07] <__adrian> php should absolutely not be writing new php scripts on demand.
[20:14:58] <__adrian> write the script you want to run, taking the args you will need, put it on your server. this is all setup ("install") work. you don't do this work at runtime.

[20:16:26] <Tach> __adrian write it ? it curls it in, I didn't say anything about writing it
[20:16:54] <__adrian> you're wanting to use curl to grab a script from somewhere else and then run it?
[20:17:04] <__adrian> why would you want to do this?
[20:17:15] <__adrian> it's a very vulnerable approach.
[20:18:10] <Tach> __adrian and why would that be ?
[20:18:16] <__adrian> ...
[20:18:29] <Tach> you say it is so you should be able to explain it
[20:19:49] <__adrian> i'm trying to understand your use case, here. there's plenty of readily available advice on why downloading scripts and running them is not a great idea; i will leave that to your research
[20:20:04] <__adrian> why are you opposed to installing the script on your server?
[20:20:52] <Tach> __adrian if you say so, maybe you need to explain that to every major software that is installed, every software you install is downloaded at the end

[20:23:11] <Tach> __adrian very well explained
[20:23:16] <__adrian> i.e., is that an actual problem? or just something to argue about?
[20:23:24] <Tach> __adrian what do you call "installing" ?
