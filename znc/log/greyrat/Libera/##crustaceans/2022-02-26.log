[01:18:53] <gerikson> well well well this Ukraine invasion has sure turned up some cockroaches in the ole Gemlog feed
[01:22:01] <gwozniak> sounds like fun
[01:22:12] <gwozniak> What are the cockroaches on about?
[01:35:23] <gerikson> well, basically Biden goaded Putin to invade Ukraine
[01:35:29] <gerikson> he just couldn't help himself!
[01:35:35] <gerikson> Biden insulted him!
[01:35:53] <gerikson> these people seem like Bernie dead-enders
[01:36:34] <river> so really biden caused the war
[01:37:04] <gerikson> yes
[01:37:17] <gerikson> you see, Vladimir is very simple
[01:37:25] <gerikson> you insult him, he lashes out
[01:37:31] <gerikson> Trump was much better!
[01:37:41] <gerikson> he understood Vladimir
[01:40:37] <gwozniak> of course
[01:41:30] <gerikson> hmm peace talks?
[01:41:32] <gerikson> hope so
[01:41:39] <gerikson> pretty sure the terms will be very harsh
[01:42:19] <gwozniak> "Surrender the territory we want and we'll go away. Except in those territories."
[01:45:57] <river> trump was secretly controlled by putin somehow

[17:00:47] <river> he is a total idiot
[17:00:59] <river> nooo dont ban ad-ware and nag boxes, what if they ban racists next?
[17:03:23] <gerikson> 10:27 < Hail_Spacecake> I actually do think that lots of internet cultural spaces have suffered from internet useage having become completely mainstream in much of the world
[17:03:26] <gerikson> 10:28 < Hail_Spacecake> I blame feminism though
[17:06:31] <gerikson> 03:29 < Hail_Spacecake> manicennui: actually a lot of the reason I care about things deemed white supremacist is becuase I think they constitute unfair attacks on white people
[17:09:39] <river> remember for years he had this Thing where he flat out refused to join the offtopic channel
[17:10:12] <river> id rather the conversation die, than move it to a more relevant channel kind of thing
[17:24:12] <ngoldbaum> wait did he get unbanned or are those old logs gerikson?

[17:38:35] <gerikson> I have a bunch of quotes

[21:37:01] <prussian> Reminds me that the military actually uses tracers in combat in 2022
[21:37:08] <prussian> Lol
[21:39:48] <Brekkjern> Various countries have different doctrines, but it's common for weapons where you walk the shots in
[21:40:04] <Brekkjern> Another strategy is that the bottom of the magazine contains tracers so you know you are almost out
[21:42:11] <prussian> all this "tech" though
[21:42:28] <prussian> and we still need/want to tell everyone where our shit is going
[21:43:09] <prussian> I remember as a kid playing Aces High II, turning tracers off because I didn't need them to aim and I didn't want the person I was shooting to see anything.
[21:43:22] <Brekkjern> Well, depends a bit. Tracer rounds are not very visible as they are coming towards you. The flare is on the rear of the bullet so you need to be behind it to see it.
[21:43:42] <Brekkjern> So it's commonly used to walk your shots in by aiming with the tracers if you are using something with a big ammo feed
[21:46:25] <gerikson> prussian: why would tracer rounds be obsolete?

[21:52:42] <kline> 18:13 <prussian> I remember as a kid playing Aces High II, turning tracers off because I didn't need them to aim and I didn't want the person I was shooting to see anything.
[21:52:52] <kline> thank you for explaining your strategic background
[21:54:45] <kline> remember that modern tracer rounds dont start glowing for a few hundred feet to minimise the ease of back tracking, and they use glow compounds in the base of the round so that they are most visible from the read and least visible from the front
[21:55:49] <kline> the value of tracer rounds vs their (mitigated) risks are generally still positive
[21:55:58] <prussian> strong doubt
[21:56:20] <kline> look, i know youre called "prussian" but you're no clausewitz
[21:56:21] <prussian> still a vis risk
[21:57:09] <kline> tracer rounds are still routinely used with varying mitigations a lot of the time. theyre issued as standard because on the whole they are a net positive
[21:57:12] <ngoldbaum> bkero: no thank you
[21:57:31] <Brekkjern> Visibility is irrelevant if everyone knows where everyone are, which is a common scenario in grand war, which most militaries in eastern Europe see as a very likely scenario

[22:46:22] <imode> freenode then.
[22:47:28] <kline> gerikson, one of the best things to come out of this, isolating from the war bit, is the number of incredibly dumb takes people cant help but spaff all over the internet
[22:48:57] <gerikson> oh yeah
[22:49:40] <gerikson> I think H_S got tired of being ratiod on IRC
[22:49:47] <gerikson> his comments on the site are sometimes ok
[22:54:15] <gerikson> ``The New Yorker articles always feel like I'm reading a very expensive blogpost from a new college graduate. Some opinion on a topic is repeatedly characterized as fact, just because they have a lot of facts on hand.''
[22:56:15] <gerikson> ``The biggest disappointment here is that even the respected New Yorker is now a card carrying member of the elites' shameless propaganda machine.''
[22:56:18] <gerikson> LOL
[22:56:25] <gerikson> the New Yorker *is* elist
[22:58:25] <kline> most big brand journalism is like this now
[22:59:31] <kline> in the world, in general, there is too much mid- and high-level hiring and not enough promotion from within
[22:59:51] <gerikson> I only read John McPhee from the New Yorker
[22:59:59] <kline> no new yorker journos without first 10 years of local journalism please
[23:02:10] <gerikson> not gonna happen
[23:02:13] <gerikson> :D
[23:04:27] <kline> i know
[23:04:33] <kline> same with management
[23:04:40] <kline> no managers without domain experience
[23:05:26] <Brekkjern> Just gotta make sure you promote the worst managers from the ones with domain experience
[23:05:34] <gerikson> the NY is a bit of a weird beast tho
[23:06:00] <gerikson> it's been years since I read it but I remember it being quite specifically local
[23:06:09] <gerikson> liek a big chunk was about local NYC things
[23:22:59] <ngoldbaum> imode: he hung out in here and in #lobsters over on libera, he got banned here then there in like 2018 for being an insufferable twat

[23:23:21] <ngoldbaum> gerikson has deep logs game
[23:25:10] <gerikson> no doubt he is on Urbit, planning to hunt everyone in this channel for sport once Bitcoin conquers all
[23:30:09] <imode> urbit is still a fucking thing?
[23:30:47] <gerikson> don't know, don't care
[23:34:44] <river> yeah  jon blow just gave a talk at some urbit conf recently
[23:36:05] <imode> fucking seriously?
[23:36:26] <gerikson> really?!
[23:36:37] <river> yeah
[23:36:37] <gerikson> wow , he fell even further in respect
[23:36:50] <imode> why did he even have any respect in the first place.
[23:36:52] <river> i've heard him criticized a lot but i actually thought he was better than this
[23:37:12] <imode> he made two sub-par games and blogged about a programming language.
[23:37:16] <imode> that's not noteworthy.
[23:37:59] <river> and casey is doing regular talks about bitcoin
[23:38:04] <river> on twitc
[23:38:52] <gerikson> who is Casey?
[23:39:19] <river> he wrote the walking in the witness
[23:39:34] <imode> casey muratori.
[23:39:38] <gerikson> ah ok
[23:39:56] <river> he was doing that handmade hero series
[23:39:56] <imode> otherwise known as "subpar game programmer #2"
[23:39:59] <river> about how to make a video game frmo scratch
[23:40:06] <river> built a big audience and pivoted to blockchain talks
[23:40:25] <imode> not even considering that a majority of that series was "how do I overcomplicate game programming"
[23:41:03] <river> i thought there was a lot of value in that, but i also used to think suckless was doing a good thing
[23:43:07] <imode> you can become a thought leader really easily if you're a programmer and have an inflated projection of your self-worth that you can sell.
[23:43:38] <imode> it's cheap and you just need to know a bare minimum of programming and some math.
[23:50:14] <companion_cube> imode: I don't think casey or jon blow are bad game programmers
[23:50:24] <companion_cube> all the imgui stuff is good
[23:50:40] <companion_cube> but it doesn't mean they have good opinions on everything else
[23:51:29] <river> they are/were very good programmrs
[23:51:44] <companion_cube> otoh Jai is a fucking joke
[23:51:51] <river> im not gonna shit on jai
[23:51:54] <river> its ugly and not my thing
[23:52:03] <companion_cube> its development being closed means it's a joke, sorry :p
[23:52:14] <river> but he's put a lot of work into it and it' scool to make a hobby programming language
[23:52:19] <companion_cube> there's an open source clone, odin
[23:52:26] <companion_cube> emphasis on "hobby" yeah
[23:52:33] <companion_cube> just like our favorite ddevault :D
[23:53:25] <imode> companion_cube: subpar != bad fwiw.
[23:53:41] <imode> they are below the expectations that can be inferred from their projected image.
[23:53:44] <companion_cube> hum
[23:53:48] <companion_cube> oh interesting.
[23:53:57] <companion_cube> but then probably everyone famous is subpar
[23:54:05] <companion_cube> even fucking bellard :D
[23:54:06] <imode> somewhat.
