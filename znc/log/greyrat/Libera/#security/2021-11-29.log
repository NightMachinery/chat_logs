[05:36:51] <Hash> In the movie Oceans Twelve (2nd one in the series), they shot a computer hacker arrow
[05:37:08] <Hash> they got the thing to unlock the case and have access to the server
[05:37:26] <Hash> But if the server was protected with encryption and keys and keys were stored elsewhere, they woudln't be able to do anything
[05:37:30] <Hash> the thieves I mean
[05:38:03] <Hash> yeah well keys are usually in your rsa keys which is in your .ssh directory on local pc yes
[05:38:20] <asdfa> pff
[05:38:23] <Hash> If anyone get on your pc when you are logged in and away from pc, and they can copy you rkeys
[05:38:24] <asdfa> hahahaha

[05:38:54] <Hash> People usualy use that keypair from ~/.ssh to encrypt things using pgp and stuff
[05:39:00] <Hash> and it all liveson their computer
[05:39:06] <Hash> As do the encrypted drives
[05:39:10] <asdfa> nope, i meant the scenario i wasn't at home
[05:39:15] <Hash> So what's the piont of encryption then?
[05:39:20] <Hash> See whaI mean?
[05:39:31] <Hash> Keys should be imported from external device for maximum security
[05:39:37] <Hash> like usb or ubi key
[05:39:50] <Hash> don't store key son the same PC as the encrypted hard drives
[05:39:56] <Hash> this defeats the purpose
[05:40:05] <Hash> or password protect your keys
[05:40:16] <Hash> and instead of using a password, use a long passphrase
[05:40:36] <Hash> such as Hash is the most awesome person in the all the multiverses.
[05:41:01] <Hash> such as "Hash is the most awesome person in the all the multiverses!" the whole thing could be your password. OR use the firs tletter from each word in the sentence.
[05:41:05] <Hash> stop using passwords.
[05:41:28] <Hash> Or use a 3d party pw generator and keep like keeppassXc or something
[05:42:27] <ajak> people use ssh keys for pgp?
[05:42:33] <ajak> that sounds wrong at best
[05:43:11] <asdfa> lmfao
[05:43:40] <Hash> I use keepass and lastfm and abine blur
[05:43:43] <Hash> 3 things
[05:43:54] <asdfa> the scenario like they can remove the disk and decrypt it in another machine
[05:44:07] <asdfa> how to prevent that?
[05:44:19] <Hash> use a diff keypair to encrypt a disk
[05:44:27] <asdfa> (without spending money)
[05:44:31] <Hash> dif keypair than what lives in ~/.ssh
[05:45:09] <Hash> or store your symmetric AES key off site, not on the same pc.
[05:45:50] <ajak> or use a secret from your head
[05:47:14] <Hydragyrum> I use passphrase + external keyfile for encrypted stuff usually

[09:48:40] <namkeleser> Hey I have a bit of a stupid question to ask about r75.46, so I have changed the password via the "set user admin password" command. which works fine for ssh termnal. but it doesnt change the password for the smartdashboard. i have read that you can it by bringing up cpconfig.deleting the admin account, and recreating it with a new password. but
[09:48:41] <namkeleser> sounds a bit wrong to me. if i try to do it from the dashboard itself, it says user can only be managed by cpconfig

[22:16:11] <fpombal> well, I ended up brute-forcing the problem by adding the Google account to an emulated Android device with Android Studio. Turns out Google still allows setting up traditional TOTP codes-based 2FA, but _after_ setting up the account on an (emulated) Android device to receive the sign-in prompts. Once set up, the 2FA with TOTP codes will still work correctly even after signing out of the account
[22:16:13] <fpombal> on the (emulated) device, which can then be deleted. What an absolute mess of asshole design. Fucking Google.

[23:43:04] <Apachez> commercialism
[23:43:46] <Apachez> so what do you prefer as load-interval for an interface?
[23:43:50] <topside> I think 95% of the time "pgp" is used, it is not implementation-specific :P
