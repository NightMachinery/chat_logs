[09:55:08] <Robomot> In Defense of Attempting Hard Things [] (and my story of the Leverage ecosystem)
[09:55:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is some shit :|
[09:57:34] * ardent[m] pops in
[09:57:35] <ardent[m]> >so, you got wreamed long and hard in the other channels?
[09:58:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think we attempted something that was brave and commendable, while also being novel and very hard to parse from the outside. It was high-risk, high-reward, and while I generally endorse the enormous amount of effort we put into trying to make the project work, my lived experience was often somewhere between painful and horrifying." ... and then you still think it was a good thing?!
[09:58:52] <ardent[m]> is this what catgirl AI does to a person? (if so, where do I sign up)
[09:59:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I’ll offer some possible explanations for why the environment was so bad for me, but whatever the cause, the result was that I was largely crippled by the time the project wound down. Two and a half years after leaving, I’d say I’ve done a lot of healing and I’ve also been able to adapt my life to accommodate the various ways in which I still struggle. Despite all this, as you’ll see from my writing below, I still
[09:59:01] <Obormot\Arcturus>  think it makes sense to try difficult things." ... good god
[10:00:01] <ggreer> https://courses.lumenlearning.com/microbiology/chapter/polyclonal-and-monoclonal-antibody-production/
[10:00:02] <Robomot> Polyclonal and Monoclonal Antibody Production | Microbiology
[10:00:13] <ggreer> > mAbs are produced by immunizing an animal, often a mouse, multiple times with a specific antigen. B cells from the spleen of the immunized animal are then removed. Since normal B cells are unable to proliferate forever, they are fused with immortal, cancerous B cells called myeloma cells, to yield hybridoma cells.
[10:00:18] <ggreer> ok now you're just fucking with me
[10:03:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When I first encountered the group, it was clear that something different was going on. They were pretty much crap at any of the conservation behaviors that in my circles meant that you cared about improving the state of the world: they didn’t recycle, they’d turn on the kitchen sink and then walk away to go get something, they’d hold the fridge door wide open while they tried to carefully answer a question about the
[10:03:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  limited types of goals they’d seen in people’s motivational setups -- I don’t even know if they were registered to vote!" ... lol. She then goes on to say something like "but actually this is fine, this just meant that they weren't deceiving themselves that separating paper and plastic was gonna solve climate change or w/e, they were serious about their goals". Fine and well, I agree! But then:
[10:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "(And just so the conservationists don’t spend the rest of this post cringing, or worrying that these were signs of being uncaring or self-important: when those early individuals found out that their behaviors gave this Californian goosebumps, they were perfectly happy to pay attention to saving water or electricity, not just as a show in front of me, but generally, whether or not I was around.)" ... so they weren't serious
[10:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  after all? wtf?
[10:05:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't try to save water or electricity. (My water is unmetered, and... well, with LED bulbs, even if I were to leave all my lights on all the time it would affect my electric bill by some insignificant amount, so I don't bother.) If some granola-chick Californian was like "oh no why aren't you saving water :( " I would tell her to fuck off
[10:06:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> *Maybe* if I liked her personally I'd first gently explain that this kind of shit doesn't fucking matter at all.
[10:07:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who are these "conservationists" who would spend the rest of the post cringing? Are they just, like, idiot normies? Does she not know that this kind of thing doesn't matter? This is such a weird perspective
[10:09:39] <ardent[m]> yeah and leaving a faucet running is way less usage than watering a lawn at the wrong time of day
[10:10:01] <ardent[m]> (or choosing the wrong plants for the region, as well)
[10:10:37] <ardent[m]> it's just far more visibly wasteful and thus by keeping it on you aren't properly sacrificing your executive function to the Gods
[10:13:24] <saturn2> she does seem pretty clear that it's a Californist religious ritual
[10:15:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, but why did these people go along with it??
[10:16:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I'm like 10-15% of the way through and it's already blatantly obvious that this whole thing was a terrible idea that would go absolutely nowhere *at best*, and it absolutely boggles my mind that this woman couldn't *and somehow STILL CAN'T* see that
[10:17:09] <saturn2> weren't they also believing in literal demonic posession? this seems a bit tame in comparison
[10:18:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't gotten to that part yet
[10:19:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> The paragraph that starts "Initially Leverage was just a small nonprofit with very limited funding", and the ~5 grafs after, are hilarious
[10:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like... they didn't hire people for having any kind of useful skill at anything. Nobody they hired had the slightest interest in contributing actually running the organization in any practical sense, nor did the people in charge try to remedy that fact. They *reluctantly* hired this Cathleen person because she wasn't completely useless, unlike everyone else there (though it was a lower-status position because "getting
[10:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  shit done and keeping the organization operating at all" is not as cool as "spending all your time thinking abstractly about grand cosmic problems"), and once there, she ended up doing everything, because nobody else wanted to do anything.
[10:24:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Reading about their housing logistics problems is also hilarious)
[10:25:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Group houses, man. They really are the absolute worst)
[10:25:24] <PapuaHardyNet> really? there's a culture of group houses in the EA community
[10:25:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if I should take it as a red flag if someone I talk to mentions they live in a group house, when they are rat-adjacent
[10:26:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Yes there is and yes you should
[10:26:26] <saturn2> some of them, i assume, are good people
[10:26:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> You 100% should take it as a red flag
[10:28:05] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, it's high-variance; OTOH, my personal priors on it so far has been... not great; specifically, many selection effects that goes into getting into those houses are whether someone aligns heavily with group-thinking, which in EA/rat-adjecent circles creates some very cringe behavior
[10:28:31] <SDr> so, yellow-ish flag
[10:29:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> See, even SDr thinks it's a flag
[10:29:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> That makes it a *double* flag
[10:29:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it's probably, like, microwave colored
[10:29:53] <superz> lol
[10:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> If not in fact AM radio
[10:30:08] <saturn2> if that's yellow-ish, what would be a full red flag
[10:30:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Full blown psychosis, I guess
[10:31:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Red flag. Not for sure bad! But red flag.
[10:31:17] <saturn2> lol
[10:32:02] <PapuaHardyNet> SDr: impressive. I wonder how you would learn to build such a group around you, by finding people who like group-thinking and want to be part of groups
[10:32:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol @ these anecdotes about people in their group house not washing their dirty linens or taking out the trash
[10:32:37] <PapuaHardyNet> ugh, how can you be EA when you can't take out the trash
[10:32:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In a general pursuit of learning more about effectiveness (with the basic idea that for the huge problems society faces, we’ll need a lot of benevolent, motivated people who are more effective than the average Joe), we experimented with all sorts of things not strictly limited to psychology." ... but did you ever consider that you might need people who can take care of basic adult tasks
[10:33:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds like these fuckers were all *much, much less effective* than the average Joe
[10:33:50] <saturn2> did you ever experiment with...... cleaning your room
[10:34:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jordan Peterson really was right
[10:36:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think by the start of year two, even before I was an official member of the team, it was taking a pretty serious toll on me — I have various ideas about why it was such a difficult environment for someone like me in particular." ... this is some truly titanic cognitive dissonance here
[10:37:45] <PapuaHardyNet> so I am part of this group of young EAs (18-25)
[10:37:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> She's absolutely refusing to admit to herself that shit was bad for her because she was like the only remotely sane/competent person trying to support a gaggle of useless babies
[10:38:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I can already see the signs of obvious failure modes
[10:38:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And was vastly underappreciated and underpaid
[10:38:42] <PapuaHardyNet> like this girl is stressed out about long term issues like AI Safety, AI policy, "Biosecurity", et cetera
[10:39:04] <PapuaHardyNet> she worries she would waste her life on something "useless" and fail to contribute to these fields
[10:39:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For whatever reason, we ended up recruiting very few people who I would consider particularly conscientious and who shared my more practical/less abstract worldview and areas of expertise (and resulting concerns)." ... mm yes hm very strange, yes
[10:40:19] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I can understand the reasoning - especially when your *entire social group* is all about this field
[10:40:40] <saturn2> for the huge problems society faces, we'll need a lot of adult babies and volunteer moms to look after them
[10:40:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Tell all these people that step 1 is to go get tested for anxiety disorders and start taking anxiolytics
[10:41:12] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot, do you think these EA orgs are usually very... religious in nature? That's the best word I can use to describe it
[10:41:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: At least half of EA is actually just untreated anxiety disorders
[10:41:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes they're often religious
[10:41:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I need a volunteer mom
[10:41:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> !wp scrupulosity
[10:41:32] <Robomot> Obormot\Arcturus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity
[10:41:32] <Robomot> Scrupulosity is characterized by pathological guilt/anxiety about moral or religious issues. It is more commonly known as religious anxiety. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning. It has not been proven to be an actual disorder by medical professionals, though it falls under the anxiety category 
[10:42:07] <catern> this is dangerously sneer-y
[10:42:07] <PapuaHardyNet> ooh I had no idea this is an actual concept in psychology
[10:42:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: This is not a new spontaneous observation, I have been saying this specific thing for literal years now, based on even more years of watching the EA / rationalist movements
[10:43:05] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: I for one am not sneering, I can think through a usual EA thought process, and have EA friends. Obormot *is* sneering at Leverage Research, but we can allow that
[10:43:21] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: i know, but i still say this is dangerously sneer-y
[10:43:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Are you referring to my comments to PapuaHardyNet or my comments about the Leverage thing
[10:43:38] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: ya I just meant Obormot
[10:43:52] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: the leverage thing
[10:43:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh ok
[10:44:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> In that case I am 100% fine with it.
[10:44:17] <saturn2> what's the danger?
[10:44:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> They deserve to be mocked.
[10:44:33] <catern> saturn2: hypocrisy
[10:44:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm going to compile all obormot rants and release a small 500k word book called "Why Leverage Sucks, by Obormot"
[10:44:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> EAs, I don't think are bad people, mostly
[10:44:56] <PapuaHardyNet> we'll market it on lesswrong, make them buy hardcover copies
[10:45:04] <superz> lol
[10:45:05] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: "They deserve to be mocked." - whatever the phase beyond "dangerously sneery", you've now entered it with that comment
[10:45:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Eh. The stuff on LW already is way spicier than anything I have to say
[10:45:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I will unhesitatingly stand by the position that some people and/or things deserve to be mocked
[10:45:44] <pompolic> mots de obormot
[10:45:51] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with catern btw - I try my best *not* to sneer at people
[10:45:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: In fact I'd say that the view that *nobody* should be mocked is way *more* dangerous
[10:46:02] <ardent[m]> My issue with EA is in the shift away from earning-to-give towards something very qualitatively different
[10:46:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: Oh? Could you say more about that
[10:46:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> ?
[10:46:48] <ardent[m]> a lot more career advice kinds of things, claiming not to be money-limited, etc
[10:46:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm interesting
[10:47:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not unpredictable, of course
[10:47:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's part of EA's mainstreaming
[10:47:21] <saturn2> catern: i don't think opposing sneerclub means you have to give up ever sneering
[10:47:22] <ardent[m]> and my response to that is you may not be money limited in a world where you rely on free labor to give out malaria nets... but instead maybe the costs have just gone up since you now have to hire people
[10:47:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Among normal people, charity is mostly about signaling
[10:47:46] <ardent[m]> and switching instead to "people should work on AI risk" sounds very fishy
[10:47:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which means that there's a limit on how much traction "earning to give" can ever get in the mainstream
[10:48:02] <catern> saturn2: i think it will be better for you as a person though
[10:48:10] <ardent[m]> instead of "yeah now it costs 3x more to save a life because the low hanging fruit is gone"
[10:48:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's weird and seems very "commodifying altruism"
[10:48:17] *** Parts: la_mettrie (~rimrunner@2a01:4f9:c010:3051::1) (WeeChat 2.7.1)
[10:48:25] <ardent[m]> (the low hanging fruit being gone is a good thing)
[10:48:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That it's *effective* is of course nigh-irrelevant for signaling purposes
[10:48:43] <saturn2> catern: i see
[10:48:54] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: I agree! also, by not sneering you are just more relaxed to be around with
[10:49:03] <ardent[m]> there's also the issue that you can decide to give 1/10 as much, you can't decide to career 1/10 as much
[10:49:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: If I can't sneer at all then sneerclub has won
[10:49:19] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: indeed, indeed
[10:49:22] <ardent[m]> so there's no way to do it halfway-there if it's about fields rather than donations
[10:49:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: A valid point
[10:50:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: You say we shouldn't sneer; do you also say that we shouldn't mock? Do you say that we shouldn't judge?
[10:50:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it permissible to say that something is bad, at all?
[10:50:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can we evaluate things in any way?
[10:51:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (These are not rhetorical questions, I want to know where the line is, according to you)
[10:51:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And what it divides from what)
[10:51:14] <catern> exactly Obormot we should never evaluate things or say they are bad, obviously that's what I'm saying
[10:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I expect it's not, but then what *are* you saying? This is my question
[10:51:50] <catern> I just demonstrated my view on the appropriate line by example :)
[10:52:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get it
[10:52:20] <catern> (well that was mockery or at least sarcasm)
[10:52:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, and thus? What?
[10:52:48] <catern> okay, fine - yes we should say be able to evaluate and say things are bad
[10:53:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, and where is the line between "saying things are bad" and "mocking things"?
[10:53:11] <catern> there is an ineffable (and fairly wide) line between that and sneering at them which I will not define
[10:53:18] <catern> but I know it when I see it
[10:53:25] <saturn2> my guess: it's okay to sneer at things that annoy catern but it's bad to sneer at everything else
[10:53:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kinda sounds like it's ... shit, saturn2 beat me to it
[10:54:02] <PapuaHardyNet> "I know it when I see it" hell yea
[10:54:09] <catern> sneering imperils your soul
[10:54:23] <PapuaHardyNet> catern, mate, just leave it be, there's no use fighting this battle
[10:54:25] <catern> and also your social and economic life by making you more likely to be insufferable
[10:54:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it possible for opposition to sneering to render one insufferable?
[10:54:54] <catern> yes
[10:55:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[10:55:09] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: true true

[11:22:16] <feep> I like a definition I came up on reddit
[11:23:05] <feep> there was an article about a programming thing that got a bit heated about bad design decisions, and somebody in the reddit post was like, "was this necessary" and the standard I came up with to decide whether it was hostile was

[11:24:49] <feep> I don't know how to apply it, but I think it generalizes to community sentiment that may be detectable
[11:25:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if the thing people were [sneering/criticizing] was a post the maintainer had written explaining why they did stuff they did
[11:25:18] <feep> again, let them come into the space
[11:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then?
[11:25:27] <feep> let them argue their piece
[11:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then?
[11:25:39] <feep> measure the response
[11:25:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get it
[11:25:47] <feep> do they get excluded
[11:25:52] <feep> do they get laughed at
[11:25:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Excluded how
[11:25:57] <feep> or do they get interacted with
[11:26:02] <feep> as a normal member of the space
[11:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if they're doing laughable things?
[11:26:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that impossible?
[11:26:17] <feep> there's a difference between laughing at things and laughing at people
[11:26:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok...
[11:26:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the difference?
[11:26:34] <feep> ...? the target?
[11:26:34] <saturn2> that's an interesting question, what *should* we do if leverage people came here?
[11:26:46] <feep> lol obormot is so dumb
[11:26:52] <feep> lol obormot's library is so dumb
[11:26:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Nothing in particular? I mean, "do" about what
[11:26:59] <feep> those are different statements!

[11:27:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Sure but what if I'm like "here's why I made my library this way"
[11:27:21] <feep> as I said in that reddit convo, I have written a lot of code that was very, very shit
[11:27:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes yes this is all fine but also irrelevant
[11:27:48] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: right, then I think that should be upvoted
[11:28:01] *** Joins: x88x88x (~x88x88x@149.28.53.172)
[11:28:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not the point I am making
[11:28:04] <feep> or like, positively interacted with
[11:28:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Positively how?
[11:28:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if my reasons are bad? Are people allowed to say that? Or is that sneering
[11:28:25] <feep> thing-focusedly, or topic-focusedly
[11:28:29] <feep> sure they are
[11:28:35] <feep> that's still focused on the thing
[11:28:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, what if my reasons are bad and all my arguments are bad and everything I say is dumb *and* also hostile?
[11:29:00] <feep> huh? that seems overdetermined
[11:29:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it does, so then what
[11:29:16] <feep> like, sure, if you behave like a shit you'll get excluded, the point was that the deter--
[11:29:20] <feep> oh, I never made that clear
[11:29:28] <feep> I think what's informative is the *initial* response.
[11:29:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> What counts as an "initial" response?
[11:30:04] <feep> no fixed answer
[11:30:20] <feep> if your first comment is an ascii post of a swastika, "initial" will be a very short phase :p
[11:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, your criterion for discerning sneering is "there is no criterion, actually"
[11:30:37] <feep> there is a criterion, it's just hard to formalized
[11:30:41] <feep> formalize
[11:31:00] <feep> I'm trying to explain a classifier in my brain, and you keep diverting into other classifiers
[11:31:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it at all applicable to any situation other than the one where a person who made a thing that a subreddit is mocking comes to that subreddit to discuss it?
[11:31:19] <feep> I think it generalizes.
[11:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, how?
[11:31:28] <feep> it just doesn't perfectly generalize to every situation
[11:31:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough, what are its limits?
[11:31:50] <feep> so like, yes granted if you behave like a total shit on your first contact the "initial phase" will be very short
[11:31:55] <feep> so assume you act reasonably polite
[11:32:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> No no, that's trivial
[11:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's instead ask a more relevant question
[11:32:16] <feep> like yes I agree
[11:32:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if we're mocking some app and the author of that app never, ever comes into this channel
[11:32:34] <feep> I think there's a determining factor of "how dare you defend yourself"
[11:32:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it possible to discover whether we are sneering at him?
[11:32:55] <feep> .... hm. I'm actually not sure. tending no.
[11:33:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That doesn't seem like a very useful classifier.
[11:33:10] <feep> or rather, I think there's a continuum between sneering and criticism
[11:33:21] <feep> and the interesting question is more how the social system reacts on contact
[11:33:43] <catern> we need a prediction market on what would happen if they came into the channel
[11:33:46] <feep> ie. does it leave sneering mode and correct to adapt to that person now being present in the peergroup
[11:33:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think that's *an* interesting question but not *the* interesting question
[11:34:05] <feep> or does it hunker down and try to exclude the person
[11:34:05] <catern> resolved periodically by paying a fraction of the targets to come to the channel
[11:34:18] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I think sneering is valuable to some extent, ere it harm none.
[11:34:28] <catern> (then we can discover whether we are sneering without them actually coming into the channel)
[11:34:30] <feep> it can be used to harden community norms against bad practices
[11:35:15] <feep> like
[11:35:25] <feep> the lesswrong sequences are at least 5% sneering by volume
[11:35:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Because, like, you're positing this scenario where people are criticizing some thing that they *lack critical information about*, and then asking "aha but what if they *get* that information!", and using their (possibly only hypothetical, possibly actual) reaction to judge whether their mode of criticism, their stance, is healthy or not
[11:35:38] <feep> yeah exactly
[11:36:05] <feep> well, almost
[11:36:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: This is all well and good, but it seems to be entirely useless in situations where people have the relevant information at their disposal and *then* are criticizing the thing in question *anyway*, from a position of *already* knowing everything relevant about it
[11:36:33] <feep> I don't think it's "what if they get that information", I think it's in general about how they respond to attempts to defend that position or increase the detail level of the map in that area
[11:36:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, yes, but that's just a variant of the same thing
[11:36:51] <feep> I don't think so
[11:37:05] <feep> that can also happen in situations where people hold wrong, but complete, beliefs
[11:37:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, but what if they are *right* and complete beliefs?
[11:37:22] <feep> um
[11:37:51] <feep> I submit that if your scenario is "what if people know everything and are right about everything" you are no longer talking about anything relevant to reality.
[11:38:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think so, because it's not "everything", but only "everything relevant about a specific thing"
[11:38:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's very realistic and common
[11:38:16] <feep> I think that still holds.
[11:38:24] <feep> I don't think that happens almost ever.
[11:38:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> It happens all the time
[11:38:40] <feep> weeeeell that seems like a more fundamental disagreement
[11:38:50] <feep> that tbh explains a lot about our argumentative differences :D
[11:38:56] <feep> but I must afk hike.
[11:38:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question is: if I know all about a thing, can I sneer at it? By which I mean: is it *possible*, under your definition of "sneer", for me to ever be sneering at that thing? And if so, is it permissible for me to sneer at it?
[11:39:15] <feep> permissible is the exactly important question, imo.
[11:39:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, but what about possible?
[11:39:32] * feep flees tho! will respond later! hike!
[11:40:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does the definition permit it? Because if the definition requires "how do you respond to new information about it" to discern sneering, then it obviously can't ever be applied when all the info is already at hand!
[11:40:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fact is that the following situation is very common:
[11:41:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone publishes some message or document where they explain why they did some stuff, made a thing (and/or made it the way they did), etc.
[11:41:17] *** Quits: schmudde (~schmudde@216.169.6.249) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:42:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's explicitly their "here is the info you need to judge my thing; here's my explanation of why I did what I did; here are my reasons, here is my motivation, here is why I made each decision, etc."
[11:42:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems nonsensical to evaluate people's response to that by asking "ah but what would they say if they found out more information about it!'
[11:43:33] <PapuaHardyNet> feep agrees with you, he just is too shy to admit it right now
[11:43:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> What would they say if they found out more information about it? Well, the thing they're saying now, already, because they just *did* find out more information about - they just found out all the relevant things! On account of a specific effort by the author of the thing to provide those things!
[11:44:22] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right
[11:45:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, let's say I write an app, and then I write a blog post detailing my reasons for making that app how I made it. If someone uses the app, reads the post, then mocks me, what good is it for me to say "well to know if they're sneering at me, I have to know how they'd react if they learned why I did it this way"? I already do know, because they already *are* reacting to learning why I did it this way, because I put it in my
[11:45:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  blog post, which I wrote for that express purpose
[11:46:13] <saturn2> feep's heuristic seems okay to me under the narrow conditions where it would apply
[11:46:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: They are *very* narrow conditions, though...
[11:46:32] <saturn2> yes
[11:46:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it doesn't even seem ok to me then, tbh
[11:47:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, consider this scenario, consisting of characters Developer and Critic:
[11:47:53] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic (to friends): Have you heard of app X that Developer made? Isn't it dumb? Here's why it's dumb, and bad, and wrong: <some criticism>
[11:48:25] <Obormot\Gaia> Developer, appearing in a puff of smoke: Ah, but wouldn't you like to hear why I made app X that way? I assure you, I have my reasons!
[11:48:35] <saturn2> the bad thing is seeking out things to sneer at, or reasons to sneer at things, in order to glorify oneself
[11:48:37] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic: No doubt. Well, tell us, sure.
[11:48:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Developer: My reasons were A, B, and C.
[11:49:40] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic: Fair enough. That makes sense, yes. A, B, and C would indeed plausibly lead you to make app X like you did.
[11:49:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Developer: So, you no longer think app X is dumb, and bad, and wrong?
[11:50:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic: I do still think that, actually. All of my original criticisms still apply, and are entirely unaffected by anything you say. Also, A, B, and C are all very stupid ideas, and are wrong. Here's why: <more criticism>
[11:51:23] <pompolic> i wonder if feep's thing distills into: "is the community doing the thing where <<it's a witch if she floats, it's a witch if she drowns>>"?
[11:51:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic: In summary, I still think that app X is bad, and dumb, and wrong.

[11:52:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this scenario, the Developer has come in, been greeted politely, allowed to explain himself, *and then his explanations are judged to be stupid*
[11:53:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Critic has learned all the relevant facts (such as they are), and the criticism stands unchanged
[11:53:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (In fact the Critic likely now also thinks that the Developer himself is dumb in general, though it may be impolite to say it "to his face", as it were)
[11:53:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is it possible to use any of this to determine whether sneering is happening?
[11:54:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if instead of a dynamic interaction, the reasons in question were just laid out in a blog post?
[11:55:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I write a post that goes into excruciating detail about why I did something a certain way, going all the way down to foundational beliefs about reality and my emotional attachments and aesthetic preferences and ideological commitments, etc., and after reading it you think that I'm an idiot and my reasons for doing things are dumb and my decisions are wrong and my work is bad, then what?
[11:56:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, bottom line, I agree with saturn2 re: "the bad thing is..."
[11:58:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep's view seems heavily "mistake theoretic", along the lines of "bad things are actually not bad, only misunderstood" (this is clearly a caricature of his actual views, but I can't at all tell to what extent it is a caricature...)

[12:40:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah
[12:41:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> When I tried to use one piece of Robomot functionality, I discovered three bugs at once
[12:41:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> One bug was due to a logic error in my string manipulation code - fixed.
[12:42:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> One bug was due to needing a workaround for a buggy text encoding recognizer in an obscure Cocoa API - fixed.
[12:42:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> And one bug ... turned out to be a bug in the IRC client I use.
[12:42:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not fixed, not fixable, ever.
[12:44:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wish the author would release the source. He's already given the app away... what can possibly be in there that he cares about keeping closed?
[12:44:45] <pie_> how hard would the bug be to binary patch
[12:45:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... I can't even imagine
[12:45:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's nowhere near important enough to try
[12:45:58] <PapuaHardyNet> did you call the author and ask him?
[12:46:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I very much doubt he will say no to your face
[12:46:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Any smallest iota of effort I might spend on such a thing would in any case be vastly better applied to work on my own IRC client
[12:46:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: ... to releasing the source? Why wouldn't he say no?
[12:47:10] <PapuaHardyNet> ? either you don't consider yourself very persuasive, or the author is very heartless
[12:47:41] <PapuaHardyNet> for one, you obviously are using a paid IRC client
[12:47:59] <PapuaHardyNet> however, if there's still a bug in it and you cannot petition the author to fix it, that means the client is a business failure now
[12:48:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... lol
[12:48:11] <PapuaHardyNet> therefore there is no economic sense in the author denying you your request

[12:49:05] <Obormot\Gaia> First of all
[12:49:23] <Obormot\Gaia> This app has been abandonware for the better part of a decade
[12:50:01] <PapuaHardyNet> that.. doesn't really change the conclusion
[12:50:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the author hasn't released the source by now, he clearly doesn't want to
[12:50:42] <PapuaHardyNet> okay
[12:50:45] <PapuaHardyNet> that makes sense
[12:51:01] <PapuaHardyNet> but you still can call him
[12:51:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> In any case even if I wanted to contact him, I have no idea how
[12:53:22] <pie_> are they even alive
[12:53:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea!
[12:54:07] <pie_> i am amused that my first assumption for something becoming abandonware is that the authors have died
[12:54:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> He was alive 3 years ago but now, who knows?
[12:54:23] <pie_> given thr youth of the internet thats probably not even that common, but i dont know
[12:54:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, well, no, dude stopped work on the thing long before the last we heard from him
[12:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not surprising, really. The whole thing was built on ancient APIs. The Mac OS X version was Carbon-based. That put a limit on its development lifespan right from the get-go...
[12:55:50] <pie_> maybe its because my life is a mess and im a pirate but can you even make money as a small software business just developing software
[12:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a complex question to answer
[12:56:18] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, you just need rich clients
[12:56:22] <pie_> everything is a saas or support contracts or whatever because its better for making moeny i iagine
[12:56:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> pie_: Are you familiar with shareware?
[12:56:51] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: support contracts dont count and "small" business
[12:56:58] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: well ok
[12:57:03] <pie_> Obormot\Arcturus: sort of
[12:57:12] <pie_> Obormot\Arcturus: does that work anymore?
[12:57:29] <pie_> im also open to deeper reading material on this because its relevant to things i want to do
[12:57:56] <pie_> the third option seems to be app stores
[12:58:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> pie_: Does it work anymore? Sort of yes, sort of no, mostly the answer is "differently", though there's a lot of "no" in that
[12:58:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> The thing is that Snak (this IRC client) dates back to a time when the Mac shareware scene was very active
[12:59:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now app stores (and on the Mac that means *the* App Store) dominate things, yes
[12:59:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> But some small indie software shops still exist
[12:59:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Panic still sells applications. So does Bare Bones. So does the GraphicConverter guy...
[13:00:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Ambrosia Software folded, for instance...
[13:02:17] <PapuaHardyNet> pie_: do you want to start a small busines that develops software for users?
[13:02:30] <PapuaHardyNet> by users I mean normal people and not business. end users is a better term, I guess
[13:02:30] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: its a bit of a pipe dream yeah
[13:03:15] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds like a great plan, but it is likely to be less profitable than being a software developer, unless you plan on going unicorn
[13:03:37] <pie_> i dont think i could pull that off. not at this point anyway
[13:03:40] <PapuaHardyNet> and you don't. Now, while people like DHH espouse the power of small businesses and sustainability, I don't think that works out in practice

[14:33:02] <feep> [09:19] <Obormot\Gaia> Critic (to friends): Have you heard of app X that Developer made? Isn't it dumb? Here's why it's dumb, and bad, and wrong: <some criticism>
[14:33:04] <feep> [09:19] <Obormot\Gaia> Developer, appearing in a puff of smoke: Ah, but wouldn't you like to hear why I made app X that way? I assure you, I have my reasons!
[14:33:05] <feep> [09:19] <saturn2> the bad thing is seeking out things to sneer at, or reasons to sneer at things, in order to glorify oneself
[14:33:07] <feep> Critic: fuck off
[14:33:14] <feep> * Developer has been kicked from #appdesign
[14:33:36] <feep> er, ignore saturn2's line there, copypaste error
[14:34:19] <feep> this is to me the irc equivalent of "developer gets downvoted"
[14:34:48] <feep> compare the tumblr post about how "rationalist tumblr is about topics, not opinions"
[14:35:04] <feep> the conversation above makes it clear imo that "the app" isn't actually the topic
[14:35:08] <feep> the topic is "the app is shit"
[14:35:17] <feep> specifically
[14:35:24] <feep> and that to me is the core of sneer culture.
[14:48:44] <feep> like, person A saying the app is shit and person B agreeing doesn't mean that the app being shit is the topic
[14:49:07] <feep> but someone saying "I think the app is shit" and not even this not being convincing, but this being *an unwanted contribution*
[14:49:13] <feep> is the key indicator.
[14:49:19] <feep> er, is not shit

[18:12:02] <kuudes> omicron being mild when compared to delta specifically would make sense; ie delta would have been somewhat of outlier in harshness, and other variants being less harsh in general
[18:12:09] <kuudes> I guess this would mean that omicron population penetration would compare to wuhan variant population penetration before vaccinations, given omicron bypasses about 2 doses of vaccines, so the result would be something like in Italy and Iran had

[19:10:29] <rsaarelm> EO Wilson: "We had a meeting to take the final vote on Lewontin at Harvard, and a group of the older professors said they were worried about reports of his behavior at Chicago—that he might be disruptive or might have gotten away from genetics, and so would not be the right sort of person to be at Harvard.

[19:55:29] <kuudes> shouldn't that be about the first step as an entrepreneuer
[19:55:47] <PapuaHardyNet> well, one reason could be that he doesn't want to be seen as difficult
[19:56:20] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps the client has a lot of influence with his potential clients and he is willing to take the hit to ensure he has clients in the future
[19:56:42] <kuudes> contacting means calling by phone or emailing etc
[19:56:52] <kuudes> that does not cause anything to happen with the client or public image.
[19:57:10] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, I don't know. I'd ask shawwn, but he won't talk to me
[19:57:14] <kuudes> it has nothing to do with "seen as difficult"
[19:57:25] <kuudes> because it has nothing to do with "seen"
[19:57:35] <kuudes> whereas twitter surely is "seen"
[19:57:44] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, you make sense. Honestly, he isn't in the right state of mind
[19:58:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I expect him to be doing something to drown himself in, instead of calling an attorney and talking business
[19:58:29] <PapuaHardyNet> and linear is correct, twitter is a source of emotional support
[19:59:51] <kuudes> I mean, this is the thing if one becomes an entrepreneuer instead of an employee

[20:54:10] * pompolic equips sunglasses
[20:54:14] <pompolic> "less wrong"
[20:54:24] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahahah
[20:54:42] <linear> can't wait to see what internet culture will give us in the coming years
[20:55:12] <pompolic> sort of related to that thought: i think vr ui conventions and control schemes invaded my dreams
[20:55:21] <pompolic> everything went better than expected
[20:56:19] <feep> yeah after alyx everyone just goes around for a day or so jerking their hand at items and expecting them to come flying
[20:56:48] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh, there's this very schizophrenic culture in femboy communities I've seen online
[20:58:12] <PapuaHardyNet> there's this explicit outpouring of a desire to be seen as feminine and to be treated sexually as feminine, and there's also this... weird explicit assertion that people who want to date femboys / people who identify as "traps" are only using them for sex so they will stay away from them
[20:59:30] <pompolic> feep: i suppose it's like astronauts accidentally dropping objects after they land because they're used to 0g
[20:59:58] <feep> ^^
[21:00:15] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: that's kind of sad :(
[21:01:13] <pompolic> casually TKing objects is also not unheard of in my paracosm because why not
[21:01:20] <ggreer> I am 100% convinced that is just astronauts pranking people
[21:01:31] <pompolic> in a sense alyx is closer to what I'm used to
[21:02:08] <pompolic> i think you really can lose your expectation of gravity that easily
[21:02:30] <pompolic> this makes me optimistic for things like spending significant amount of time in space or other weird environments
[21:02:35] <ggreer> To someone used to zero g, you’d notice gravity pulling on your body all the time. You’d feel your arm being accelerated downward while holding the pen
[21:02:37] <pompolic> i don't think there would be problems with mental adaptation
[21:03:04] <pompolic> people don't really have gears-level models of physics imo
[21:03:55] <pompolic> so "gravity on me" and "objects fall when i let go" is probably modeled separately
[21:04:25] <pompolic> to make things worse, in VR, objects can be selectively immune to gravity
[21:05:13] <ggreer> Unless it’s super light, you’d feel the pen too. Also you’d grasp it so that it didn’t fall out of your hand. In zero g you’d just hold it any way you wanted.
[21:05:52] <feep> I think it'd happen
[21:06:04] <feep> you'd notice it, and you'd keep a grasp on it, but you'd still do the "let go and assume it will stay there"
[21:06:06] <pompolic> you feel the mass of an object even in 0g
[21:06:10] <feep> because that's simply an unrelated mechanism
[21:06:11] <pompolic> yeah exactly
[21:06:55] <feep> "yes this pen has a weight and I can feel it, so now let me just park it in midair where it will remain, drifting slowly" you really think a human brain can't think that sentence? especially instinctively?
[21:07:17] <feep> seems to be giving us a lot of credit in "instinct updating speed" :p
[21:07:56] <ggreer> I’ve been using vr for years and I’ve never mixed up vr stuff and real world stuff
[21:09:03] <PapuaHardyNet> you haven't been playing enough video games then
[21:09:33] <pompolic> well, i'm arguing that such "instincts" (i think they're software though) get updated really quickly
[21:09:56] <PapuaHardyNet> by spending enough time playing Skyrim I came to expect an infobox pop up when I focused on any item - and I wasn't even using VR
[21:10:32] <pompolic> Bartle goes a bit into how people model physics in virtual worlds, but i don't recall it enough to cite. i remember "ultraphysics" ie expectations about magic though
[21:10:50] <pompolic> and i think "ultraphysics" wouldn't exist if people had a gears-level model of physics
[21:11:07] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: you should write your thoughts on virtual worlds somewhere
[21:11:17] <pompolic> tangent: i keep wanting to say "the model does not connect together in the middle" rather than "gears-level"
[21:11:27] <pompolic> i should
[21:11:44] <Ralith> PapuaHardyNet: maybe you're just especially bad at distinguishing reality from games?
[21:11:45] <PapuaHardyNet> please do! I'll be the first to read it
[21:11:47] <pompolic> maybe it would be a good opening post for a blog
[21:12:28] <feep> Ralith: I have this thing too
[21:12:38] <feep> should go on a survey maybe
[21:12:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I see I'm in very respectable company
[21:13:02] <pompolic> i think it has to do with something like suggestibility. i don't know if there's a metric for that
[21:13:21] <pompolic> i think that a) "suggestibility" varies b) correlated with how hard you get immersed into VR and similar
[21:14:05] <feep> credulosity
[21:14:06] <feep> :D
[21:14:08] <PapuaHardyNet> suggestibility is a loaded word
[21:14:18] <feep> maybe it generalizes.
[21:14:21] <PapuaHardyNet> immersion is a function of both the person and the virtual world
[21:14:22] <feep> rubeness
[21:14:29] <pompolic> hah
[21:14:32] <feep> exploitability
[21:14:48] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example, while feep streamed Fallout 4, it all looked so very gamey to me
[21:14:54] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: maybe "hypnotizability" would be better
[21:14:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I didn't get immersed at all
[21:15:05] <pompolic> because i was reaching for a neutral word
[21:15:08] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I don't get immersed in 3d games either unless I'm the one moving the camera
[21:15:14] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. good point
[21:15:21] <pompolic> for "how hard you get immersed into a virtual environment"
[21:15:24] <feep> in fact, I get sick :p
[21:15:28] <pompolic> implication: hypnosis is just flesh VR

[21:59:47] <ggreer> usually people have the opposite issue with VR: they think VR is real and react accordingly. that's how my headset has a cracked strap and scratches. it's also why my dad accidentally punched me and smashed a lamp and almost ran through a plate glass window
