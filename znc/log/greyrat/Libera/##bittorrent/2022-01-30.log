[03:14:23] <wwrrtt> I'm getting Nigerian connections from a lot of different IP addresses from the same /16 range. The 3rd octet varies between 4-5 different values, the 4th takes many different values but some are close together (e.g., 70, 73, 75, 78)    Connection: BT, Flags: X
[03:14:33] <wwrrtt> Would sharing the magnet here be against the rules? I have no idea why someone would connect like that
[03:14:44] <wwrrtt> The connections last about a second or two, 0 bytes transferred
[03:27:27] <DeHackEd> weird stuff happens on the internet. I wouldn't worry about it too much unless it actually impacts your connection

[05:05:35] <Hurricane> wwrrtt, it's just a Nigerian prince
[05:05:47] <Hurricane> he'll probably need you to help him recover his gold
[05:07:10] <wwrrtt> Hurricane: Weird! I'm already helping another Nigerian prince recover his inheritance stolen by his evil uncle
[05:07:40] <Hurricane> wwrrtt, 2022 must be a bad year for Nigerian Princes
[05:07:58] <Hurricane> let's help them out, I mean they only need 1200$ for a bank transfer
