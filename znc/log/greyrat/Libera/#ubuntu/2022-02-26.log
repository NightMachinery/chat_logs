[00:40:27] <taholmes160> Hi Folks: When I first set up my ubuntu system, and was using the local screen, keyboard and mouse, the terminal window and nautilus both had really good looking themes on them. The machine is intended to run headless over the local area network and is accessed via RDC -- for some reason, the themes have vanished when I connect via RDC and the current ones are really ugly

[03:54:27] <BinarySavior> according to these docs, i need to set the access-control-allow-origin header to *

[04:07:38] <Sven_vB> hi :)
[04:07:47] <Sven_vB> Seems like lots of cheap USB ethernet adapters are "Kontron DM9601 USB Ethernet Adapter" under the hood, and they all have MAC 00:e0:4c:53:44:58 albeit I sourced them from different vendors. I found a tutorial on how to deal with them on https://karser.dev/same-mac-kontron-dm9601/ ; maybe we should include a fix in Ubuntu by default, what do you think?

[04:12:42] <Eickmeyer> Sven_vB: Seems as though that requires knowing the MAC address for each one, so that's not something that can be done with a blanket setting. I was going to tell you to file a bug report, but it's too device-specific.
[04:13:11] <Eickmeyer> Oh wait, they share the same mac address.
[04:13:22] <Eickmeyer> That's a security nightmare either way.

[04:14:08] <Sven_vB> what do you mean by security nightmare?
[04:14:54] <Eickmeyer> Two identical mac addresses on the same network is a no-no.
[04:15:16] <Sven_vB> yes, even more it's a routing problem with my hub apparently

[04:15:36] <Eickmeyer> Exactly. It's asking for packet collisions and misrouting.
[04:15:53] <Sven_vB> the tutorial assigns new MACs based on USB path, I'll probably randomize the last 3 bytes so it works even if the USB numbers happen to match up accross hosts
[04:15:55] <semitones> i made the mistake of thinking i had more disk space than I had, and now I have to clear a bunch of stuff to finish apt upgrading
[04:16:06] <semitones> is it safe to delete /var/log/journal contents?
[04:16:21] <Eickmeyer> Sven_vB: Either way, that's not something that can be done by default in Ubuntu.
[04:17:06] <Sven_vB> Eickmeyer, an official fix would probably need its own legitimately registered MAC pool to pull from. is that the obstacle?
[04:17:15] <Ravage> semitones: try to edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf and set SystemMaxUse=100M or so
[04:17:17] <Eickmeyer> Sven_vB: Yes, very much so.
[04:17:20] <Ravage> and restart the service
[04:17:22] <semitones> the 3 big places I could delete are: /var/log/journal, the old kernels, and /var/cache/apt/archives
[04:17:33] <Ravage> that will clean up the logs ins a safe way
[04:17:42] <semitones> thanks for the advice
[04:17:51] <Eickmeyer> Sven_vB: I'd recommend talking about this sort of thing in #networking . They'd have more insight.

[05:11:01] <sarnold> yeah don't delete those manually; purge packages you don't use, if you want to clean that up a bit, but do *not* treat that directory as one big homogenous entity
[05:11:38] <leftyfb> semitones: drill down, are there more than 1 kernel directories ?
[05:12:04] <sarnold> (btw those are libraries, not kernels)
[05:12:12] <semitones> good advice let me look what has remained
[05:12:13] <leftyfb> You can purge kernels you aren’t using, but if there’s only 1 kernel, I wouldn’t touch anything in that directory

[05:16:46] <leftyfb> semitones: from what I understand, studio uses Jack for sound as opposed to pulse audio. If you don’t have pulse installed, removing Jack will remove your sound capabilities
[05:17:20] <semitones> can i just apt install pulseaudio
[05:18:05] <leftyfb> You can, but over never known pulse to be that easy to get running from a system that didn’t have it already
[05:18:59] <semitones> hmm maybe I will leave jack alone for the time being
[05:20:09] <semitones> can I uninstall gcc? I don't have an nvidia gfx card, so I don't think I need to compile any dkms modules
[05:22:02] <sarnold> yeah, probably; most people don't need it; be sure to keep going, delete eg gcc-10 or gcc-9 or whatever other packages you've got installed; maybe you've got some -dev packages installed that don't need, too; dpkg -l '*-dev' | grep '^ii'  might be useful, too
[05:22:15] <semitones> if I removed libreoffice already, can i delete /var/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libreoffice
[05:22:23] <semitones> that's a good idea with the -dev

[07:16:16] <jhutchins> Comnenus: They're all in use.  At least they work as line conditioners.
[07:16:40] <jhutchins> Comnenus: (That's what I meant by "on-line".)
[07:17:13] <Comnenus> jhutchins: understood, good point.

[15:19:28] <tomreyn> dojo: the tutorial i linked to explains how you can download SHA256SUM (checksums) and SHA256SUM.gpg (cryptographic signature over SHA256SUM) files from the release mirrors and use the gpg software to authenticate the checksum files

[15:22:37] <tomreyn> when you *both* verify the checksum of the download and use a software such as balena etcher (as shown on the tutorial), which will verify the data was properly written to the install media (usb stick?), you should be a in a good position to make an installation. note that the installer itself does also run a self-test on some files while it boots.

[21:50:33] <plujon> I'm on ubuntu 20.04 and using Wayland.  I'm not sure what "window manager" I'm using.  I'd like to be able to move windows with the keyboard, like I used to do when I used OpenBox.  In particular, I want to move windows horizontally instead of having them take up half the screen when I push Super-left or Super-right.
