[00:03:10] <antross> isekaijin: thanks for helping me.  Here are the benchmarks I'm using to guide me - thttps://github.com/fastify/benchmarks#benchmarks  .  So polkadot can do roughly 60k req/s with 15ms in per request latency but now I'm second guessing what latency actually represents here.  I thought it was per-request latency but that doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:04:00] <antross> maybe latency is start up time :thinking:

[00:10:08] <isekaijin> There is some variation in the product across the different entries in the table, but for now I'm tentatively attributing this variation to the fact that the latencies aren't given with too many significant digits.

[00:10:49] <orbisvicis> antross: 1 request / 15ms -> 4000 requests/ minute, to get 60K there must be some parallelization

[00:12:48] <isekaijin> Unfortunately, this project's README isn't terribly explicit about the methodology used to construct this table. So there's some implicit background knowledge about what these numbers mean, that is perhaps obvious to the target audience of this project, but not to me.
[00:13:39] <buster> networking folks know about that. you measure two of those things and calculate the third.

[00:17:51] <orbisvicis> I would like to know how to solve a system of two implicit equations in two variables numerically
[00:18:11] <isekaijin> Newton's method can be generalized to systems of n equations in n variables.
[00:18:18] <orbisvicis> I know one is strictly increasing and one strictly decreasing and the ranges mostly overlap
[00:18:20] <orbisvicis> it can?
[00:18:22] <isekaijin> It can.
[00:19:35] <isekaijin> As long as your solution and your starting point are in a region that doesn't contain critical points or “almost critical” points (where the Jacobian is degenerate or “almost degenerate”), it should behave reasonably well.
[00:19:36] <orbisvicis> if this was a single equation of a single variables I would use a taylor series to get an approximation (sum of erfs, no closed form expression), then apply series reversion to get the initial approximation
[00:20:22] <orbisvicis> well that answers that question regarding starting point
[00:21:32] <orbisvicis> isekaijin: iirc from maths, jacobian is a matrix of derivatives, does almost almost critical / almost degenerate apply to strictly increasing/decreasing ?
[00:22:13] <isekaijin> By a “critical point”, I mean one where the Jacobian matrix isn't invertible.
[00:24:49] *** Joins: mnl (~mnl@user/mnl)
[00:26:02] <isekaijin> Let's start with the definition of Newton's method in one variable: x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n).
[00:26:05] <isekaijin> The multivariate version would be something like x_{n+1} = x_n - [Jf(x_n)]^{-1} f(x_n), where Jf(x_n) is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at x_n.
[00:26:23] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[00:26:31] <isekaijin> So we need the inverse of the Jacobian matrix - now you see why Jf being (close to) noninvertible poses a problem.
[00:27:36] <isekaijin> (I'm assuming that both x_n and f(x_n) are column vectors. If they are row vectors, the Jacobian needs to be multiplied to the right of f(x_n) instead.)

[00:30:23] <isekaijin> orbisvicis: Another thing that we need to consider for functions of several variables, the region where Jf is invertible needn't be convex. So, to be cautious, we pick some 0 < alpha < 1, and then use x_{n+1} = x_n - alpha * [Jf(x_n)]^{-1} f(x_n). For the toy problems I worked with, alpha = 0.7 or 0.8 was good enough.

[00:38:44] <isekaijin> What does it mean for a function of two variables to be “increasing”?
[00:40:01] <antross> oh i see now why my ratios didn't work.  latency in ms needs to be converted to seconds because with a 15ms request, I can do ~66 a second and with 200ms I can only do 5.  Once, I set the ratios to:  60_000 / 66 = X / 5 => I get the right answer

[03:42:52] <cuppajoeman> I'm not sure how to formally say this, but it seems like after the point k, in general the trend is to go down more. So if we consider f(f(x)) then that value is inspect f(k) where k is closer to zero meaning f(k) is either in the beginning part where we have f(n) = n, and f(k+1) is some super small value. That should yield a contradiction because if we had f(4) = 8 and later on f(1000) = 1, and then f(999) = 4, then f(f(999))
[03:42:52] <cuppajoeman> < f(1000) would be false ...
[03:43:06] <dude12312414> so you're trying to "interpolate" z_n by a holomorphic function over a connected subset
[03:43:32] <cuppajoeman> Any tips to improve that? PlanckWalk
[03:44:57] <cuppajoeman> I just want to say that the f(f( x )) is going to map you backwards to a y value like a and f( x + 1 ) is going to map you to a value b where a > b because things are "going down".

The most general version is this: If (z_n) is any sequence of pairwise distinct complex numbers with |z_n| -> infty  (so for your case, use the sequence 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...), then an entire function f exists where for each n, f along with finitely many of its derivatives have any desired arbitrary values at z_n.  The "finitely many" can vary with n.

[09:33:27] <greenbagels> oh the link i sent also has a video at the bottom, nice
[09:34:10] <mycroftiv> ski: it is following up on what i regarded as 'loose ends' in both Penrose and Hofstadter that led me to large cardinals and ultrafilters
[09:34:26] <ski> hm, interesting
[09:34:31] <ski> (i wonder how)
[09:34:41] <mycroftiv> ski: see, i branched off in the pure logic direction - 'what formal power could brains have that exceeds finite computability' ?
[09:35:06] <mycroftiv> ski: because large cardinal axioms are ideas of logical truth or possibility that exceed the definable-constructible
[09:35:46] <mycroftiv> so the idea that our brains can somehow 'rise above and move between' formal systems freely didnt seem to me to mean indefinable magic, maybe we are just using Strong axioms internally to evaluate weaker systems
[09:36:45] <mycroftiv> which then raises the natural question of how these strong axioms 'exist' and all my wild ideas about Very Large state spaces in a cosmological sense and minds as models reflecting this

[09:47:48] <ski> for each positive outcome (the ones you're considering as successful, for the event you're looking for), add its corresponding probability weight to a total sum
[09:48:22] <greenbagels> is the fact that the support of the det : Mat(n x n, R) -> R is open simply just a consequence of it being continuous, and the fact that continuous preimages of open sets (a la R \ {0}) are open?

Each of them separately have dimensions in even pixel numbers (no decimal) but when I combine
[10:41:34] <blahboybaz> them the combination of the two has dimesions with decimal (fraction) of pixels. Is it something in the quotient (length x width) of one of them or of some difference between them that is causing this?

[13:19:49] <lmat> PlanckWalk: Yes. Both visually and intuitively knowing whence the data come.

[13:20:27] <lmat> PlanckWalk: The data are: given an angle, where do the blades of a pair of scissors touch.

[13:20:42] <PlanckWalk> Ah, then there will be an exact formula

[13:21:29] <lmat> causative_: I would be open to a piecewise fit, but I need to be able to interpolate somewhat accurately between any of the points, and extrapolate a little bit left and right of the points.

[13:31:39] <lmat> causative_: It's pulses on a motor encoder :shrug:
[13:31:53] <lmat> causative_: They should be linearly related to the angle.
[13:32:17] <causative_> x is related to the angle, but negative?
[13:32:26] <greenbagels> it's also easy to check whether the data is logarithmic or not; just plot on a log-scale
[13:32:49] <lmat> causative_: Yeah. The "zero" position of the motor happens to be with the blades all the way open.

[13:33:32] <causative_> from hinge or from blade?
[13:33:45] <lmat> PlanckWalk: "1/tan instead of 1/sin"  but earlier you said "It should be proportional to inverse sine"
[13:33:59] <lmat> causative_: From the nut (hinge).
[13:34:08] <PlanckWalk> lmat: "Ah, I was taking it to be the distance from hinge to cutting point"
[13:34:30] <causative_> lmat, that seems like a less accurate way to measure it, how do you know you got the exact center?

[13:34:39] <PlanckWalk> No, not arcin
[13:34:42] <PlanckWalk> arcsin*
[13:35:22] <lmat> causative_: I don't. Everything in these measurements is eyeballed. I held a ruler up and drew on the scissors with a sharpie. I drove the motor until the scissors were about closed to the line I drew. Don't take the data too seriously now...

[13:50:49] <lmat> greenbagels: Wow, that's complicated :-D
[13:51:13] <greenbagels> in my mind its more or less the same complication as trying to guess the functional form of the equation itself
[13:51:44] <causative_> well just get more data points, why stop at 7

[16:17:51] <riv> assume a,b not n,mth roots respectively etc.
[16:18:03] <Gurkenglas> What's it called when syntactic consequence <=> semantic consequence?
[16:18:47] <riv> not sure. do you have an example?
[16:19:59] <Gurkenglas> when a statement is provable iff it holds in all models
[16:20:21] <Gurkenglas> (that was a rephrasing, not an example, afaic)

[16:21:59] <Gurkenglas> thanks.
[16:23:30] <Gurkenglas> "in an axiomatic system, proof of soundness amounts to verifying the validity of the axioms and that the rules of inference preserve validity (or the weaker property, truth)" "An argument is valid if, assuming its premises are true, the conclusion must be true." <- then isn't truth stronger than validity?
[16:24:03] <riv> I have never heard of validity
[16:24:08] <riv> how is that defined
[16:24:24] <Gurkenglas> it's defined in my last line :P

[16:27:14] <Gurkenglas> waaaait. "validity (or the weaker property, truth)" should actually already fail on validity being about arguments and truth about statements, so one can't compare their strength, right?

[21:29:22] <cadmio> I need to find the minimal poly of this (2)^(1/3) + √5
[21:30:12] <cadmio> I tried to calculate the 6th power of that number and got
[21:30:46] <cadmio> 2^2 + 6⋅2^(5/3) √5 + 15 2^(4/3) 5 + 20 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 5^(3/2) + 15⋅2^(2/3) ⋅ 5^2 + 6 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1/3 ⋅ 5^(5/2) + 5^3
[21:31:14] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so suppose that f(k) = k + d, then we have this sequence  a_(n+1) = f(a_n - 1)  when a_n > 0, and then f(a_(n+1)) < f(a_n) where we define a_0 = k, then if we consider the chain of inequalities f(a_0) > f(a_1) > f(a_2) > ... > f(a_(k+d)), then since it's decreasing by at least one each time, that chain could be like k+d, k+d-1, k+d - 2, ..., 3, 2, 1, 0.

[23:47:25] <leibniz> now i fit the surface to the noisy control points, i need a wider stencil
[23:47:39] <leibniz> then i use the cfl condition
[23:47:46] <leibniz> and argue about stability analysis
[23:48:04] <leibniz> i was able to make the grid more sparse while staying stable

[23:51:53] <leibniz> you go "off shell" using mean field hydrodynamics, ie temperature in thermodynamics. you get entropy and dispersion as numerically stabilising, and you push the cfl condition for accelerated numerical flow schemes
[23:52:44] <leibniz> so i seek a stability region for thermodynamic flows via soft topological calculus
[23:53:15] <dude12312414> i could write a bot that generates sentences with random words pulled out of some textbook that makes as much sense as that
[23:53:41] <leibniz> the martingales allow finite process sampling to accelerate over converged pdfs, giving a second form of saving from the roughness, connected with the martingales
[23:54:06] <leibniz> dude12312414: sure, and centre reality around its physical realisation
[23:54:29] <leibniz> if you like that sort of thing
[23:55:23] <Gurkenglas> is there a difference between "linear, non-basis-preserving functions between vector spaces with a basis given" and "nondeterministic functions between sets"?

[23:58:41] <leibniz> "where did you get that gradient data from"!?
[23:59:04] <leibniz> hmm, might be slightly faster than the speed of light, just as well its noisy enough so we dont care!
[23:59:36] <leibniz> deep rough spacetime
[23:59:57] <leibniz> its quantum gravity im telling you
