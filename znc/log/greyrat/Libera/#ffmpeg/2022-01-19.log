[02:06:56] <akk> Hi -- I'm trying to use an SLR camera as a webcam, as in http://www.gphoto.org/doc/remote/ "Using as webcam / video conferencing camera"
[02:06:57] <aphysically> haasn: ah okay, cool; and part of the tone mapping rework opens up the potential to do that in the future, I guess
[02:07:07] <akk> so I'm doing: gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0 -f v4l2 /dev/video2
[02:07:31] <akk> but when I connect to /dev/video2 with an app like cheese, all I see is blackness, no picture.
[02:08:22] <akk> But I can see a picture with: gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | ffplay -       so I wonder if maybe there's something wrong with the ffmpeg arguments
[02:09:22] <BtbN> I doubt you can just write rawvideo to /dev and expect it to work.
[02:09:36] <BtbN> There's some v4l2 loopback driver, but not sure if ffmpeg supports feeding that.
[02:10:49] <akk> The page on gphoto.org claims it works, as do lots of web pages (but they're mostly old pages, possibly the needed arguments have changed)
[02:15:45] <furq> does playback work with mpv or vlc
[02:18:47] <akk> vlc v4l2:// also gives a black screen
[02:20:22] <akk> oh, duh, that wasn't specifying the camera. vlc v4l2:///dev/video2 does show a picture!
[02:21:31] *** Quits: irc_user (uid423822@id-423822.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:21:44] <akk> So vlc knows something that cheese and guvcview don't about that video stream.
[02:22:22] <akk> The ultimate goal is to use it with webconferencing like the zoom app or jitsi in a browser.

[06:27:02] <Macer> BtbN: horrible for quality or speed or both? since i don't have a gpu at all i've been using x265 and 1080p encoding i am happy if it crosses 30fps
[06:27:14] <furq> if you just want to capture footage without hitting the cpu then it works
[06:27:15] <BtbN> speed is pretty much the only thing it's good at
[06:27:22] <furq> you need to throw a lot of rate at it
[06:27:57] <BtbN> If you want to encode stuff for archiving, no hwenc makes sense
[06:27:59] <furq> but if your alternative is huffyuv then it's not that bad
[06:28:32] <furq> and yeah nvenc is not suitable for archival either
[06:28:42] <Macer> BtbN: is the quality that bad?

[06:28:52] *** Joins: lucaswang (~lucaswang@58.246.19.98)
[06:28:54] <Macer> that's exactly what i'm doing. archival to hevc
[06:29:05] <furq> the quality is perfectly fine if you don't mind spending 25-50% more bitrate for it
[06:29:05] <BtbN> Yeah, no way around x265 on a slow preset for that
[06:29:46] <Macer> so in reality probably just good for real time re-encode for streaming?
[06:29:52] <furq> yeah that's what they're designed for
[06:30:01] <furq> that's why they're attached to gpus
[06:30:17] <BtbN> They also make sense if you want to record something in real time, while using the PC
[06:30:23] <furq> right
[06:30:28] <BtbN> like, for low perf impact game recording at stupid high bitrate, they're great
[06:30:54] <BtbN> Nvidia also tuned nvenc for that.
[06:31:00] <furq> well a lot of games would make any video encoder upset
[06:31:09] <BtbN> It outperforms x264 at usual real-time settings.
[06:31:15] <BtbN> Which is massively impressive
[06:31:53] <Macer> is it something that joe eyeballs would really notice if it was used for archival purposes?
[06:31:54] <BtbN> Like, if your choice is between streaming x264 veryfast or nvenc on a Turing/Ampere card, at the same bitrate, nvenc wins
[06:32:04] <BtbN> Your disk would sure notice
[06:32:15] <furq> did they tune it to not shit the bed if you play an fps
[06:32:35] <furq> i guess that's not as bad with games being slow and having motion blur nowadays
[06:32:35] <BtbN> Not any more than x264 would when bitrate contrained like that.
[06:32:52] <BtbN> And being at a real-time capable preset
[06:33:16] <furq> but i can confirm that x264 really does not like quake
[06:33:21] <BtbN> quite a bit less even. The Turing nvenc chip is really impressively good
[06:33:22] <Macer> lol
[06:33:33] <furq> i never played tribes 2 but i'm sure that would be a disaster
[06:34:03] <BtbN> h264 1080p60, limited to 6~8Mbit/s as streaming sites usually do, always looks like shit, no matter the encoder
[06:34:10] <Macer> BtbN: the problem is getting a hold of a turing gpu
[06:34:28] <Macer> 1060 going for $500? when will it end?
[06:34:47] <furq> Macer: nvenc at the same rate as competently encoded archival quality x265 will look noticeably worse
[06:34:48] <BtbN> Hm? I could order a 1650 for like 300€ right now
[06:35:10] <BtbN> And I'm pretty sure that has the latest nvenc silicon
[06:35:12] <furq> you could make nvenc look as good if you have disk space
[06:35:32] <Macer> furq: that would defeat teh purpose a bit
[06:35:46] <furq> well that's what we're getting at
[06:35:51] <Macer> yah heh
[06:35:59] <BtbN> Don't underestimate nvenc though. It really got quite good, specially at the speed it does its thing at. But yeah, for archival, all that matters is maximum quality without exploding too much in size.
[06:36:15] <furq> it's just not tuned for that
[06:36:21] <furq> and being in silicon means what it's tuned for is what you get
[06:36:30] <BtbN> So use x265 or x264, select a crf value you're happy with, slow preset, and encode away
[06:36:51] <furq> it's designed for streaming acceptable looking footage of video games at whatever the maximum bitrate twitch accepts is
[06:36:53] <BtbN> hevc_nvenc in target quality mode is really not THAT far off from what x265 does.
[06:36:59] <Macer> BtbN: that's what i've been doing. but it's like watching grass grow lol
[06:36:59] <furq> and it's pretty good at that by all accounts
[06:37:30] <Macer> but then again i'm using a 3700x so i guess that's a bit on me
[06:37:30] <BtbN> Well, if you want to sacrifice quality or disk space for a faster encode, that's up to you
[06:38:16] <BtbN> The 1650 is even low-profile. Quite a nice card, but definitely overpriced at 300€

[06:47:09] <Macer> well thanks for the information it helped a lot .. guess i'll hold off on swapping the 3700x for the 5700G
[06:47:59] <Macer> too bad the 5700G wasn't available earlier. i doubt the performance is much better than a 3700x for the cpu but at least i'd probably be able to offload plex transcoding (if that is something i could even get to work)
[06:48:16] <Macer> not really sure how well linux is supporting this nowadays
[06:49:21] <BtbN> AMF on Linux is quite a mess, since there's like 3 different drivers, all supporting it differently, with different parts being broken
[06:50:07] <furq> hwenc for plex etc transcoding is broadly fine if you have enough network bandwidth
[06:50:13] <furq> i know a few people using nvenc for it
[06:50:39] <Macer> furq: yeah. you see tested and true nvenc all over the place but not much from amd flavors
[06:50:52] <Macer> probably for the reasons BtbN explained
[06:51:07] <furq> it's just a lot less mature and i think amd have lower market share in general
[06:51:17] <furq> oh wow 83% nvidia
[06:51:23] <Macer> heh
[06:51:23] <furq> that'd explain it
[06:51:44] <Macer> market share for gaming or video enc/dec?
[06:52:08] <Macer> i'd figure nowadays people are just getting what they can get a hold of (amd included)
[06:52:13] <furq> that's for all discrete gpus i think
[06:52:22] <BtbN> Getting ahold of GPUs really isn't the issue
[06:52:27] <BtbN> The shops here are well stocked
[06:52:34] <BtbN> just asking twice as much as they'd normally ask
[06:53:16] <furq> they're all low on stock here just not at crisis point
[06:53:24] <Macer> BtbN: i was including price as a "getting what they can get a hold of" factor :)
[06:53:28] <furq> like you can get a 1650 but you pick from one of five cards instead of one of 30
[06:53:53] <furq> and of course they're all £100 marked up
[06:56:51] <libredev> How i convert mp4 with yuv420p to mp4 yuv444p with quality loss.
[06:57:54] <BtbN> Why would you do that?
[06:58:05] <BtbN> There is _nothing_ to gain from that conversion
[06:58:26] <Macer> https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/pull/2251
[06:58:32] <irc_user> He's trying to crop videos in ffmpeg with linear animations
[06:58:38] <Macer> ah there is some discussion on amf .. i'll take a look at that
[06:58:39] <irc_user> BtbN:
[06:59:19] <libredev> Because i want to crop the video with given x and y which are function of time
[07:00:00] <BtbN> And cropping it at multiples of two is not good enough?
[07:00:26] <libredev> Yeh? kepstin says that.
[07:00:46] <libredev> said*
[07:01:00] <BtbN> can always just throw a format=yuv444p right before the crop filter if you really need that kind of precision. But it seems unneccesary to me.
[07:01:17] <kepstin> well, it's up to you. multiples of 2s might end up with a jumpy pan depending on the speed
[07:02:25] <BtbN> You are just limited to cropping to a size in multiples of two
[07:02:36] <BtbN> you can pan with pixel precision
[07:03:24] <libredev> BtbN: so that step is not necessary
[07:03:34] <libredev> ?
[07:03:49] <BtbN> very much depends on what you're doing, but it seems unneccesary to me.
[07:04:13] <BtbN> If you're transcoding to crop anyway, you might as well throw it in, and it'll not hurt except make the transcode slightly slower and reduce compat of the output
[07:04:43] <kepstin> i'd expect you to convert the result back to yuv420p before encoding normally
[07:05:03] <libredev> BtbN: ok can u give me the command
[07:05:13] <irc_user> Not to beat a dead horse but I think you may have been done by now had you used a video editor
[07:05:28] <BtbN> I have no idea what exactly you're doing, so no idea what command I could possibly give you
[07:06:34] <libredev> BtbN: crop my mp4 and i give the x and y as a function of time and the dimensions
[07:07:09] <BtbN> You don't need to worry about yuv stuff for that at all, as long as the output dimensions are multiples of two
[07:07:48] <BtbN> not sure how smart the crop filter is though, it might not like re-writing yuv like that?
[07:07:51] <libredev> BtbN: that cool because it always will be multiple of 2
[07:08:46] <libredev> BtbN: just provide me a basic one. I will test
[07:09:32] <libredev> I read the crop section but it lacks example

[07:45:48] <kepstin> retaining original bitrate is a different thing from retaining original quality. If you do want to retain bitrate, you'd want to measure bitrate of the original file, then set it on the new output using the bitrate options, and probably do a 2-pass encode.
[07:46:27] <kepstin> (if you're using libx264 encoder, i'd instead recommend picking a value of crf that produces sufficient quality without making too big of a file)

[08:10:17] <kepstin> not sure what you mean copy. You're making a new video with different content, so you have to encode it with newly chosen settings.

[08:13:28] <kepstin> the movement is jittering?
[08:13:37] <libredev> Yeh
[08:13:40] <kepstin> as i said, that's because of the subsampled chroma.

[18:43:19] <BtbN> yuv444 does not have that limitation, since it doesn't combine the U and V planes for multiple pixels.
[18:43:41] <BtbN> Converting from 420 to 444 rarely makes sense, if ever. You gain nothing from it.

[19:07:01] <BtbN> I can't watch random videos right now. If you have random jittering, it's probably either poor deinterlacing, or it's in an odd framerate and you're converting it to a normal one, or vice versa.
[19:07:18] <kepstin> indeed, it's jumping in 2 pixel increments due to the limitations of yuv420p. converting to yuv444p means it can jump in 1px increments, but that's still kinda jittery (just less so)
[19:07:53] <kepstin> any "proper" solution for doing a smooth arbitrary-speed pan would require interpolation to do subpixel motion
[19:08:04] <kepstin> afaik ffmpeg doesn't have anything to do that.
[19:08:23] <kepstin> (though you could do something silly like scale the entire video larger, pan, scale smaller)
[19:10:16] <libredev> kepstin: ohh thanks, so how i scale and move

[21:04:41] <kepstin> yeah, i think odd width/height yuv420p is technically possible, although it's effecively treated as a larger even image with the final row/column not shown?
[21:05:47] <kepstin> many video codecs don't support that, tho.

[23:44:04] <alphamule> Hmm, decided to go looking into this again for technical details of how to implement what I want.
[23:44:49] <alphamule> It looks trivial to parse the JSON file to output a concat file.  Guess I know what I need to do.  :-D
[23:46:15] <alphamule> Let's hope I dont end up with annoying bugs.
[23:46:18] *** drv_ is now known as drv
[23:46:56] <furq> you could also just encode it cfr and then remux with something that supports timestamp files
[23:47:00] <furq> https://mkvtoolnix.download/doc/mkvmerge.html#mkvmerge.external_timestamp_files
[23:47:22] <alphamule> Converting them to CFR is doable but not only messes with quality (potentially) but vastly increases file sizes
[23:47:25] <alphamule> Yeah
[23:47:36] <alphamule> That was the one thing I was hoping to avoid.
[23:47:40] <furq> no i mean one frame per image
[23:47:48] <alphamule> I was thinking of that right when you mentioned
[23:47:56] <alphamule> Ah

[23:49:32] <alphamule> That... looks handy, as well
[23:50:09] <alphamule> So two tools to do it.  Sweet
[23:51:26] <alphamule> I was intending to make WEBM files from JPEG source.  So looks like this will work.
[23:51:50] <alphamule> I got that part working, but the framerate was obviously CFR in output.
[23:53:13] <alphamule> So I can either use concat and do it input side, or do it middlewise between ffmpeg and a tool like mkvmerge.
[23:54:02] <alphamule> So you just shove the frames into the file and then change the actual timing later with that method, right?
[23:54:10] <alphamule> Making sure I understand the idea
[23:54:21] <alphamule> remuxing?
[23:54:57] *** darkapex_ is now known as darkapex
[23:55:19] <furq> right
[23:55:38] <furq> you just set the timestamp of every frame from the file
[23:55:55] <furq> you can change frame timings like that with ffmpeg, just not per frame as far as i know
[23:59:00] <alphamule> Oh, because the touch method looked painful
[23:59:08] <alphamule> And not supported everywhere
