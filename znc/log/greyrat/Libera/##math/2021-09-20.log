[01:14:13] <river> and by ^ you mean intersection?
[01:14:21] <cuppajoeman> Yes
[01:14:39] <[itchyjunk]> argh. say i have f:C->C and I am looking at Re(f) and Im(f). so i should be looking at u(x,y):R^2 -> R and v(x,y):R^2 -> R
[01:14:39] <river> so we can replace A ^ B ^ C with X actually
[01:14:51] <river> we just need to show  P(X) = sum{x in X) P({x})
[01:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> but my u(x,y) is equation of a hyperbole
[01:15:08] <river> then set X = A ^ B ^ C to get what you wanted
[01:15:23] <river> and certainly X = union{x in X} {x}
[01:15:53] <river> so P(X) = P(union{x in X} {x}) = sum{x in X) P({x}) as long as each {x} is a disjoint event
[01:15:56] <cuppajoeman> It holds by the last clause of the probability measure def
[01:16:16] <cuppajoeman> But my goal was to use the other proof if possible, which has to do with number of elements in sets

[01:20:11] <[itchyjunk]> i have a function f:C->C and i am asked to graph is for some gives constraint where it says real part is between so and so and im part is between so and so
[01:20:19] <cuppajoeman> Yeah, I think I'll have to go inductively, like in the function zmod sent, oh well
[01:20:21] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: it's not directly usable unless every single {x} has the same probability and there just finitely many things in the big union you are working on.
[01:20:32] <cuppajoeman> Right
[01:20:40] <[itchyjunk]> f(z) = z^2 so without the ocnstraint, all of C gets mapped to all of C
[01:21:04] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: sure, *every* nonconstant polynomial function sends C onto all of C -- this is the FTA
[01:21:30] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[01:21:52] <river> wow :D
[01:21:57] <Z-module> because  p(z) = w    has a solution z  (where p is a nonconstant polynomial, w is some complex value) iff the polynomial q(X) = p(X) - w   has a zero in C.
[01:24:28] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: but if you are restricting to  a < Re(z) < b  and   c < Im(z) < d,  then you're merely looking at the image of the rectangle  (a,b) x i*(c,d)
[01:24:56] <Z-module> which will be some bounded set as long as the function's domain contains the closed rectangle

[01:29:16] <bobb_> Hi, how is B calculated from [K, L, C] in https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3250537 ?
[01:29:29] <Z-module> [itchyjunk], you're reminding me of a thing I learned yesterday. Apparently Baker (the famous transcendental number theory guy) proved, as a lemma toward something else, that if f is a transcendental entire function (such as exp), and if U, V are two disjoint simply connected domains (= nonempty connected open sets in the plane), then at least one of f^-1(U), f^-1(V) is disconnected. But a 2018 arxiv paper disproves this, and in fact
[01:29:29] <Z-module> for  f(z) = exp(z) + z  there are pairwise disjoint simply connected domains U_1, U_2, U_3, ... where every  f^-1(U_n) is connected.
[01:30:09] <Z-module> So even the great Baker was capable of fucking up. It's humbling.
[01:31:04] <bobb_> i mean, the answer says how A is calculated by sqrt(K^2 + L^2) but says no word about B. Is it that obvious?
[01:31:07] <[itchyjunk]> oh that's nice to know that archive has such stuff on it

[02:53:09] <Z-module> (each of those is the negative of the other, of course)
[02:53:37] <yashi> We know that 2sqrt(xy) <= x+y. Is there also lower bound on xy in terms of x+y assuming x >= 1, y >= 1 e.g.?

[02:56:54] <[itchyjunk]> ah so i was vaguely on the right track
[02:57:07] <[itchyjunk]> but i dont think i would have been able to graph that either.. or write down the set
[02:57:22] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: maybe they'd be happy with:  { z = x + iy :  1 <= x^2 - y^2 <= 2  and  4 <= xy <= 9 }
[02:58:00] <Nickssen11> is there any reason why the 2nd bessel function would need an "i" here? https://imgur.com/a/zDfKPbf

Enlarge cherim's thing to:  {e^(i n) : n in N} cup {e^(i(sqrt(2) + n)) : n in Z}, with f being rotation by 1 radian as before.  Those two sets are disjoint, and sends the second set onto itself.

[03:22:44] <Z-module> You need g to be bounded away from 0 in some open set U around z_0, so that 1/g is bounded in U
[03:24:11] <Z-module> oh, I was working too hard: g continuous, and g(z_0) != 0 suffices

[03:49:29] <Z-module> so with g nonzero in open U around z_0, then f(z)/g(z) = M(f(z), I(g(z)) on all of U, where M is complex multiplication which is continuous, I is complex inversion (of nonzero numbers) which is continuous, so this composition of continuous things is continuous on all of U, but you only needed it to be continuous at z_0 in particular, to conclude that the limit is  M(f(z_0), I(g(z_0))) = f(z_0)/g(z_0)

[06:42:16] <Nickssen> i will try to find it in my notes, i only saw it in a table

[06:44:05] <somiaj> if so, you might not get anywhere with that theorem. But from my quick glance, I think in this case no, because to me int_0^inf sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt is not going to be defined for any s>0 since near t=0, that function behaves like 1/t, and int_0^a 1/t dt is divergent for all a>0

[06:47:38] <Nickssen> right
[06:47:46] <Nickssen> now i need to try to integrate that

[06:53:52] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.77.129)
[06:55:32] <Nickssen> alright so
[06:55:35] <somiaj> to me it is way harder to notice int_s^inf (pi/2 - arctan(x)) dx is divergent, vs noticing int_0^inf sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt is divergent
[06:55:40] <Nickssen> right
[06:55:56] <Nickssen> for the easier method, then i should try to take the limit of the integrand as x->0 right?
[06:56:17] <somiaj> which makes it a 'nice' hard question, to see if students pay attention to definitions, or just try to churn though the table
[06:56:29] <somiaj> so lesson, always think weither or not the lapalce transform integral is convergent.
[06:56:59] <somiaj> Yea, since sin(t)/t^2 has a vertical asymptote at t=0, the improper integral has two issues
[06:57:27] <Nickssen> ahhhh
[06:57:45] <somiaj> so int_0^inf sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt = lim a->0 int_a^b sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt + lim c->inf int_b^c sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt
[06:57:57] <somiaj> you have to have a single limit per issue, and the vertical asymptote causes one
[06:58:27] <somiaj> now here you can kinda guess, sin(t) ~ t for t close to zero, which is enough to guess that it is most likely divergent
[06:58:31] *** Quits: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.77.129) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:58:41] <Nickssen> sin t has one "x" to spare in its power series expression
[06:58:45] <Nickssen> one "t"
[06:58:49] <somiaj> you could probably formalize this, might depend on what the prof wants, though I think if it was me, students able to notice that the integral is divergent is good enough
[06:58:53] <Nickssen> so it can cancel out sint/t but not sint / t^2
[06:59:36] <somiaj> though on the other hand sin(t)/t^(3/2) would have a laplace transform
[06:59:44] <somiaj> but might not be one that is easy to compute

[07:02:00] <Nickssen> will the weighing function e^-st never be able to repair that?

[07:03:00] <somiaj> Nickssen: no, e^(-st) won't help with vertical asymptotes no matter where they are at for t=a >= 0
[07:03:28] <cherim> Your sin(t)/t^(3/2) has a vertical asymptote, what's there to repair?
[07:04:04] <somiaj> that helps with the tail, so it gives laplace transforms to any function that doesn't grow faster than all possible exponential functions
[07:04:04] <Nickssen> just a doubt , wondering if it could squish things down
[07:04:27] <somiaj> it won't, and if you look at a laplace transofrm, t^p only has a transform for p>-1
[07:05:30] <somiaj> but vertical asymptotes are not something the e^(-st) helps with, and only some functions with them will have a laplace transorm (provided the improper integral converges near the asymptote)
[07:05:54] <Nickssen> perfect
[07:06:06] <Nickssen> lastly and srry for a stupid question on this same issue
[07:07:10] <Nickssen> when I want to prove formally that i can't integrate sint/t^2, im saying that the limit x->0 sinx/x^2 =  lim cost/2t = lim -sint/2  through l'hopital
[07:07:24] <Nickssen> but -sint/2 is different on left and right and therefore the limit doesn't exist

[07:07:59] <cherim> No

[07:08:15] <cherim> lim cost/2t is not L'Hospital
[07:08:27] <cherim> And lim -sint/2  actually has no issues
[07:08:47] <somiaj> you have to prove that lim a->0 int_a^b sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st) dt is infinity
[07:08:51] <somiaj> here b>0
[07:10:13] <Nickssen> wait, using series i can prove that lim x->0+ sint/t^2 is infinity
[07:10:26] <Nickssen> would that be enough to prove that the integral will be divergent?
[07:10:26] <somiaj> I think limit comparision can work here, compute the lim t->0 (sin(t)/t^2 e^(-st)) / (1/t) = lim t->0 (sin(t)/t * e^(-st)) = 1*1 = 1 != 0 (and is finite)
[07:11:02] <somiaj> so due to limit comparision since int_0^1 1/t dt diverges, so does the previous integral (though I'm a bit unsure if you can use limit comparsion near vertical asymptotes)
[07:11:11] <somiaj> Nickssen: yes, that is the whole goal

[07:23:23] <droid3> Would have thought the SAT/SMT problems would be more for a programmers irc topic.
[07:24:29] <droid3> But i have to ask it here because most of it stems in the subjects of mathematics or logic.
[07:26:00] <droid3> Boole in the 1800's figured out a way to systematically analyzes  logical expression/arguments and as a consequence was able to apply it to set theory using boolean algebra or to circuit analysis for shannon and others in the future
[07:26:51] <droid3> What i am wondering on is nearly any sat problem i want to solve i can solve in a reasonable amount of time using boole algebra and checking that the expression isnt identically 0 when reduced.
[07:28:02] <droid3> I am kind of wondering when /where in practice does it get to complicated to convert a sat problem into a boole algebra problem and simplify it.
[07:29:07] <droid3> Simplification of booles expressions are all just mod 2 polynomial arithmetic and even simpler x^2=x idempotent rule means all powers can be canceled.
[07:29:31] <droid3> So the boole reduction goes pretty quick for arithmetic computations.
[07:30:25] <droid3> The only issue becomes that when converting the problem from boolean algebra , logic , or set theory into the equivalent boole expression thats when variables get enlarged.
[07:31:12] <droid3> But since you can simplify partially at each step of function composition that can be cut down with alot of tricks very fast.

[07:33:44] <droid3> maybe its a bad analogy but like to talk on boole algebra vs boolean algebra and the SAT/SMT problem.

[18:26:22] <rubiksdream> im leaning towards the former, because the latter definition seems like it is too general for applications

[19:06:44] <riv> rubiksdream, I think a uniformly convergent product means, if you take log you get a uniformly convergent sum

[19:09:15] <lok91> But basically, the black box... it makes sense that alpha = alpha/2 + alpha/2, but why is it useful to split it like that? To me, alpha seems simpler.

[19:10:24] <lok91> And why is cos^2 alpha/2 = 1 - sin^2 alpha/2?
[19:10:37] <riv> if there is a zero factor the product is zero
[19:10:57] <riv> or maybe undefined
[19:11:17] <rubiksdream> hmm, I agree with you on the former thing you said
[19:12:02] <rubiksdream> it should always be defined if there is a zero factor, but I guess the reason we exclude zero factors, and go as far as to say that the product itself should not converge to zero, is that when we want an infinite product to represent a holomorphic function, we want to be able to read off its zeros from the zeros of the individual factors
[19:12:14] <rubiksdream> but we cannot do that if for some values, the product has non-vanishing factors, but vanishes

[19:17:06] <Z-module> it's a special case of  cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)

[22:06:59] <buster> When Frankel defines the exterior product (<https://ibb.co/qRF1nk2>) he says "KJ -> JK requires pq transpositions" (K,J are distinct p,q-tuples). It's easy to see that the parity of "KJ -> JK" is congruent to pq (mod 2), which is all that matters (since you apply a (p+q)-cycle, p times; and p(p+q-1)===pq (mod 2)). But I'm curious: is there an obvious combination of pq transpositions that bodily transposes K and J?

In the course, students are taught that (a) conservative vector fields are irrotational, and (b) on simply connected domains, irrotational vector fields are conservative. However, computing curls is an annoying chore, and then explicitly choosing a curve to integrate over it to find a potential is an even more annoying chore.
[23:00:03] <Z-module> but look, \mu is definitely an n x 1 thing (being mu_X in the top m entries, then mu_Y for the rest), so A\mu  in there does make sense.

[23:14:41] <cherim> First examples of closed / exact, and other bases are of Lame coefficients for other operators
[23:15:21] <isekaijin> Right, I have to bite my tongue to not say “closed” and “exact”.

[23:17:39] <isekaijin> I do not go actively looking for them. Between TAing and writing a master's thesis (and wasting half of the time I am supposed to do those playing Arknights instead), I barely have enough time to do recreational mathematics or recreational anything else.
[23:18:36] <captain_awesome> Without math... There would be no computers?
[23:18:56] <isekaijin> Right.
[23:19:41] <Vornicus> before electronic computers were human computers: rooms full of women whose job it was to do a lot of mathematical calculations
[23:20:06] <CuriousErnestBro> masters students can TA?
[23:20:20] <CuriousErnestBro> oh right they can
[23:20:23] <captain_awesome> Yeah... I've checked that out Vornicus

[23:32:30] <isekaijin> Maybe. I will be a terrible teacher no matter how much experience I get, though.

[23:33:45] <qergle> there's innate teaching ability and learned teaching ability.
[23:34:01] <qergle> the latter can approximate the former with enough effort
[23:34:57] <qed> it is just after repeating the same course again and again you aske yourself shouldn't they know this already
[23:36:27] <isekaijin> I think part of the problem is that my goals differ from those of the professors. What I would like to convey is that most of this is calculus nonsense is actually very geometric, even physical. What the professors want to do is torture students as much as possible with long, boring computations.

[23:40:59] <qergle> the calculus issue is a complex one, you end up with tons of calculus (differential, integral, multivariate, ode, pde, etc) and students are like wtf, this math thing sucks.
[23:41:20] <Inline> and then you enter symmetry
[23:41:23] <CuriousErnestBro> they're gonna be teaching us stochastic integrals
[23:41:25] <CuriousErnestBro> I don't wanna
[23:41:27] <Inline> lol
[23:41:36] <qergle> but engineering departments and physics departments are traditionallty big clients of math departments, so you sell what people are buying.
[23:42:07] <CuriousErnestBro> something called the "ito integral", at least the martingales chapter was fun
[23:42:16] <qergle> ito process!
[23:42:21] <qergle> brownian motion. woot!
[23:42:30] <CuriousErnestBro> we're doing brownian motion this week
[23:42:35] <qergle> or did i mean ito's lemma
[23:42:49] <CuriousErnestBro> the prof is doing something with finite dimensional distributions
[23:42:59] <CuriousErnestBro> some useless maths stuff to "be complete" I guess
