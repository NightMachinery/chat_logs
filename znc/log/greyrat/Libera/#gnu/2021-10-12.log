[20:56:12] <wodemoncafe> rindolf: Ok, so.. Let's say there's this programmer, Joe, and he writes a bunch of.. oh I don't know.. Lisp. He writes a hundred thousands of some Lisp for distributed computing or something. And Joe doesn't release his code to the public because ti's not yet ready for public consumption, but he licenses it. GPL as an example...
[20:56:13] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[20:58:17] <wodemoncafe> Joe uploads his code into a private GitHub repo, and somehow somebody gets read access to the code, either he shared the repo or the project with someone and they got hacked and someone steals the code and removes all the GPL licensing info, and this malicious actor begins selling the code, and passing it off as their own.
[20:59:46] <wodemoncafe> With a commercial license, and all traces of the GPL license and Joe's name removed, if Joe is able to prove he GPL'ed the code prior to this malicious actor coming into the picture, either by means of a dated picture or video, or making the Github repo public, would that be legally enforceable?
[21:00:46] <wodemoncafe> In other words, would Joe have any chance in court to force the malicious actor to stop selling his code, if he has proof that the code was GPL and he was the original author?
[21:03:14] <strajder> it wouldn't make much sense to write GPL-ed code and not publish it
[21:03:49] <wodemoncafe> Perhaps, but whether it makes sense is not the bone of contention :P
[21:04:26] <rindolf> wodemoncafe: i think Joe could [IANAL tho]
[21:06:06] <wodemoncafe> rindolf: Same unfortunately (Re: IANAL), but I have a second question about if the scenario is slightly different...
[21:10:58] <wodemoncafe> I considered going to law school before I became a developer, and who knows what the future holds? But back to the question, hypothetically suppose that the "malicious actor" incident never took place, and the only person who has ever seen this code is Joe, becuase he wrote it. And suppose that Joe keeps hacking on this code in private, and decides he would rather release the source under a different license, like BSD.
[21:11:44] <wodemoncafe> If Joe changes the license before ever making the code public, does that mean the code was never actually GPL because that version of the code was never released?

[21:16:33] <yrk> wodemoncafe: there would be a court process, and in that process github would get a subpoena to produce their records about the private record
[21:17:12] <yrk> wodemoncafe: joe would show that the code was uploaded by them using that process, and the bad actor would probably have to settle out of court (if they are smart)

[21:18:44] <yrk> wodemoncafe: even if joe didn't upload to a private repo, they could still work with their lawyers to provide evidence to the court that joe wrote that code first by presenting joe's drives, backups, internet searches, etc.
[21:19:35] <yrk> wodemoncafe: this isn't special to programming; the exact same process would happen if joe was a playwrite and trying to prove that they had written a manuscript that consequentially got stolen or otherwise misappropriated
[21:19:54] <wodemoncafe> yrk: Thank you for the response, that's a brilliant answer to the first question.
[21:19:59] <wodemoncafe> Any thoughts on the other question?
[21:22:15] <rindolf> wodemoncafe: does the git history carries copies under the gpl?
[21:23:56] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:23:58] <yrk> wodemoncafe: a copyright license has no meaning to joe; none at all. copyright is a goverment-granted exclusive property right. joe is granted exclusive rights to his work and needs to license. a copyright license of any sort only has meaning the moment joe distributes a copy of the work to a different copyright entity (person, company, contractor, etc.)
[21:24:22] <wodemoncafe> Let's say hypothetically yes, but it's a private repo, only Joe knows about its existence, the bad actor never gets the code. And then Joe takes the code himself and switches the license to BSD, and uploads it to a new public repo.
[21:26:07] <yrk> wodemoncafe: there is a limited way in which there was a copyright transaction: the upload to a company like microsoft^H^H^H^H^Hgithub, to the so-called "private" repo. the terms of that upload is governed by the terms of service of said company. you know, the terms of service joe read with extreme care and understood to the letter...
[21:27:01] <wodemoncafe> Yes, every letter >_> Twice just to make sure I understood it.
[21:27:17] <wodemoncafe> And the law degree I got to decipher the legalese of it <_<
[21:27:19] <yrk> wodemoncafe: so the short answer to the second question: copyright licenses apply to copyright transactions; no copyright transaction, no way to apply a copyright license
[21:28:54] <yrk> wodemoncafe: when Jane Code downloads a copy of joe's code from his new public repo, there will be a copyright transaction and she will be able to do with that code whatever the license said. beforehand, the question is moot

[21:29:50] <wodemoncafe> But then how can Joe seek legal recourse against "malicious actor"?
[21:30:24] <yrk> wodemoncafe: because there was a transaction. joe has exclusive rights to the work, and the actor doesn't
[21:31:31] <yrk> wodemoncafe: the question is always: under which terms did you get your specific copy
[21:32:24] <yrk> wodemoncafe: it doesn't matter if later on a copy was made available under different terms. stealing a car that was going to be given away for free the next day is still theft
[21:32:47] <yrk> wodemoncafe: it is the _owner's_ exclusive right to give that car away. the transaction in which the car was stolen is the one that will be judged.

[21:40:34] <wodemoncafe> Ok reading the FAQ answer, if Jane steals Joe's backup CD of the code, suppose she takes it, removes all license and author info, and sells it to Initech, inc.? Jane gets 5 million dollars for it, and moves to a country that doesn't extradite to the US. Initech begins selling this new copy of the code, Joe recognizes the GUI he buit and functionality he implemented, and he doesn't know how the code got leaked, but he takes legal action against Initech 
[21:40:36] <wodemoncafe> anyway. Then what happens?
[21:40:56] <wodemoncafe> Sorry if it's getting too far down a rabbit hole.
[21:41:19] <yrk> wodemoncafe: it's the same question though
[21:42:21] <yrk> wodemoncafe: joe's job is still to prove to a court that 1. they are the author, 2. that they had no intention of releasing the code that way, 3. they have been damaged as a result

[21:45:56] <yrk> wodemoncafe: it doesn't actually have anything specific to do with the GPL
[21:45:57] <wodemoncafe> If Jane got paid $5 million for the code that Joe wrote, is Initech on the hook to pay Joe the $5 million since it's his code and Joe can't legally pursue Jane because she's disappeared?

[21:49:27] <wodemoncafe> So you're saying yes, Initech would be liable for damages if they bought and sold Joe's code, even if they had proof that they bought it from Jane and had no idea it belonged to Joe, and Jane has vanished?
