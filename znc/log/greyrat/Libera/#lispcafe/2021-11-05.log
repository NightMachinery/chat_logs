[08:06:23] <gilberth> Don't Lisp implementations using UTF-16 for their strings somehow violate the assumption that a string is a sequence of characters?
[08:08:35] <gilberth> I mean, for really portable code, do I have to cope with string encoding now? That's silly. And will that never stop? Can't we just use Unicode and be set?
[08:10:41] <dave0> isn't utf-16 a variable-length code?
[08:11:09] <gilberth> Yep. That's the trouble.
[08:12:08] <dave0> are we for variable-length codes (so why not use utf-8) or are we against it (so why not use a 32 bit integer)
[08:14:28] <moon-child> I bet most places that are utf-16 today originally wanted to be ucs2, before we realised that 65536 characters is not enough for everybody!
[08:16:54] <dave0> when would you say unicode got carried away with itself? i'd argue it wasn't the poop emoji even though it's a bit excessive

[08:19:11] <moon-child> my impression is the emoji are primarily a marketing vessel to make sure the big corps support new versions of unicode which support new languages
[08:20:05] <gilberth> moon-child: Yes. My Closure is that way. At that time UCS-2 was suffice. I faced seven bit characters with Lisp and used vectors of (unsigned-byte 16) as a string. Called then ROD and define a reader macro like #"hello" for them. And had another reader macro #/a for "runes".
[08:20:44] <gilberth> I decided against a variable length encoding and needed to use integers for characters.

[08:22:48] <dave0> jar, jar, sun, man facing right, jar, wiggly lines
[08:24:43] <gilberth> At that time Unicode faced a political issue too. UCS-2 was too small for both Japanese and Chinese glyphs, so they were assigned the same code points for the same glyphs. In consequence neither nation felt like being considered.
[08:25:12] <gilberth> Oh dear. Wake me, when I could retire my RUNE abstraction.
[08:25:40] <dave0> if you were a font making guy, a million characters is a fair bit to draw
[08:26:17] <dave0> oh google says there's 143,859 characters

[11:18:29] <gilberth> Sigh. My cousin needed to send some document by email. His flatbed scanner produces huge colourful jpegs and the resulting email got bounced because it was weighting somewhat like 80MB. Using good old netpbm tools and ImageMagick got me a 1.2MB PDF to send. And pages are deskewed, too. So much for that.
[11:20:27] <dave0> i had forgot about netpbm
[11:21:26] <dave0> they're a real nice toolbox
[11:21:49] <gilberth> I like those tools and they are also handy to read or generate all sorts of image file formats from Lisp.
[11:22:40] <dave0> once at school a friend of a friend was saying something like they had to write a program to produce a ppm file and i said portable pixmap and the guy said "how did you know that?"
[11:23:05] <dave0> ppm is like unix version of bitmap
[11:23:12] <dave0> bmp i mean
[11:23:18] <dave0> windows bmp
[11:25:44] <gilberth> The file format is trivial. It also happens that the bit order matches the bit order of the CADR frame buffer. So I mmap the frame buffer to a file, with the first page being the PBM header. So there is a live image file of the CADR frame buffer at the file system. :)
[11:25:51] * hayley got a sore throat from trying to record a video for a university assignment, goes onto gmod and finds more people from university.
[11:26:03] <gilberth> I presume that .bmp is more complicate than the netpbm format.

[11:28:14] <gilberth> Although not netpbm per se. But I read JPEG files from Lisp with spawning djpeg. Turns out, that this isn't any slower than to FFI into libjpeg, which is no fun at all.

[11:28:35] <gilberth> And doing it this way makes Lisp survive random buffer overflows. :)
[11:29:10] <dave0> gilberth: one thing i seem to remember is .bmp's are upside down :-p
[11:29:21] <sham1> That's actually a neat tool considering it outputs the image data to stdout
[11:29:48] <gilberth> dave0: OpenGL and Cocoa are also upside down.
[11:30:45] <hayley> BMP wasn't that hard, but indeed it is upside-down.
[11:31:19] <sham1> Either reading it and then flipping the buffer, or reading it from end to start. Either way, not fun
[11:31:27] <hayley> Now that my throat doesn't hurt, I guess I should record (and hopefully not fuck it up this time). And then try prefetching in SBCL again.
[11:31:29] <gilberth> And the "recent" PAM format has the alpha channel, too. No need to keep separate masks.
[11:31:30] <sham1> I really don't understand why Microsoft chose it this way
[11:31:56] <gilberth> Depends. As I said Cocoa and OpenGL like their bitmaps upside down.
[11:32:24] <gilberth> shma1: Where is (0,0) with GDI? Upper-left or lower-left?
[11:32:31] <hayley> Though I wouldn't be surprised if prefetching in vectors doesn't help, and I really should be prefetching on heap_scavenge. But I can't do that, because SBCL only lets you find the size of an object by scavenging it. Hence no useful prefetching.

[12:24:27] * hayley looks up the term "regex super-optimization"
[12:24:42] <hayley> "an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time" The parens are doing a lot there.
[12:24:55] <hayley> "It's up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in" Did you enable the JIT?
[12:28:51] <gilberth> Still greping?
[12:30:15] <hayley> Yes.
[12:30:47] <hayley> But I think subjecting the "JIT" code to a nearly proper register allocator and compiler should be called a super-optimizer, relatively speaking.
[12:30:48] *** childlikempress is now known as moon-child
[12:31:14] <gilberth> I figure that for greping and submatch addressing, as you expect a lot of noise, it could be faster to post-pone register assignment until one has a match. So when you factor that part out of the equation and run the state machine without register assignments (but the overall match start),¬† you won't perhaps be hurt by CL compile time that much.
[12:32:36] <hayley> I got some slow compilations without submatches.
[12:33:14] <hayley> But then again, I am isum-less still, so it could have been that compiling [a-z]+@[a-z]+.[a-z]+ did a lot of unnecessary DFA construction work.
[12:34:17] <gilberth> Oh dear. You really want to compute the equivalence classes.
[12:34:45] <hayley> I do compute equivalence classes, as per Owens et al.
[12:35:23] <gilberth> Do they use an interval sum representation?
[12:36:04] <hayley> It's not described in the paper. Recall I've only read the papers, not source code.
[12:36:18] <hayley> And, amusingly, it's still SBCL being slow and not DFA generation. sigh
[12:36:19] <gilberth> What happens if I say [a-\U0001F893]?
[12:36:50] <hayley> Oh, right, the isum means that SBCL doesn't have to fold (or (char= c #\a) (char=b c #\b) ...) too.
[12:36:51] <gilberth> I never read Owen's source code.
[12:37:13] <gilberth> You emit a 26 element OR clause?
[12:37:23] <hayley> Yes.
[12:37:27] <gilberth> Have you read the re2c paper?
[12:37:35] <hayley> No.
[12:37:51] <hayley> If I read it, will submatching in my compiler still work?
[12:38:01] <gilberth> About an open-coded binary search as I do it, is faster than a table lookup.
[12:38:49] <gilberth> hayley: He describes dispatch and open coding things. re2c compiles REs (without submatch addressing of course) to C code running the DFA.
[12:39:01] <hayley> Right.
[12:40:13] <gilberth> But this may be more relevant to a scanner. idk. A scanner faces a way larger overall RE than a greper.
[12:41:29] <hayley> Right, so re2c does the length inference too
[12:42:08] <gilberth> My isums came first into use for CLEX-1.5. CLEX1 would happily just enumerate the 256 characters there are. With Unicode this is not practical anymore.
[12:42:37] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, re2c does, and it's clever. I told you.
[12:42:55] <moon-child> can still do table lookup. assume ascii, top 128 entries -> fallback
[12:43:10] <moon-child> depends on what you're using it for exactly ofc
[12:43:12] <sham1> Iterating over the 70 000 unicode codepoints shouldn't be a problem at all /s
[12:43:29] <gilberth> moon-child: Don't. Just don't. We have 2021, forgot?

[12:44:44] <gilberth> flex(1) compresses table by first mapping a character to its equivalence class and then go with that code into the DFA table. This results into smaller tables and would be feasible with Unicode also.
[12:45:39] <gilberth> As the number of equivalence classes aren't really larger, when you consider the gazillion other code points for letters like you did with [a-z] in 7-bit times.
[12:47:00] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@h-98-128-228-119.NA.cust.bahnhof.se)
[12:48:13] <gilberth> But then unless you grow larger than the cache, dispatching on the per state equivalence classes instead of over the overall equivalence classes, would be faster perhaps. At least in my application, where you want to quickly skip over say white space or when reading a string constant for example up to the next "\" or """.

[13:21:15] <Gnuxie> weird flex but ok
[13:21:46] <gilberth> With a real scanner for C and real C sources, including all the header files. Which was my application at that time.
[13:23:46] <gilberth> However to chose to use an EOF sentinel in the buffer.
[13:24:37] <hayley> Given that we also inline BMH or SIMD scan in one-more-re-nightmare, calling it a super-optimizer doesn't feel too wrong. Except then Hyperscan still exists, and is probably faster but lacks submatching.

[13:33:55] <gilberth> What we call radioactive waste, isn't actually waste, but could be "burned" further with breeder reactors. So it's fuel not waste. And I find it very curious that we care about this minature volume of radioactive waste, given that we have way more chemical waste, which also could very nasty. But the latter we happily hide in huge quantities somewhere and don't talk about it at all.

[15:56:44] <sham1> Every character can be a Unicode codepoint

[16:02:00] <dave0> UTF-63/3

[16:03:24] <dave0> sham1: can i steal your idea?
[16:03:29] <sham1> sure
[16:03:37] <sham1> Including the paroty
[16:04:13] <sham1> That is a rather nice typo though, since its Levenshtein distance from parity is 1, and of course i and o are next to each other
[16:06:06] <dave0> it's a real nice memory trade-off
[16:06:27] <dave0> 21 bit char in 32 bit variable wastes 11 bits
[16:07:23] <sham1> Meanwhile 3 codepoint in 64 bits wastes only 1 bit, which can be parity or whatever. It's nice compression, although of course getting the codepoints can be annoying
[16:08:22] <sham1> Well, not compression but utilizing the word very efficiently
[16:11:08] * hayley wants to compute entropy to tell if some fancy substring search algorithm is a good idea or not.
[16:12:08] <dave0> sham1: what do we call it?
[16:12:44] <dave0> hayley: can you add sham1's idea to your regex program?
[16:13:52] <sham1> Well it's just dense unicode innit
[16:14:24] <hayley> Just add a new AREF function which reads and destructures the word.
[16:18:25] <gilberth> In B "char" was a function to pull a 6-bit character from a vector of 18-bit words.
[16:20:04] <gilberth> Maybe this is where CL:CHAR comes from? Who knows?
[16:25:17] <sham1> Speaking of chars, I've been experimenting with some Common Lisp while knowing absolutely nothing, is there a library that portably can go between whatever the native strings are and UTF-8 encoding which I could then put down a wire

[16:26:42] <sham1> Great, that works
[16:29:21] <sham1> And I'll assume there's a octets-to-string there as well, so that's good

[23:37:01] <pl> selwyn: the most annoying thing for me with VR is that I can't use it without surgery :/
[23:37:09] <selwyn> oh dear
[23:39:14] <pl> I mean, my 3d vision is currently effectively recovered through equivalent of somewhat well trained ML model
[23:39:42] <pl> that still means I often have trouble with distances
[23:43:01] <selwyn> and surgery can fix that?
[23:43:15] <pl> selwyn: yep
[23:43:45] <pl> essentially my left eye has one or two muscles a bit broken
[23:44:17] <pl> this results in "drift" that gives me effectively strabismus and brain working overtime to correct the signal

[23:45:22] <pl> (fun fact - what we perceive as "vision" is actually a rather complex model-based reconstruction, eyes do not give equivalent of what we would consider uncompressed video stream)
[23:47:00] <shka> see: brainport
[23:48:09] <pl> I'm pretty sure I'm not unique in that, but I probably stumbled at under-documented IIRC V2 failure in human brain back in first year in uni when we went over vision pathways
[23:48:34] <pl> been 13 years since so I don't remember everything. Would have to find my textbooks
[23:50:26] <pl> (stumbled upon as "huh, apply the one we just discussed to slightly different area of visual modelling and you get a hypothesis for why I have 0% result on Ishihara plates")
[23:51:18] <pl> and you don't want to suck at those, because lazy doctors might declare you colour blind
[23:52:22] <pl> (ishihara plates are the drawings of many different coloured circles that you are supposed to find a pattern in)
[23:53:02] <selwyn> when we did laser safety they taught us about some of the visual damage you can get
[23:53:08] <ln43> ok, related to eyes me too have myodesopsias / floaters on one eye
[23:53:14] <selwyn> some scary types tbh
[23:53:23] <White_Flame> "Do not look into laser with remaining eye"
[23:53:25] <ln43> as a result of a hit... years ago 
[23:53:34] <selwyn> white_flame: lol
[23:54:01] <selwyn> if you damage the retina you can effectively create more blind spots
[23:54:11] <selwyn> because the brain is clever, it fills them in the same way
[23:54:27] <ln43> ok but the important thing is that brain get used to these objects that appears floating around
[23:54:34] <selwyn> but the result is that you see things that aren't actually there

[23:55:06] <ln43> so i not perceive the problem if don't focus on light sources
[23:55:21] <ln43> white mostly
[23:56:22] * selwyn learns about myodesopsia
[23:56:29] <selwyn> pretty sure i have had these my whole life..
[23:58:23] <selwyn> my favourite eye fact is that you can actually see cherenkov radiation in space
