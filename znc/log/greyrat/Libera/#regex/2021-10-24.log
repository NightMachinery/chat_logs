[11:25:59] <Disposeable-Nick> It's IRC protocol stuff.
[11:26:48] <Disposeable-Nick> I should mention, I have import re in script
[11:28:27] <Blondie101010> you should test and experiment on https://regex101.com/
[11:28:50] <Disposeable-Nick> So, ('(?i)^PING (:[^ ]+)$', text) | That searches for PING :, (PING whitespace colon), how do I make it, so it can look for 433.  That is 433 without a space or colon?
[11:28:58] <Blondie101010> put the regex you think you need with positive and negative test cases, then when you want to share it here, you click save and copy the link
[11:29:31] <Disposeable-Nick> I thoight it might be this at first, bit I was wrong:
[11:29:59] <Disposeable-Nick> ('(?i)^433([^ ]+)$', text)
[11:30:11] <Disposeable-Nick> Then, I had this, also wrong:
[11:30:30] <Disposeable-Nick> ('(?i)^433$ (:[^ ]+)$', text)
[11:31:42] <Disposeable-Nick> thought * but *
[11:32:42] <digitok> paste a sample line pls
[11:34:29] <Disposeable-Nick> ('(?i)^PING (:[^ ]+)$', text)
[11:34:35] <Disposeable-Nick> That is 100% working
[11:34:42] <digitok> paste a sample line of input pls
[11:36:47] <Blondie101010> Disposeable-Nick:  you should really use the site https://regex101.com/ as it tells you what means what when you hover with your mouse
[11:36:57] <Blondie101010> and you can show test cases
[11:39:28] <Disposeable-Nick> Honestly, I've no clue, if this is what you need or not https://regex101.com/r/vouue6/1
[11:39:45] <digitok> it isn't
[11:39:51] <Disposeable-Nick> Welp
[11:40:09] <Disposeable-Nick> I guess I did my best to explain.  I'll look elsewhere.
[11:40:12] <Disposeable-Nick> Cheers.

[11:40:26] <digitok> you've neglected to paste an example of the text you want to match
[11:41:06] <Disposeable-Nick> I just want to find 433, without the space colon.
[11:41:22] <Disposeable-Nick> Then, I'll move on to 375 and 376
[11:41:27] <Disposeable-Nick> That's all I need
[11:41:46] <digitok> you don't need regex to check if a string is exactly "443"
[11:41:53] <Disposeable-Nick> Yes, but
[11:42:05] <digitok> 433*
[11:42:07] <Disposeable-Nick> The way I currently have them, they can be triggered by others if said
[11:42:29] <Disposeable-Nick> Example, SOMETHINGHERE 433
[11:42:33] <Disposeable-Nick> That will trigger
[11:42:38] <Disposeable-Nick> 433
[11:42:45] <Blondie101010> The "Test string" section is to put lines that should and should not match to test the expression
[11:42:45] <Disposeable-Nick> standalone wll not
[11:42:58] <Blondie101010> so put those in the test box

[11:44:56] <Disposeable-Nick> If I did it like that, it won't trigger if someone said that then, digitok?
[11:45:28] <digitok> it will trigger if text contains 433 anywhere
[11:46:09] <Disposeable-Nick> With the paste example above, the way that is, only the server can trigger it, and not an individual in a channel
[11:46:33] <Blondie101010> what is the line that doesn't match?
[11:46:44] <Blondie101010> *that* is a test case you need to use

[22:19:30] <Blondie101010> re101-newt-49:  if your nginx log format is different than the nginx log format of the tutorial you're following, you consult the nginx documentation on how to change it...
[22:20:19] <Blondie101010> but if you want to work on the regex, you need to test it, so do a something on https://regex101.com/ then save it and share the URL
[22:23:12] <Blondie101010> so you'd be starting with something like https://regex101.com/r/yhIMDS/1
[22:23:56] <Blondie101010> considering that there is no match, because the expression has to be corrected, troubleshooting can be done by splitting the expression and examples in pieces
[22:24:21] <Blondie101010> ie: remove everthing after the date for example
[22:27:29] <Blondie101010> your log entries are missing quite a few fields that your regex is looking for
[22:31:17] <re101-newt-49> yeah i actually know that, because already testing on regex 101. but i dont know how to edit the regex '=(  . i just want someone fix the regex which can match with my log format
[22:32:42] <Blondie101010> the fields are not there
[22:33:35] <Blondie101010> that regex is quite human readable...  every field is named so you can follow it with a log line
[22:34:06] <Blondie101010> see what does not match or is missing, and whether it's important, or you have an alternative
[22:36:19] <Blondie101010> another difference is the tls tag in your log, so you just need to skip it (before the <method>)
[22:40:46] <re101-newt-49> oh how to skip?
[22:43:14] <Blondie101010> one way could be '.*' but there seems to be quite a few differences in format
[22:47:03] <Blondie101010> you'll need to handle the fact that http_referer and http_user_agent are not present, but without them the regex would be something like: https://regex101.com/r/yooKgX/1
