[01:39:22] <jiggawatt> nah 1GB is fine for normal usage

[01:39:56] <bookworm> with your usage pattern, yes
[01:45:36] <Snuupy> my thelounge instances takes ~300MB RAM
[01:45:41] <Snuupy> like 25GB of logs though
[01:48:30] <bookworm> it's a function of some base, plus number of networks and channel which scales with the number of users
[01:49:08] <bookworm> my single user instance uses X amount of memory is a pretty useless statement
[01:49:54] <bookworm> plus the scrollback setting, naturally
[01:54:01] <Snuupy> I'm in like, 60 channels, had to lower scrollback to 500 or something otherwise thelounge was going to nom all my ram

[18:26:27] <bookworm> reto being my znc user name
[18:26:40] <bookworm> libera the znc network name
[18:30:39] <gopher22> bookworm thank, you, that's pretty clear and straightforward! however I still get password mismatch when I reconnect... but my password is good (tried authenticating with znc with /quote pass ...)
[18:32:36] <bookworm> do you have funny symbols like quotation marks / spaces in the password? Maybe there's a problem with quoting somewhere
[18:33:08] <gopher22> none whatsoever, very simple password with letters and numbers only
[18:33:24] <bookworm> then what I showed you should work
[18:33:35] <bookworm> else it would be very hard for me to type this message ;)
[18:35:14] <gopher22> I've set it up the way as you showed in the screenshot, still password mismatch
[18:35:47] <bookworm> with the proper user name too?
[18:36:30] <bookworm> you should be able to increase the logging of znc and see the auth attempt, so maybe try that?
[18:36:58] <bookworm> last I saw it even dumps the password to the log, so it should be obvious what's going on
[18:36:58] <gopher22> yes, let me check that
[18:37:10] <bookworm> (debug logs mind you)
[18:37:37] <MaxLeiter> Is the ScoutLink team here? 
[18:39:42] <gopher22> as I mentioned if I leave the password blank in TL, and quote pass myname@mylcientid/mynetwork:mypassword this will work
[18:40:54] <gopher22> however if I ommit mypassword and quote myname@mylcientid/mynetwork , I will get "password mismatch" error. so could be that TL is "eating" the password field?
[18:41:31] <bookworm> what do the znc logs say?
[18:42:49] <bookworm> also, you did specify the password within TL in the *server* section yes? Same as my screenshot shows?
[18:43:39] <gopher22> bookworm Indeed I did it there, right under the server host/ip field
[18:44:24] <gopher22> in that case the "authentication" section can stay with "no authentication" option
[18:44:31] <bookworm> yes
[18:45:46] <gopher22> I will have to kim through ZNCs wiki, as I don't know where does the znc daemon on alpine linux keeps it's logs by default. certainly not stdout nor /var/log/messages
[18:46:48] <bookworm> you can simply start ZNC in the foreground with znc -D
[18:46:59] <gopher22> good call :)

[19:07:31] <gopher22> ok, this is strange, I can see something like this in the log when trying to connect the way you mentioned above: CLI -> ZNC [PASS mypassword] - I assume this is how ZNC daemon receives the PASS argument from TL, however this does not work
[19:10:20] <gopher22> but if I leave the password blank in TL and connect... I can see in the log: CLI -> ZNC [PASS myuserid@myclient/mynetwork:<censored>] and authentication works

[19:20:50] <bookworm> gopher22: what's your znc version?
[19:21:48] <gopher22> it is 1.8.2 running on Alpine edge
[19:22:24] <bookworm> so not a problem then
[19:22:34] <gopher22> (not docker, just plain Alpine in an LXC, but that shouldn't matter
[19:22:45] <bookworm> I'm looking at the code but unless your password goes over 300 chars it doesn't do anything special
[19:23:14] <gopher22> I assure you that the password is not >= 300 chars :)
[19:25:38] <gopher22> well I suppose it's not a biggie, but it would have been convenient to just connect using the given arguments. also Thelounge kind of defeats the purpose of an irc bouncer, right?
[19:28:17] <Geezabiscuit> If you're not relying on any ZNC plugins.
[19:28:59] <Geezabiscuit> Also having ZNC means if you need to restart thelounge you won't be disconnected from ant networks.
[19:29:38] <bookworm> that's also how it works... not sure what's going on on your setup
[19:30:14] <Geezabiscuit> You'd still suffer that if you need to restart ZNC of course. Depends on which you restart more often.

[19:30:40] <gopher22> fair points about ZNC. yes, perhaps it's a mismatch/incompatibility between versions TL v4.2.0 and ZNC 1.8.2
[19:30:54] <bookworm> no
[19:31:22] <bookworm> I am connected this way, there was no change in that part of the code
[19:31:56] <gopher22> does the ident server reply/spoofing gets a play in this maybe?
[19:32:23] <gopher22> I have oidentd running on the same host as thelounge and set up accordingly as per the guide
[19:33:04] <bookworm> pretty useless if you connect via znc (only connect via znc that is0
[19:33:07] <bookworm> )*
[19:33:11] <bookworm> but no it shouldn't
[19:34:29] <bookworm> if the password was fine in the znc logs, what does znc say that the user is?
[19:37:22] *** Joins: pekk4 (~pekk4@hati.uberspace.de)
[19:38:21] <gopher22> I can see the following: CLI -> ZNC [USER randomIDthingfromIdentServer 0 * ZNCusername@ZNCclientName/IRCnetworkThatImTestingNow]
[19:38:42] <gopher22> of course real data is replaced
[19:38:55] <bookworm> ok, that's had
[19:38:57] <bookworm> bad*
[19:39:05] <bookworm> so it is the identd?
[19:41:21] <gopher22> here is the /etc/oidentd.conf https://pastebin.com/rXm18zVH for reference
[19:41:46] <bookworm> USER randomIDthingfromIdentServer has to be USER $zncuser
[19:43:52] <gopher22> it's not a secret, if you a /whois on me, you can see that is the same Id in the host mask before the "@"
[19:44:39] <gopher22> that the Id I get from oidentd apparently
[19:44:59] <bookworm> yes, however that's bad as far as znc is concerned
[19:45:07] <bookworm> as ZNC uses this as your znc username
[19:45:12] <bookworm> that's your problem
[19:46:31] <gopher22> yes, according to the debug log, that's what is gets from TL if I set it up as you recommended. however , as I mentioned, it identifies me and connects fine if I just quote PASS ...
[19:46:57] <bookworm> sure, because you gave znc the username again
[19:47:53] <bookworm> or did you literally just write /quote PASS $password
[19:47:58] <gopher22> is it possible to just do quote the same command from the "commands" field in server preferences?
[19:48:07] <bookworm> without any of the usual zncuser:zncpass shenannigans?
[19:48:36] <gopher22> no, I quoted the whole shenaningans always :) else that wouldn't fly either
[19:48:39] <bookworm> I mean you can make your life easy, just specify user@phone/network:pass in the password field
[19:48:52] <gopher22> aaah
[19:49:44] <gopher22> ok, that worked instantly!
[19:51:40] <gopher22> so yeah, it's seems the ident forward thing messes this up
[19:56:09] <gopher22> oh, and now after I quit debugging ZNC and tried to start ir via rc-d it crashes for for apparent reason (haven't touched/opened the conf file). so yeah this issue is mostly realted to ZNC instead of TL
[19:56:59] <gopher22> nevertheless, thank you guys for your help and dedication to this!
