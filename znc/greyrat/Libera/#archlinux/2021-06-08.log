[00:03:01] <jonathon> i guess the "safest" way is to grab a currently-uninstalled package directly using `pacman -U`; at least that way it won't `-Sy` the local database. obviously not a great idea to do that to libraries, but you might get away with e,g, a browser or other more "standalone" application
[00:03:04] <mpan> Why not take the version that is compatible with your current system?
[00:03:14] <thurstylark> well, let's be clear here, by "not supported" that really just means at your own risk. If you understand the implications and able to get yourself back into supported range, then doing so is your decision. by the boundaries of this channel we can't really advocate for you doing that because it's coloring outside the lines, but ultimately they're your lines to color

[00:05:13] <mpan> madnight: you can always download a single package from a mirror and install it directly from the package file, if it’s only for a few hours before the evening comes. If it’s having no dependencies, it may work.
[00:05:23] <mpan> tusko: either borked mirror or you have installed a newer version.
[00:05:40] <teraflops> madnight: so cross fingers grab the package by curl or whatever and pacman -U it, if pacman complies about deps, go grab them and do the same over and over

[06:21:44] <jaawerth> I don't understand why it's like that. it's a pretty well-explored problem domain and you'd think there would be good rationale to make a tool that makes it intuitive to do the normal 5 or so operations people do with acl's

[06:52:34] <Entelin> in the AUR there are many packages that end with -git in addition to other similarly named packages without. What does that indicate? Which should I use?
[06:53:02] <NetSysFire> as always, it depends. -git usually means it builds the latest git version and not some stable version
[06:53:22] <sheep> -git means it's a development version that always builds with the latest revision from some git repository
[06:53:29] <smlavine> Some aur packages follow a version number and are only updated when a new release is made. -git packages tend to follow the master git repo and is less stable

[06:55:44] <Entelin> ok, yeah in the case of linphone theres a bunch (Out-of-date) / (Orphaned), a sysimage, and -git
[06:55:51] <jaawerth> at any rate, I only use -git packages for projects I contribute to or ones by authors I trust (2/3 of whom are people I know personally lol)

[06:56:52] <Entelin> *appimage rather
[06:57:13] <jaawerth> well ok I have been known to be lazy when the only alternative to a -git AUR pkg is an orphaned one that's already out of date
[06:57:56] <Entelin> is appimage a thing I should care about? 
[06:57:59] <jaawerth> it's fine if you're ok with the fact that you will have to explicitly update it and that updating it is going to be pretty prone to breakage
[06:58:18] <Repentinus> Could use jami instead? That's in official repos.
[06:58:20] <Entelin> I know what it is...  just not sure if I should ignore or care
[06:58:21] <jaawerth> yes, appimage means you can just grab a single binary and run it
[06:58:34] <jaawerth> it's great for things like nightlies, if you like that kind of thing, or if you want to just grab and try something
[06:58:45] <jaawerth> (I mean, assuming your'e comfortable running it on your machien without any isolation)
[06:59:23] <jaawerth> I use it for a few things where I want to using the bleeding edge version but it's a pain to compile from source
[06:59:25] <Entelin> ill checkout jami, I just need a sip phone
[06:59:37] *** Joins: JohnTitor (~teraflops@37.222.205.26)
[07:00:03] <jaawerth> anyway, -git can be fine, you just have to be ok with the instability of the updates and the fact that you'll have to do it explicitly
[07:00:19] <Entelin> I've used linux on servers for like 20+ years, but not on the desktop for the last 10 or so, felt the call to return lol
[07:00:31] <Repentinus> Entelin, welcome back.

[07:06:59] <gastondelar> Hello every1, I've been struggling with a driver / firmware issue on my new laptop for quite a while now and i've exhausted all the research paths i could think of. I even got some very educated insights in the forum but I still have no idea of what's going on. Any tips on how to continue? Should i contact the driver's devs, is that even a thing one can do ? The problem is with iwlwifi

[07:12:03] <gastondelar> longstory short, i'm dual booting with windows 10, (fast boot and hibernation are both off). While on arch iwlwifi  randomly crashes and it crashes the whole system with it, dmesg doesn't respond nor systemctl, nothig. After that neither OS can load the device anymore.

[07:14:46] <gastondelar> at first, powercycling the laptop would fix the thing, until it didn't anymore.

[17:35:49] <Repentinus> NTP is the correct thing. Make sure to sync the system clock to the RTC too and check that the drift rate is correctly recorded.
[17:35:50] <horseface> what have people got against systemd?
[17:35:57] <NetSysFire> horseface: please not again
[17:36:07] <BrainDamage> computer clocks are super shit, 5 min in 8h is no surprise
[17:36:12] <horseface> mainly on tcpdirect's irc congregation, they're all seem to be against it...
[17:36:17] <BrainDamage> ntp is pretty necessary

[17:36:48] <Repentinus> 5 min/8 h is by no means normal.
[17:36:53] <fluix> NetSysFire: "NTP service" is "inactive"
[17:37:15] <fluix> and what would be the appropriate journalctl command
[17:37:23] <NetSysFire> timedatectl set-ntp true is the invocation, i am no expert but 5 minutes/8h is not normal

[17:38:28] <NetSysFire> isnt it timesyncd?
[17:38:34] <NetSysFire> i wonder if it maybe the cmos battery failing
[17:38:39] <Repentinus> Oh, might be, let me check.
[17:38:47] <Repentinus> Yeah, it is.
[17:38:47] <fluix> neither has any journal entries
[17:39:06] <fluix> NetSysFire: wouldn't that real to RTC to skew instead of local time?
[17:39:07] <BrainDamage> ok, did a calc, 5 min is indeed tto much 8h/1s ⋅ 30⋅10^−6 gives approx 1s
[17:39:07] <Repentinus> Check `systemctl status timesyncd`.
[17:39:13] <fluix> *cause
[17:39:21] <fluix> s/real/cause
[17:39:33] <BrainDamage> and 30ppm drift is about the shittiest crystal you can buy
[17:39:44] <fluix> Repentinus: I don't have said service
[17:39:45] <NetSysFire> you could validate its not some sort of regression by using a liveiso of some sort for like 8 hours until its supposed to happen but this is more of a general troubleshooting and not clock specific
[17:39:49] *** Quits: horseface (~horseface@5.254.96.236) (Quit: Leaving)

[17:46:44] <fluix> or does it affect both?
[17:46:50] <Sout_> it affects the first boot time
[17:46:56] <niki> I once had an embedded device with ridiculous clock drift and i remember that chrony helped a lot with avoiding largee jumps in the system time compared to other NTP clients.. might be outdated info now though

[17:47:50] <NetSysFire> timesyncd is there by default though and requires very little config
[17:47:58] <BrainDamage> because it won't be counting from 1970 if the time resetts
[17:48:06] <fluix> and now I'm confused as to what the difference between RTC and local time is... so off to the wiki
[17:48:31] <BrainDamage> rtc is the time in the hw, localtime is the time in your country
[17:48:33] <MacGyver> BrainDamage: Usually mainboard won't count from 1970 anyway if they're out of juice.
[17:48:47] <BrainDamage> the two are not necessarily the same
[17:48:47] <MacGyver> I've seen things like 1998, 2002, 2005...
[17:48:48] <fluix> BrainDamage: I guess RTC vs "Universal time" is the more correct format
[17:48:50] <NetSysFire> in my case a reset will count from the latest bios update
[17:48:55] <NetSysFire> or s/bios/firmware/
[17:48:56] <Sout_> so rtc is the time set to the hardware module, local time is your date time, they can be synced or not. (there is also ntp / chrony time - which is utc and seperate from local time)
[17:48:59] <raster> i need to add a grue easter egg one day...

[17:49:30] <NetSysFire> should usually bet set to utc iirc
[17:49:34] <fluix> it's UTC that drifts

[17:50:08] <Elodin> BrainDamage: love your nick does it come from a song?

[17:50:14] <BrainDamage> also yes
[17:50:27] <MacGyver> I've always found it more sensible to set it to UTC and then beat Windows into submission using the registry.
[17:50:39] <MacGyver> Rather than tell Linux the time is "local", whatever that means.
[17:50:39] <Scimmia> UTC isn't something that's on your system, it's a universal standard. It doesn't drift

[19:41:21] <r3boot> Given that cp works sequentially ofc
