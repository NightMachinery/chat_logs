[22:32:21] <xMopx> does anyone know where you can buy small amounts of hvac air tubing? I cool a server room with a blower fan but i need to guide the air better 
[22:32:28] <xMopx> basically this stuff: https://smile.amazon.com/x/dp/B00TD6HZFU/
[22:32:37] <xMopx> but i just need like 12 feet, not 500 lol
[22:32:51] <xMopx> and im not going to cut up a bunch of trash bags.
[22:40:54] <sarnold> JTL :D ,bef
[22:56:04] <evilgohan2> bang.
[22:57:20] <evilgohan2> See you space cowboy.
[22:57:31] <joepie91> xMopx: lmao is that a $120 roll of PE
[22:58:08] <xMopx> it's a rolled up tube not just a sheet, yeah
[22:58:20] <xMopx> price seems absurd. 
[22:58:25] <joepie91> yeah it is
[22:58:30] <joepie91> also unsuitable for permanent installation
[22:58:48] <joepie91> PE does not handle prolonged heat well
[22:59:26] <joepie91> ah it actually even says that
[22:59:51] <joepie91> do you not have regular metal ducting or something there?
[23:00:34] <joepie91> ex. https://www.ventilatieshop.com/rechthoekig-kanaal-en-hulpstukken/instortkanalen-hulpstukken-170-x-70mm/rechthoekig-instort-kanaal-170-x-70mm-staal/
[23:01:04] <joepie91> or even just bog standard circular ducts if space is not a concern
[23:01:57] <joepie91> this is very common stuff here for example: https://www.ventilatieshop.com/spirobuizen-en-hulpstukken/spirobuizen-ventilatiekanaal/
[23:02:01] <joepie91> and pretty cheap
[23:03:11] <Allie> xMopx: tbh, go to the hardware store
[23:03:16] <Allie> get some spiral ducting
[23:03:57] <xMopx> joepie91: nah, just an apartment. West coast, my cpus have been suffering lol. I'd set it up just for heat waves
[23:04:18] <xMopx> which is why i'm interested in the lay-flat type

[23:13:15] <joepie91> hm, right
[23:13:22] <joepie91> xMopx: try a roll of vacuumsealer bag
[23:13:36] <joepie91> it's constructed functionally the same way as that 'flexible tubing'
[23:13:59] <joepie91> one long roll that's seamed/uninterrupted on the side but the ends of the thing as a whole are open, but no cross-seams inbetween
[23:14:15] <joepie91> as you're expected to create a seal on both sides with a vacuum sealer, at the desired size
[23:14:22] <xMopx> thats a good idea. Price is right too https://smile.amazon.com/x/dp/B08MPLY84K/
[23:14:26] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\_​ø< quack​!
[23:14:28] <sarnold> ,bef
[23:14:28] <unfinity> sarnold you befriended a duck in 2.347 seconds! You have made friends with 91 ducks in #datahoarder.
[23:14:29] <joepie91> ,bef
[23:14:30] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[23:14:32] <joepie91> aw
[23:14:43] <joepie91> xMopx: that's expensive even :D
[23:14:44] <xMopx> cheers
[23:14:49] <joepie91> but nowhere near as bad as the tubing lol
[23:14:53] <xMopx> lol true 
[23:15:04] <joepie91> oh they also have a 2 roll pack
[23:15:39] <xMopx> im sure those are a lot easier to find than hvac equipment 
[23:15:43] <joepie91> xMopx: the one you linked is sealed on both edges, so keep in mind that that'll be a bit less durable than a single constant tube
[23:15:56] <joepie91> leakage is more likely
[23:16:05] <xMopx> good point
[23:16:17] <joepie91> hold
[23:16:45] <joepie91> what
[23:16:50] <joepie91> why are all of them like that over there
[23:17:14] <xMopx> that they come with sealed edges instead of a loop?
[23:17:15] <joepie91> https://www.amazon.com/SKYGRAND-Freezer-Storage-Machine-Commercial/dp/B088QWKKRS/ref=pd_di_sccai_1/138-1494154-2957920 too
[23:17:17] <joepie91> yeah
[23:17:21] <joepie91> here the loop is standard
[23:17:42] <joepie91> anyway guess you're stuck with sealed edges then lol
[23:17:49] <joepie91> the one I linked is cheap and well-reviewed at least
[23:17:58] <joepie91> then again, it's amazon reviews, so who knows
[23:18:03] <xMopx> strange. I don't use one myself
[23:18:14] <xMopx> but i guess i have a reason to now, lol
[23:18:42] <joepie91> huh, the newer rolls sold here ALSO have sealed edges
[23:18:43] <joepie91> ???
[23:19:17] <joepie91> do they all get it from the same factory in china and they decided to change their design or something, lol
[23:19:33] <joepie91> well anyway, it's Probably Fine
[23:19:48] <joepie91> worst case you cut off a new strip
[23:19:54] <xMopx> its gotta be cheaper to produce sheets than a looped bit, even after doing the sealing
[23:20:14] <joepie91> I guess, I'm just curious why this changed all of a sudden

[23:22:33] <joepie91> xMopx: anyway, you won't need an actual vacuum sealer, to be clear :p
[23:22:40] <xMopx> haha yeah
[23:22:51] <xMopx> thanks for the links
[23:22:59] <joepie91> though they are useful at times
[23:23:05] <joepie91> 👍️
[23:24:16] <joepie91> xMopx: you know, I wonder if that roll of 'flexible tubing' is literally just vacuum sealer bag with a different label slapped onto it 🙃
[23:24:22] <joepie91> and a zero added to the price
[23:24:32] <joepie91> "it's HVAC now!"
[23:25:30] <xMopx> ive noticed that what i initially linked is also sold as a bagging option, though not marketed with vacuums
