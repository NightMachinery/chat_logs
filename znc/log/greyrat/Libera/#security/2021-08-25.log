[00:01:43] <catbeard> there's a bill passing, not sure if it's already been discussed in here but Iran's Protection Bill
[00:02:12] <catbeard> If pass, international tech companies will have to have a legal rep in Iran to comply with it's new laws
[00:02:29] <catbeard> but, if they are on the OFAC Sanctioned Countries list
[00:02:34] <catbeard> would that not apply?

[00:28:21] <ajak> vault is rather explicitly *not* single user, i thought?
[00:28:38] <ajak> if you're looking for a password manager there are far better ones
[00:29:31] <ska> Yes, but we're trying to run some code that has the choice of running in a large cluster, or on the local system. If we have to authenticate locally in a different way, we may have to write a lot of extra code.
[00:29:56] <ska> If we can run it locally in a secure way its a good deal for the developers.

[00:51:22] <jaggz> it was actually just looking up my own ip.  I'm silly and didn't recognize it since it was in the reverse in-addr.arpa form :}
[00:55:23] <catbeard> jaggz: the server does that lookup, so it will show their hostnames (PTR) to you, your client doesn't have to look that information up itself
[00:55:39] <catbeard> unless it's a DCC
[00:56:34] <catbeard> .in-addr.arpa host means you don't have an actual PTR with FCRDNS
[00:56:45] <catbeard> Forward-Confirmed Reverse DNS
[00:57:10] <catbeard> e.g. an irc bouncer with a vhost associated with the IP it's connecting from
[00:57:38] <catbeard> though usually in /who if the server can't resolve a PTR for the IP, it will just give you the IP
[00:58:15] <catbeard> or mask/cloak if that client has it enabled in usermodes or is applied from the gateway they connected to
[01:00:56] <catbeard> you could probably find out more about that in #libera-dev

[09:11:21] <catbeard> television has gone the way of the dodo and they know it
[09:11:38] <Hash> There is a good quote by someone but it's really long
[09:11:38] <catbeard> dodo: are you the last of them? lol
[09:11:47] <Hash> It will flood the channel if I paste :/
[09:12:58] <catbeard> we'll miss you but we'll forgive you
[09:13:10] <Hash> So, I'll say this, as a deeply psychedelic mental mad man...
[09:13:39] <Hash> Televion is the greatest drug par excellence.
[09:14:04] <catbeard> don't know what you want to watch? don't worry, TV will tell you what you want to watch
[09:14:33] <Hash> Average person in modern country watches television 4-6 hours a day.
[09:15:13] <catbeard> it sounds hazardous to say that i haven't paid for cable in 15 years
[09:15:30] <Hash> When you do so, blood pools in the nether regions, brain becomes dulled, in short, it exhibits many of the effects of drug addiction and intodixicatio
[09:15:34] <catbeard> so i'll just say i haven't watched cable in that long, not that i've had it and not paid for it
[09:15:49] <Hash> Consumption of culture is ... well
[09:16:03] <catbeard> i watch what i wanna watch, when i wanna watch it
[09:16:26] <Hash> Let me put it another way. We are just apes in the forest. Forest people. Monkey see, monkey do. We learn what to do by watching and watching leaves imprints and impacts on the brain
[09:16:35] <Hash> it also engages motor neurons in the brain and much more
[09:16:42] <catbeard> "What is that thing coming out of her nose?"
[09:16:48] <Hash> So, one should be careful of what one consumes or watches
[09:16:56] <Hash> Tevelvision in itself isn't evil or bad.
[09:16:58] <catbeard> "Spaceballs?!? Well, there goes the planet!"
[09:18:02] <Hash> One does not eat that which is toxic to oneself and detrimental.
[09:18:29] <catbeard> i've had waffle house
[09:18:31] <Hash> Consuming psychologically, why should one consume psychological food/content that is toxic or can be?

[09:20:30] <Hash> Again, because monkey see, monkey do

[14:20:03] <CoolerX> Hi
[14:20:11] <CoolerX> Anyone here used Keycloak? or UMA 2.0?
[14:20:27] <CoolerX> Is there a way to choose the resource id when you create a resource?
[14:21:44] <CoolerX> From the spec it seems the id is generated by the authorization server https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html#rfc.section.3.2
[14:21:50] <CoolerX> "Within the JSON body of a successful response, the authorization server includes common parameters, possibly in addition to method-specific parameters, as follows:
[14:21:51] <CoolerX> _id
[14:21:51] <CoolerX> REQUIRED (except for the Delete and List methods). A string value repeating the authorization server-defined identifier for the web resource corresponding to the resource. Its appearance in the body makes it readily available as an identifier for various protected resource management tasks."

[14:30:58] <CoolerX> 62 is + and 63 is /
[14:31:36] <CoolerX> DrSlony, it's possible that the strings you are getting are a small fragment of some larger strings

[22:13:53] <Hash> What do you mean 'now' and how exactly are sim/bank pin hacked?
[22:15:20] <piou> georgios: some real life attacks include not directly hacking the SIM but social engineering. Attackers have called service providers claiming for example to be away with no access to their mobile phone but awaiting a very important call and can you please redirect my calls to such and such numbers temporarily? Pretty please? And it worked and it probably will continue working for some time. So
[22:15:26] <piou> if you rely on codes sent by SMS I think using a separate phone whose number is harder to associate with you is not unreasonnable.
[22:16:46] <piou> georgios: I would not however recommend using an old phone if you can avoid it since old phones tend to not be supported anymore (this happens particularly often for mobile phones) so if you can have a decently new phone it's probably better than a 10yo brick.
