[00:51:02] <skye0> dutch black metal i found while trying to find montage music
[00:51:42] <skye0> it's licensed under a CC-BY-(SA?)-ND thing though so I can't use it for montages and the like, with the ND part
[00:53:55] *** Joins: jayray (~jayray@user/jayray)
[00:56:36] <ThePendulum> nice, the title seems to be a dialect
[00:56:37] <skye0> also another reason i want to move out is so i won't get into disputes with parents over energy and internet usage
[00:57:33] <ThePendulum> ah it's old dutch about a 1674 storm
[00:57:56] <skye0> that tore up a church that was left to ruins for several hundreds of years. can't speak dutch though, just read the description
[00:58:27] <ThePendulum> seems like it, in modern Dutch the title would be "de verschrikkelijke storm"
[00:58:35] <skye0> so many dutch people i came across in the past so far including here, surprising how i could barely come across dutch media, partly since i never deliberately looked for it
[00:58:39] <ThePendulum> hence I thought it was a dialect
[00:59:47] <ThePendulum> do you pay board money?
[00:59:55] <skye0> board money?
[01:00:06] <ThePendulum> like pay a mini rent to your parents
[01:00:23] <ThePendulum> I don't directly but they keep my healthcare subsidy
[01:00:39] <skye0> not really, i live here for free but my parents have serious financial issues to the point i've been asked to occasionally give them and my brother money. they've not paid me back; they can't pay me back
[01:01:07] <ThePendulum> hm right yeah if they owe you that's another story
[01:01:08] <skye0> been advised against moving out since the rent here starts at like 1000 GBP+ - with govt. programs, I found some cheaper places, but my brother, who's paying like half that just for rent is struggling to make ends meet (he's doing commission based work too, his studio keeps laying off people because of budget issues). he took out a credit card too. he lives and works in london but is coming over to our town for his break
[01:01:19] <ThePendulum> bloody hell
[01:01:41] <ThePendulum> do or can you work remotely?
[01:02:24] <skye0> i don't work remotely. i'm slightly concerned about my own performance at work too simply because i have only one other reason besides income to want to keep working there - some non-binary worker, whose very presence makes me feel glad i'm not the only one with gender issues at work
[01:03:03] <skye0> i keep making mistakes and i shouldn't. i want financial independence for as long as possible, don't want to go back to being unemployed or into temporary work. i want to move out ASAP too so then i can be a bit more open about my gender issues to everyone

[02:48:50] <Gaboradon> Hello
[02:49:42] <Gaboradon> Not a big deal and no problem, but I'm wondering how come WD drives as time moved on slowly stopped supporting various smart features. Are they simply too deep for any user to have any use of ...
[02:54:44] <Gaboradon> WD-20EZRX is WD 2TB Green from like 2014 or earlier don't remember, has Conveyance test, Offline surface scan, auto offline data collection, which a WD 4TB Red Plus WD-40EZRX does not have.
[02:55:01] <Gaboradon> The WD Green however does not support Statistics.

[18:18:21] <ThePendulum> skye0: ah right okay. I was a bit skeptical because two people were recommending Standard Notes in a thread about some other app and I thought it was an ad, lol

[18:28:05] <skye0> Fair ThePendulum. Not paid for it myself, but I'm just annoyed by how I can't find something that works on Windows, Linux and Android well until I came across Standard Notes. crypt.ee seems far cheaper and works about as well but I hate that it requires a browser
[18:30:36] <skye0> ThePendulum just remembered about this: https://www.etesync.com/
[18:31:38] <skye0> Only reason I'm not using it is because I want to be sure I'm not gonna get fired first before I throw money at even annual subscriptions for things I would end up needing
