[00:01:26] <programmerq> https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cpusets.html - those options pretty much get passed to the cgroup. I've never used mems personally, but I believe based on this documentation that it would be sane to set both cpuset-mems and cpuset-cpus to the same value

[00:04:14] <bencc1> "lscpu | grep -i numa" gives me: "NUMA node(s): 1"
[00:04:25] <bencc1> so maybe I don't have multiple ccx?

[00:12:09] <programmerq> I would guess that the numa nodes on most hardware would match the number of *sockets*
[00:12:26] <programmerq> so a multicore single socket processer may only have one numa node
[00:12:36] <programmerq> but again, I'm guessing and going on that doc. it sounds very hardware specific.
[00:13:11] <bencc1> ok. thanks
[00:13:44] <programmerq> I have a two socket system, and it has two numa nodes. The lscpu command seems to list out each CPU for each numa core.
[00:14:49] <programmerq> NUMA node(s): 2 | NUMA node0 CPU(s): 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38 | NUMA node1 CPU(s): 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39
[00:14:49] <bencc1> I'm getting "Requested memory nodes are not available - requested 1, available: 0"
[00:14:56] <bencc1> so probably not relevant to my hardware
[00:15:08] <programmerq> it may be that your one numa core is id 0
[00:15:14] <programmerq> mine are 0 and 1
[00:15:30] <programmerq> but you can likely leave it out altogether in your docker command
[00:16:31] <programmerq> in fact, doing the cpuset may be less useful on a system with one socket. There's also docker run --cpus and you can assign a fractional cpu amount and not worry about which core runs it.
[00:16:40] <programmerq> depending on your workload, that may or may not matter.
[00:16:49] <bencc1> I'll try. thanks

[03:33:15] <metrix> I have a set of files that I would like to share amongst many different images...Â  examples would be nginx, Java and Ruby.Â  Is there a way to add a prepackaged layer on top of these images?
[03:34:23] <dob1> I don't unstand, docker images list my_test_image   latest        9f513e5b53b2   8 seconds ago   1.06GB , my docker-compose is https://termbin.com/zsx4   but it doesn't start "Service my_test_image has neither an image nor a build context specified. At least one must be provided."
[03:34:48] <dob1> I miss something for sure
[03:34:52] <dob1> but I don't get what
[03:37:03] <dob1> got it, nevermind
[03:37:36] <rawtaz> metrix: not sure what you mean by that. if you want to share those files, just bind mount them into the containers or use a volume?

[03:41:15] <metrix> I have an SSL certificate that I need to use in Ruby, nginx and Java.Â  I thought it would make more sense to have an image layer that I could share and update between all images. something like `include metrix_crt` It doesn't seem like it would make sense to add a volume just for my single small file

[03:45:03] <metrix> rawtaz - I get that. It's more an intermediate certificate behind my firewall, not for outbound traffic.
[03:45:20] <rawtaz> ok
[03:46:53] <metrix> rawtaz: I appreciate your help.Â  I'll look into injecting it.

[07:35:52] <trafficjam> how do i stop a specific container using docker-compose?
[07:36:05] <trafficjam> i've tried `docker-compose stop <container_name>` but it doesn't work
[07:39:24] <rawtaz> well
[07:39:29] <rawtaz> did you consider looking at what it tells you?
[07:49:37] <trafficjam> get back to elixir rawtaz!
[07:51:52] <rawtaz> lol
[07:52:02] <rawtaz> im sorry but if you ask a question the stupid way, you get stupid answers ;)
[07:52:29] <rawtaz> you should know that the first thing to do when having a problem is to *establish the exact symptoms*, and then when asking about it *obviously explain the exact symptoms*
[07:52:35] <rawtaz> otherwise, what's the point?
[07:53:40] <rawtaz> love you too. hope you get a good 2022! :3
[07:54:47] <rawtaz> to answer, docker-compose stop, which you already tried, should indeed be able to stop a specific service that you give as the argument
[07:54:57] <rawtaz> but note that it's a service name you should give there, not a container name
[07:57:12] <trafficjam> lol all good man, sorted it out
[07:57:36] <trafficjam> and likewise with having a good 2022
[07:58:18] <rawtaz> what was the fix? :)
[07:58:41] <rawtaz> im not sure i like 2022 as much as 2021 in terms of typing it out.. will have to get used to it :<
[08:00:56] <trafficjam> problem was i was using docker container names instead of docker-compose 3 services names, like you said
[08:01:20] <trafficjam> just practice spamming your '2' key and you'll get used to it in no time
[08:01:21] <rawtaz> ah good :)
[08:01:27] <rawtaz> hehe yeah
[08:01:32] <rawtaz> time flies :o
[08:01:40] <rawtaz> once i got used to it it's time to learn 3
[08:01:56] <trafficjam> let's not get ahead of ourselves
[08:02:09] <trafficjam> what are your tech/business goals for this year by the way?
[08:02:30] <rawtaz> uuhhh thats a seriously good question
[08:02:44] <rawtaz> i would LIKE to get fricken started with an application i have an idea for
[08:03:29] <rawtaz> other than that, perhaps improve some infrastructure at customers, like refreshing some of the stuff in it, add and replace with new software and solutions
[08:03:38] <rawtaz> do more programming.
[08:03:41] <rawtaz> you?
[08:04:50] <trafficjam> oh nice, what are is the application in?
[08:05:01] <rawtaz> you mean area?
[08:05:02] <trafficjam> more programming is always good, any particular languages or platforms you want to learn?
[08:05:10] <trafficjam> *area yeah
[08:05:24] <rawtaz> hm like for consumers to save money, thats the key thing
[08:05:43] <trafficjam> groupon v2?
[08:05:43] <rawtaz> well i need to get started with elixir again, i only dabbled with it and need to learn it once and for all
[08:05:49] <rawtaz> and if i can, svelte too
[08:06:48] <rawtaz> hehe yeah groupon is on a similar topic indeed :)
[08:07:10] <trafficjam> svelte does look interesting, only thing keeping me away from it is the comparatively huge size of the react ecosystem, thing i'll wait until then
[08:07:33] <trafficjam> oh nice, probably time for a new spin on that idea
[08:07:34] <rawtaz> yeah its far from as established and ecosystemized as some others.. thats for sure
[08:07:41] <rawtaz> yeah
[08:08:06] <rawtaz> the "problem" is that i always have otehr things to attent heh
[08:08:09] <rawtaz> so i never get to it
[08:08:30] <rawtaz> but meh, there are no excuses :) its just bad dicipline
[08:08:38] <rawtaz> so what are you going to do with this year?
[08:09:21] <trafficjam> yeah you got to commit to it 100%, otherwise there's a much higher chance you'll fail
[08:09:42] <rawtaz> yeah
[08:10:02] <trafficjam> won't go into it too much but i want to launch a platform i'm been building on elixir and next
[08:10:15] <rawtaz> ooh cool!
[08:10:23] <rawtaz> you dont have to divulge the fishy details, thats fine
[08:10:33] <rawtaz> how long have you been working on it?

[08:11:19] <rawtaz> pets ftw
[08:12:07] <rawtaz> are you plannning on releasing it yourself, or is it something where you need to go with investors?
[08:13:36] <trafficjam> for way too long honestly. It's kind of been this idea i couldn't get out of my head, but it's form remained somewhat nebulous (and still is to some degree), i just want to launch it and see if people find it useful, and we'll go from there. If not, I gotta come up with some other project ideas lol
[08:14:00] <rawtaz> nice
[08:14:07] <rawtaz> but do you have a regular job primarily?
[08:14:08] <trafficjam> yeah i'll release it myself, prefer to stay away from investors unless absolutely necessary
[08:14:12] <rawtaz> this is a side project i take it?
[08:14:16] <rawtaz> yeah good
[08:14:17] <trafficjam> correct
[08:14:31] <rawtaz> elixir and phoenix for a rest api? or graphql?
[08:14:38] <trafficjam> absinthe for the api
[08:14:40] <rawtaz> ah
[08:15:05] <rawtaz> sweet. i wish you the best of luck with that :)
[08:15:46] <trafficjam> thought about using liveview for a while, but i think i'll keep LV for niche saas type projects, and anything aimed for a large audience i'll do graphql + next
[08:15:53] <trafficjam> cheers mate, we'll see how it goes

[08:17:02] <devslash> i am with a 2nd player which is a media player
[08:17:13] <trafficjam> what's the advantage of wireguard vs openvpn for this sort of thing?
[08:17:18] <devslash> i am with a 2nd container which is a media player
[08:17:26] <rawtaz> wireguard is so much simpler, and more lightweight
[08:17:45] <devslash> i am having an issue connecting to a container which is a media player

[14:14:36] <dob1> I don't understand why it is advised to run docker containers with a non-root user but a lot of official images use root
[14:15:28] <dob1> it is because they are intended to use them as a base image?   but for example the redis one run as root
[14:16:21] <ikke> because in the default setup, root in the container is root on the host
