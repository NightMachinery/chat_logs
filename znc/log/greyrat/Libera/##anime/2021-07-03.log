[00:16:48] <shinythings> I need more length before that happens
[00:17:00] <shinythings> maybe 10 cm
[00:17:09] <Bco1981> guess it's mostly a anime girl problem
[00:18:26] <shinythings> I don't think so

[06:13:59] <TsundereNoises> is it a lot of work doing it manually?

[06:59:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That wasn't going to happen. For two reasons, the first being that has nothing to do with its methods of action. The second is that do you think the lobbying-happy ISPs would let something good happen?
[07:00:07] <TsundereNoises> why improve anything when you can just strengthen your monopoly instead?

[09:27:07] <TsundereNoises> I was gonna ask him if he reads any interesting books
[09:28:10] <TsundereNoises> oh, amigojapan, do you think of 予知 as generally being like psychic precognition, or just like a prediction?
[09:29:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Does Japanese distinguish between the two?
[09:30:58] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: hmmm
[09:31:00] <TsundereNoises> I mean I feel like those are fundamentally different concepts not just at a language level
[09:31:05] <TsundereNoises> even if the word might be used as both sometimes
[09:31:25] <TsundereNoises> a lot of times a word has one sense that seems more common to people even if you can technically use it multiple ways
[09:31:33] <TsundereNoises> lots of english is that way
[09:31:49] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: isn't apredoction 予言?
[09:31:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some languages distinguish between levels of certainty and information reliability. Many don't. There is no grammatical nuance in English between a rumor and a fact.

[09:51:07] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, don't worry I'm out of questions
[09:51:38] <amigojapan> I prefer naausica to laputa

[09:53:19] <TsundereNoises> I also like naausica better
[09:53:47] <TsundereNoises> the best part of laputa is really that town at the beginning
[09:54:07] <TsundereNoises> for some reason the look of that whole sequence really appeals to me
[09:54:25] <MootPoot> for 600 I could get 3*8TB hard drives
[09:54:30] <TsundereNoises> the look of the town, I think I read it was inspired by a welch mining town

[09:57:17] <Urchin[emacs]> Nausicaä is pretty good, however, the best part is really the first 10 minutes or so, as it's rare for someone to show the process of how science works, much less for ecology
[09:57:47] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: I liked The Wind Rises as well

[10:59:07] <DunceCotus> hence the auto-correct typos

[10:59:30] <TsundereNoises> and it gives the origin
[10:59:34] <TsundereNoises> correctly
[10:59:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well I guess
[10:59:51] <TsundereNoises> having fewer words but worse definitions isn't a good argument for Webster's
[10:59:57] <DunceCotus> but I meant a computer computer
[11:00:41] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: a phone is just as much a computer as any other computer
[11:01:06] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises that'd be quite a marketing strategy: "Fewer words, worse definitions. Take the Miriam-Webster experience."
[11:01:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my phone has now power than many super computers of the past
[11:01:34] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: it would make them stand out anyway
[11:01:55] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: wouldn't you agree that the point of a dictionary is to help people understand what words mean in the language the dictionary is for?
[11:02:17] <amigojapan> I disagree TsundereNoises 
[11:02:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that's why some people think aliens provided us with semiconductor technology
[11:02:37] <DunceCotus> or we reverse engineered it from crashed alien craft
[11:02:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so if you were learning english and your 1st language was Swedish, you didn't know any Japanese, and someone in ENGLISH said "I was watching hentai last night" and you looked it up in the dictionary, would you want it to not explain that?
[11:02:53] <DunceCotus> cause just about everywhere else humans are practically still in the stone age
[11:03:08] <TsundereNoises> or say "I was watching weird last night"
[11:03:10] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: everyone has a definition for a word in their minds. So every one has a mini dictionary already
[11:03:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan there was even a Star Trek episode about this
[11:03:51] <DunceCotus> a "time ship" crashes on Earth in the late 60s
[11:04:07] <DunceCotus> and a corporation reverse engineers it to start the computer revolution
[11:04:08] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes but as we've established, my mini dictionary for japanese is orders of magnitude worse than tomakos, and yours of english is not as good as mine and this is normal for everyone
[11:04:20] <TsundereNoises> a dictionary is helpful to help people understand what others mean
[11:04:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the one about the aliens that speak by metaphor?

[11:05:20] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: yeah but I don't agree that dictionaries have the last word
[11:05:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: neither do I, I've ranted about people treating dictionaries too authoritatively like every other week
[11:05:52] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: sounds like something about burying people

[11:10:18] <ButterNoodle> has to be good for you right 
[11:10:19] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I think it's at least plausible, but I haven't looked into it
[11:10:29] <amigojapan> Ok
[11:10:40] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: on the other hand, I'm 100% sure people will overstate whatever benefit there may or may not be for marketting
[11:10:47] <TsundereNoises> because everyone loves to oversell health food
[11:11:18] <TsundereNoises> yeah the whole antioxidant thing gets so dumb, thanks Linus Pauling
[11:11:42] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises . We are more fans of black tea. But we drink green tea to prevent cancer
[11:11:58] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean I can say 2 things for sure
[11:12:08] <amigojapan> What
[11:12:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: you can get cancer even if you drink a lot of green tea, and you might never get cancer even if you never drink it
[11:12:27] <amigojapan> Right
[11:12:58] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you may never get cancer even if you are a heavy smoker too
[11:13:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: cancer basically works like rolling a bunch of dice over and over, and when enough of them come up 1s at once, you get cancer
[11:13:28] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: smoking is weighted dice
[11:13:30] <TsundereNoises> you can make more rolls or fewer, you can tweak the odds, but fundamentally it's still a crapshoot
[11:13:44] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but they are dice that you can change the bias
[11:13:56] <amigojapan> Right
[11:14:04] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[11:14:33] <TsundereNoises> if I were designing it as a game, it'd be like roll again every time you smoke a single cigarette, roll every time you get on an airplane

[11:57:10] <Cryowolf> they could finish in less than 30-60 minutes but would sell for a ton
[11:57:17] <Cryowolf> even more than that amigojapan, one sold for like 50,000
[11:57:21] <Cryowolf> dollars

[12:13:35] <ButterNoodle> yes
[12:13:38] <ButterNoodle> we can all agree

[12:14:27] <amigojapan> JesseDesu2: it has tones of legitimate uses tho

[12:14:47] <DunceCotus> sure its useful

[12:26:00] <prpldmn> oh wait, im doing a course on python. forgot about that hehe
[12:27:45] <amigojapan> prpldmn: if you already know C python should be a piece of cake
[12:28:36] <prpldmn> i really wanna get into embedded systems
[12:28:59] <amigojapan> prpldmn: for that C is the way to go
[12:29:26] <amigojapan> And assembler
[12:31:36] <amigojapan> prpldmn: but python is a better language to learn as first language
[12:36:09] <prpldmn> ill try doing some stuff with arduino
[12:37:16] <prpldmn> when i get my hands on a board (＞﹏＜)	
[12:42:46] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: lots of embedded systems these days can run python reasonably well
[12:43:05] <KatrinValerie> obviously, if you have like realtime applications you'll want to drop to C + ASM
[12:43:16] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[12:43:59] <prpldmn> KatrinValerie: i've seen some stuff for arduino and python, but i want full control
[12:44:22] <prpldmn> that type of low level is what im most interested in
[12:44:26] <prpldmn> nya
[12:44:55] <KatrinValerie> python can also be used as glue code
[12:45:20] <KatrinValerie> So you can combine python with C and ASM stuff
[12:45:50] <KatrinValerie> There are lots of libs for python that run their stuff outside of the python interpreter
[12:46:01] <prpldmn> ( : ౦ ‸ ౦ : )	
[12:46:05] <KatrinValerie> numpy
[12:46:21] <KatrinValerie> and then there's bindings for cluster stuff 
[12:46:32] <KatrinValerie> A bunch of different APIs are supported for distributed computing
[12:46:58] <KatrinValerie> And then python is just used to distribute the workload across stuff, while the heavy lifting is done by native applications
[12:47:39] <KatrinValerie> This is why you can write high performance applications with python

[14:03:24] <Sadale> But why not I guess :P
[14:03:35] <amigojapan> Sadale: maybe if the users had a special RPI Woking as a router with open ports?

[14:03:53] <Sadale> yeah that'd work
[14:04:10] <Sadale> I suspect that such a software already exist tho
[14:04:41] <amigojapan> Sadale: since the infrastructure wold be much cheaper we could easily undercut other VPN networks
[14:05:34] <Sadale> not really. You really have to let the user control who exactly are allowed to use your network. Otherwise those criminals could use your network to do evil shit
[14:05:54] <Sadale> and that could get you into legal trouble depending on which country you're in, even if you aren't the one doing the crime.

[14:13:11] <Sadale> amigojapan, depends on the VPN provider. I believe that some don't give a shit tho :P
[14:13:22] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:13:22] <KatrinValerie> Japan sounds a tad bit reactionary in it's politics
[14:13:42] <Sadale> amigojapan, And piracy isn't a big deal in most of the places. But if it's a crime, the VPN provider would probably ban the user.
[14:14:05] <amigojapan> I see Sadale 
[14:14:22] <amigojapan> Sadale: we could do that
[14:14:27] <amigojapan> Ban the user
[14:15:33] <Sadale> Some people hosting tor exit node is running into legal trouble because they're being used for illegal stuffs. That's what get me so worried about how this inter-VPN system would be used.
[14:15:58] <mexen> amigojapan: 30GB?
[14:16:00] <amigojapan> I see Sadale 
[14:16:20] <mexen> Wow but what if you are downloading games you have bought lol
[14:16:27] <amigojapan> mexen: yes 30gb  upload per month
[14:16:40] <amigojapan> mexen: upload
[14:16:48] <mexen> oooh
[14:17:00] <mexen> OK yeah that makes sense phew
[14:17:05] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:17:10] <Sadale> amigojapan, why'd they call you tho? That's stupid
[14:17:20] <Sadale> amigojapan, And is there any punishment after they call you?
[14:17:35] <amigojapan> Sadale: they call you before they calk the police
[14:17:44] <Sadale> amigojapan, huh? Uploading stuffs isn't illegal.
[14:17:58] <Sadale> Just because you're uploading stuffs doesn't mean that you're uploading anything illegal
[14:18:20] <amigojapan> Sadale: it is if it is piracy. And that is how they monitor it
[14:19:45] <amigojapan> Sadale: but you need to give a reason
[14:20:38] <amigojapan> Sadale: when they called me, I said "I think I have been hacked" and I never downloaded Torrents again
[14:20:53] <Sadale> amigojapan, I see.
[14:21:21] <Sadale> amigojapan, meh. So if you're torrently the trick is not to go over 30GB upload and you're good xD
[14:21:48] <amigojapan> Sadale: or have a good excuse to have large upload
[14:22:07] <Sadale> true

[14:34:14] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[14:34:15] <MootPoot> either they really cheaped out on the gloss layer
[14:34:21] <MootPoot> or something is wrong
[14:34:45] <MootPoot> I've used the shit out of all of my phones, like 4-5 hours a day for years on end and that's never happened
[14:35:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there is a puddle of alcohol over the swipe keyboard when I clean it
[14:35:28] <MootPoot> that shouldnt really do anything tbh
[14:36:05] <MootPoot> I have seen that happen, but only on super budget phones
[14:36:08] <MootPoot> actually
[14:36:24] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[14:36:27] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  it might be possible that they actually used a plastic screen but then put that gloss on top to make it appear like glass
[14:37:19] <amigojapan> amigojapan: maybe MootPoot 
[14:39:07] <MootPoot> I used to see that happen to early touchscreens
[14:39:10] <MootPoot> even capcitative ones
[14:40:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: this does feel like glass tho
[14:40:44] <MootPoot> the top layer feels like glass
[14:40:51] <MootPoot> but the bottom is actually plastic
[14:40:57] <amigojapan> I see
[14:41:05] <MootPoot> its some sort of hard expxy with plastic
[14:41:36] <MootPoot> if you have seen old smartphones like used galaxy s2/s3s and iphones you will notice the same thing around heavy use areas like the hardware back button
[14:42:12] <amigojapan> I see

[14:42:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: tomako's new iPhone has a non phisical button that feels physical
[14:43:52] <MootPoot> thats the vibration motor under it
[14:45:08] <amigojapan> I see
[14:46:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you even need to have a certain amount of pressure on it before it "clicks". It's very believable
[14:47:08] <MootPoot> as I understand it, its actually the fingerprint sensor
[14:47:15] <MootPoot> when it gets a detection that you pressed it
[14:47:19] <MootPoot> then the motor goes off

[14:59:27] <MootPoot> no idea
[14:59:40] <KatrinValerie> If you didn't get your full vaccination yet and the delta variant is around, I wouldn't go.
[14:59:49] <KatrinValerie> But I am also at high risk for a severe case
[14:59:58] <darkwitch> get your emotional vaccine shot
[15:00:10] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: it appeared here, and authorities are just losing it
[15:01:22] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: it already is in Germany as well, I am expecting a sharp rise in cases towards fall
[15:01:29] <KatrinValerie> when summer vacations end
[15:01:47] <KatrinValerie> and the kids will spread it through school again, because they still have no concept on infection prevention that actually works
[15:03:32] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: i had it with this covid and its government-imposed lockdowns
[15:03:38] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: worst part of it is just lockdowns
[15:03:43] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: and isolation
[15:03:56] <KatrinValerie> It is not the worst part hassoon 
[15:04:10] <KatrinValerie> Without the lockdowns the situation in the hospitals would have been worse
[15:04:17] <KatrinValerie> You saw what happened in italy
[15:04:44] <KatrinValerie> I even lost a friend to this pandemic, please do not underestimate the situation
[15:05:17] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: if it weren't for our modern medicine, this could be as horrible as the black death
[15:05:55] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: the idiot causing the appearance of the virus from the beginning is the one to blame
[15:07:05] <KatrinValerie> blaming this on someone is pretty pointless
[15:07:20] <KatrinValerie> we knew of the potential of this kind of virus causing a pandemic for years
[15:07:25] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: meh this did not appear out of nowhere, something/someone is there did this to us
[15:07:42] <hassoon> and.. sorry for your friend

[15:08:01] <KatrinValerie> It is harmful and can incite violence against minorities in real life

[15:13:00] <Sumida> confidence is a good thing
[15:13:20] <Sumida> still no guarantee for success
[15:13:32] <amigojapan> Right
[15:17:08] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: can you cite a source on that claim? I am honestly interested if new evidence turned up.
[15:18:11] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: meh watched many documentary shows explaining that, will look uo some for you when i have the chance
[15:18:25] <amigojapan> Sumida: anyway fault finding won't save lives that are already gone. I don't like playing the blame game
[15:19:06] <Sumida> amigojapan: sure, why are you telling me this?

[15:20:41] <amigojapan> 7:39 PM <hassoon> KatrinValerie: meh whoever hates/harms asians is an idiot  7:39 PM <Sumida> they helped spread the virus hassoon
[15:20:56] <Sumida> amigojapan: I was talking about the 5G antennas!
[15:21:10] <amigojapan> Ah ok Sumida 
[15:21:31] <Sumida> some people thought they were created to make people sick
[15:21:42] <Sumida> so they started attacking them
[15:21:54] <Cryowolf> people are dumb
[15:21:55] <amigojapan> Yeah
[15:22:53] <Sumida> so I thought, if hassoon believes one such theory (someone created it), maybe he believes all of them
[15:22:56] <hassoon> amigojapan: what time is it there
[15:23:00] <amigojapan> Sumida: I have other reasons to hate 5g, but it is not the safety of it
[15:23:17] <amigojapan> hassoon: 19:53
[15:23:27] <MootPoot> why do you hate 5g amigo
[15:23:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cause in Japan they are soon retiring 3g
[15:24:02] <hassoon> amigojapan: how can i immigrate to japan
[15:24:03] <MootPoot> and?

[15:24:48] <amigojapan> hassoon: do you have a bachelor's degree?
[15:25:43] <MootPoot> does it count if I have 2 bachelors degrees amigo
[15:25:58] <amigojapan> hassoon: you need one for software development in Japan for the work visa
[15:26:06] <Sumida> you can not immigrate to japan right now, even if you are the best software developer on the planet
[15:26:17] <hassoon> amigojapan: ya i do
[15:26:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it is the same. As long as you have one
[15:26:36] <Sumida> not even as a tourist
[15:26:36] <MootPoot> also if you want to immigrate and nationalize you need to give up your home countires citizenship
[15:26:56] <amigojapan> hassoon: then you can apply for a work visa when the airports open again
[15:27:01] <hassoon> amigojapan: do you know of some trusted websites where i can apply for jobs in japan ?
[15:27:25] <amigojapan> hassoon: you also need a company to get you a job and sponsor you
[15:28:00] <amigojapan> hassoon: I will link you
[15:28:17] <MootPoot> honestly for the most part your best chance is to get into a company that sends you to japan

[18:53:08] <Sadale> I'd say it's certainly something that wouldn't be appropriate if the US acted alone.
[18:53:23] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, aw
[18:53:27] <dfch> amigojapan, Sadale, it's absolute nonsense. You can't send ICBM to the moon. ICBMs can (with modification) be used to deliver manned space capsules to low Earth orbit, but reaching the moon requires multiple orders of magnitude more power.
[18:53:30] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, what happened to her mom tho?
[18:53:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: dead
[18:53:50] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, ouch
[18:53:56] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I'm sorry to hear about that
[18:54:01] <amigojapan> Sadale: it's not the first time someone suggests something like that. Also with the oil spill in the gold of Mexico they wanted to launch a nuke to stop the leak
[18:54:08] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, So basically, someone's dead, and now the blame game started.

[19:36:12] <mixfix41> i just need people who volunteer to give me money
[19:36:31] <mixfix41> then i can say they are a burden to society and keep it that way
[19:36:51] <Sadale> If I were a son of a billionaire tho I wouldn't have to work as long as I live frugally

[19:50:39] <HubertFarnsworth> What's special about titanium computer case?
[19:50:51] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, no idea. You have to ask dfch for that. xD
[19:51:42] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, and it was years ago.
[19:52:22] <HubertFarnsworth> Oh. I heard graphic card prices are dropping. Is it true?
[19:52:35] <Sadale> no idea
[19:52:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Since China banned crypto mining
[19:52:55] <Sadale> I wouldn't be surprised tho, with all those bad news in crypto coin floating around
[19:53:03] <mixfix41> which card do you have in mind
[19:53:20] <mixfix41> apex requires not too strong of one (within my buying guidelines) prices are stiff but i cant say they reverse
[19:53:33] <Sadale> I should totally prepare the tech stack required for creating a new coin. Then when the next crypto hype starts, I'd release my coin to the market for $$$
[19:53:43] <mixfix41> if they go down id say people just are interest or high end production is abundent
[19:53:58] <HubertFarnsworth> I always buy couple of gen behind the latest gen ones.
[19:54:41] <mixfix41> i read about buying nvidia 4-6 hundo series and i agree this guideline still stands strong
[19:54:49] <Sadale> I've got the almost best iGPU in the world. It's AMD 2400G. :3
[19:54:59] <HubertFarnsworth> Woah
[19:55:04] <HubertFarnsworth> Wow Sadale 
[19:55:39] <Sadale> It's a CPU having one of the best iGPU, and it's quite affordable. However the performance is only comparable with GT 1030.
[19:55:42] <mixfix41> mess up thing about a gpu product is the components seem like could be attachable or like a mini board pc rather then one piece
[19:55:56] <Sadale> Not exceptionally powerful. Not too bad either.
[19:56:35] <Sadale> mixfix41, heat disappation tho
[19:56:52] <Sadale> GPU heats up like crazy.
[19:57:49] <HubertFarnsworth> GT 1030? Wtf Sadale?
[19:58:00] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, is that good or bad?
[19:58:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Isn't that bad?
[19:58:34] <HubertFarnsworth> Gt1030 is old right?
[19:58:43] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, yep. I mean what you'd expect for iGPU?
[19:59:05] <HubertFarnsworth> Ohh
[19:59:07] <Sadale> And actually it's not that bad at all. I could play games smoothly in lower settings.
[19:59:23] <Sadale> And I didn't want a dedicated GPU.
[19:59:47] <HubertFarnsworth> If you get a dedicated GPU, it will be pretty good.
[19:59:55] <Sadale> I'm limited by the height of my computer case and its power supply. It isn't compatible with dedicated GPU. There isn't enough space, plus the power supply is too weak.
[20:00:38] <HubertFarnsworth> Power supply and cabin are nothing. You can replace them in jiffy.
[20:01:02] <Sadale> My current desktop computer case is actually kind of like laptop. I put the case onto a table that I could move around any time. And the monitor is attached right above the case with a hinge :D
[20:01:10] <Sadale> I jokingly call it superlaptop.
[20:01:30] <Sadale> It's a custom computer case made with acrylic and 3D printer parts.

[20:19:18] <mixfix41> otherwise all that quality is bloat
[20:19:25] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: what is that brass/gold colour thing?
[20:19:34] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, RAM
[20:19:57] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, The "heatsink" that comes with the RAM. But as RAM aren't generating much heat, it's mostly just for decoration.
[20:20:36] <HubertFarnsworth> Woah, I didn't know that. I am way too behind Sadale 
[20:21:18] <HubertFarnsworth> The circular thing above the ram, is that processor fan Sadale?
[20:21:25] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, yep.
[20:21:42] <HubertFarnsworth> It looks quite big
[20:21:46] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, BTW, the orange square box on the right of the table is a finger-safe anti-mini-cockroach box. Basically you put the bait inside the box, close it and your finger wouldn't be able to touch the toxic bait, and the box would still allow mini-cockroach to either and take the bait. The one on my table doesn't have bait inside tho. :P
[20:21:50] <HubertFarnsworth> Or is that how it is?
[20:21:59] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, oh. It's the computer case being small. Not the fan being big.
[20:22:30] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, My screen is 15" diagonal, and it's about the same size as the computer case.
[20:22:49] <HubertFarnsworth> You got those pests huh?
[20:23:03] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, yep. It's a new thing to me. :'(
[20:23:11] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, the bait is only semi-effective.
[20:23:58] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: usually the problem in these cases is building's drainage.

[20:24:51] <MootPoot> Sadale:  but afaik thats the needle not the vaccine
[20:25:08] <Sadale> Not really. For flu vaccine it didn't hurt to me.

[20:25:32] <MootPoot> weird thing is that there is no swelling or anything
[20:25:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, it's yokai. It's a yokai of arm ache.
[20:26:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Pain at the injection site is probably more a function of needle size, tenseness and the user's skill than actually related to the vaccine itself.
