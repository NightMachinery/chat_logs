[02:16:11] <qrpnxz> the masked hero video did have bit too much noise tho, and not made so clear how static woman won, but i like shoe tool, and fight to repair because that one is kind of epic
[02:17:36] <qrpnxz> i think it would be cool if rossman worked with the fsf on a video specifically for the general public rather than his channel. Either on right to repair or free software or both. Made to share.
[02:18:10] <qrpnxz> oh another format that is good for sharing is ted talk style, which stallman did do one
[02:18:28] <leah> he seems to have a less defined stance on software

[02:26:16] <ggoes> the rms talk is on fsf.org in a few places

[02:28:46] <leah> it's actually more in our favour now because: 20 years ago, proprietary software vendors were more benevolent and not as outright evil

[02:52:28] <isf> that is completly inmoral becouse, at a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution because that would grant it legitimacy. Nonfree software is a problem; to present it as a solution denies the existence of the problem.

But when they discover that they can't use silly stuff like Zoom or in China's case wemeet and wechat, they wonder "Why can't a good operating system do basic things???", and develop a
[04:50:49] <CoWaxDanguin> rejection of free software altogether, there are quite a few cases around me.  I'm not sure what kind of "Gentle introduction" we should do, maybe switch them to free software on their nonfree OS before switching them to *Linux/BSD/etc, but that still doesn't solve the issues of compatibility around them.  Currently our main goal might as well be better if targeted at governments (IMPORTANT! Look at
[04:50:51] <CoWaxDanguin> Australia and China!), organizations and coorporations, and to get people the idea of ... our ideas, then when enough people are convinced for some time, campaign to use the free ones right away 
[04:50:52] <madage> the system has seduced them and first they need to be unseduced, discontent
[04:51:23] <CoWaxDanguin> I mean it's not that good of a method/transition when we're looking at it with our moral views, but anyhow pragmatics are quite important to get to the general public

[04:57:27] <madage> qrpnxz: when I said that many will keep thinking as gratis, I meant in the sense of "even after having being told the freedom meaning"
[04:57:27] *** Joins: juno__ (~junebug@2600:1700:3db0:2540:84f7:9c76:4e7d:2835)
[04:57:37] <madage> it's a kind of "malice" if you will
[04:58:15] <madage> or conditioned thinking, they are so into a pattern or world view that the main point will keep being the gratis part
[04:58:32] <madage> if it's both freedom and gratis
[04:58:38] <qrpnxz> yeah, i've seen video of stallman explaining how open sources misses the point, explaining how "intellectual property" is propaganda, and then they get to QA, and they just parrot those terms again like because it's totally conditioned
[04:59:51] <qrpnxz> and people roll their eyes, but stallman is right to be annoyed, because often the term begs the question
[05:00:36] <qrpnxz> it's like asking "did you know you're a murderer?" and you don't even agree you are a murder, so the question is just invalid
[05:01:11] <madage> for me it took sometime into our communities to start losing parts of that condition, for quite sometime I remeber being a little "skeptic" and thinking there was some gotcha somewhere, some evil behind the scenes, that I was just being sold and played and that the freedoms wouldn't be possible otherwise
[05:01:25] <madage> kept searching for malice, for the trick
[05:02:29] <qrpnxz> yeah, freeware is spooky, but free software can be trusted.
[05:03:46] <madage> and the hard thing is, I only got to overcome it once I started actualy looking at source code, learning compiling, making my changes, then I could really undestand and believe
[05:04:32] <madage> so I think there is some education that is needed or at least some experience in other fields
[05:05:10] <qrpnxz> that's why i like the shoetool video, it makes the freedom we are talking about more relatable i think
[05:05:57] <madage> if you "just use" software and mainly special purpose networked GUI software, you cannot get a picture of software being anything besides a "product"
[05:07:50] <madage> yeap, but I agree with what leah said, there is something off putting with those videos, I don't know how to make better ones though

[08:13:29] <DiffieHellman> Well, that's not possible even with cash.
[08:13:48] <isf> you can make trades too
[08:13:52] <isf> and that is economy
[08:15:17] <isf> if you trade goods with other with anonimity you can do it with cash if you for example say to other to pay it for you
[08:15:39] <isf> becouse remmeber, cash dont have a hash, or something to mark you as crypto have to recognice the trade
[08:15:47] <DiffieHellman> But, the person who you trade with can remember who you are, or features like your height.
[08:16:14] <isf> with cash all trades are without recognice (if you dont accept voluntarily say who you are)
[08:16:23] <isf> not always DiffieHellman
[08:16:40] <isf> becouse, if is true they have eyes for see who you look
[08:16:41] <DiffieHellman> Most people carry tracking devices around, so the transaction is indeed recorder.
[08:16:47] <DiffieHellman> *recorded
[08:16:57] <isf> you dont need buy things of others youself
[08:17:10] <isf> the most normaly in economy is buy things of others who you dont know
[08:17:20] <isf> and that only can happen with cash 
[08:17:46] <isf> but, in terms of computing you always can recognice something from others becouse, internet works for connect people
[08:17:56] <isf> so, for do that you need recognice
[08:17:58] <isf> who are who
[08:18:21] <isf> so, in terms of computing you can make your computing more private, etc but anonymous that is something incompatible from my point of view
[08:21:06] <CoWaxDanguin> isf: Monero is anonymous
[08:21:19] <isf> xD
[08:21:27] <isf> if you believe it, i dont go to stop you
[08:21:49] <isf> i can recognice you intelectual freedom to be wrong, and i believe it to for be wrong to from your point of view
[08:22:00] <isf> and i dont go to stop your project of life
[08:22:04] <isf> :D
[08:22:22] <qrpnxz> DiffieHellman, "It's hard to punch a number in and press send?" no, mostly my complain is confirmation times or having one coin and having to spend another coin, in which case you have to wait even longer and pay up significant exchange fees. Ofc, every coin is different though. If i have dash and have to spend dash, now that's a very smooth experience.
[08:23:13] <DiffieHellman> qrpnxz: That's mostly limited to bitcoin I believe. Monero tends to have really cheap exchange fees.
[08:23:37] <qrpnxz> that makes no sense to say since it takes two to exchange
[08:24:13] <qrpnxz> anyway, i much much rather GNU taler start being usable
[08:26:54] <Atr[m]> The fight for freedom is preciously fragile and must be protected to be preserved. To make sacrifices to it, be it as a clause or temporary measure, is to betray its fundamental reason to exist and lead to the extinction of liberty.

[08:38:07] <qrpnxz> do you think it's not a policy issue because it is

[08:41:05] <isf> and promote it
[08:41:12] <isf> in the practice
[08:41:22] <qrpnxz> that makes no sense but ok
[08:41:33] <isf> becouse you dont need create a new distro, for be the owner of your computing
[08:41:59] <isf> becouse when you receive a copy of free software, you are the owner of that copy (no the author if you dont write it))
[08:42:14] <isf> and that, only you can get with free distros
[08:42:39] <isf> but all free distros, are manteined for groups of individuals, no for colectives

[14:57:09] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec2: My reccomendation is to grab the GNU Linux-libre sources, compile it with the default config, and see if it boots. If it boots, you can go through numeros rounds of disabling uneeded drivers and enabling needed ones, then seeing if the new config boots. 
[14:57:56] <DiffieHellman> I ran into some weird libreboot issue where just the default Linux sources config (with the GNU Linux-libre patches applied) didn't actually boot.

[16:04:27] <stevessss> so.. 1/2 of open source software written by universities or as parts of the bsd project and such is licensed under "mit license"  or "bsd license" or some similar licenses... most of those allow redistribution under any terms you want provided you require attribution
[16:04:56] <stevessss> gpl v2, v3 has specific things you can require and as far as I know is not compatible with a bsd-style attribution clause, hwoever most gpl stuff is "v2 or later"   or "v3 or later"
[16:05:47] <stevessss> gplv3.1 being invented to duplicate gplv3 while allowing the requirement of a "bsd-style" attribution clause if its parrent project required it would fix this and allow mixing of gplv2 and bsd software provided it all got relicensed under gplv3.1 with an "attribution clause"
[16:07:07] <stevessss> as far as I know... nothing in open source philosphy is terribly against requiring "attribution clauses"   but if a license doesn't allow one to require that, then you cant relicense from bsd-style to that license
[16:11:36] <stevessss> this would eventually require GPLv4 be released v4(no attribution required) and v4.1(attribution can be required)... unless most people feel attribution is the right thing to do anyways
[16:12:16] *** Joins: herd (~herd@mta763.solicitae.com)
[16:12:54] <DiffieHellman> Um, there's no need to make GPLv3.1, as the GPLv3 allows you to add specific terms.
[16:14:05] <DiffieHellman> You can add terms that require attribution in some reasonable way, as long as it isn't too burdesome to do.
[16:14:26] <stevessss> so.. "please include a copy of this bsd attribution file"   is fine..
[16:14:39] <DiffieHellman> If you apply a term that is opposed to the license, or is too burdersome, then users can remove such term though.
[16:15:01] <CoWaxDanguin> DiffieHellman: There are some things that you cannot add as additional terms to the GPL, i.e. additional restrictions.  For example, if I patent my software and want to only grant free software developers patent license, the GPL does not allow doing so.
[16:15:05] <stevessss> and if the software from which it was derrived mandated it... then you have illegalware
[16:15:28] <DiffieHellman> An example of a term that is too burdesome is the advertising clause in the 4 clause BSD - as that made it impossible to adversite software that had more than a single developer.
[16:15:51] <DiffieHellman> CoWaxDanguin: Yes, as I mentioned, addittional restrictions can just be ignored.
[16:16:08] <CoWaxDanguin> DiffieHellman: Exactly, but in my example this additional restriction is useful
[16:16:24] <stevessss> yeah.. that might justify a v3.1 that would allow combination of software never to be advertised under any circumstances other than having a homepage
[16:16:27] <CoWaxDanguin> Also it's unclear what's an additional right and what's an additional restriction
[16:16:43] <DiffieHellman> Well not really, you don't stand a chance against a patent aggressors with thousands of patents with just one.
[16:17:22] <DiffieHellman> Patents are only useful for dealing with trools if you're IBM and have thousands of software patents.
[16:17:31] <CoWaxDanguin> DiffieHellman: lol that's reality, where copyright isn't even enforced properly and the gpl is treated as pd. So ditch all fs licenses?
[16:17:50] <stevessss> a 3.1+advertising could hav ea checklist of contributors who've agreed to wave that and be on a math to migrate to gplv3
[16:18:29] <DiffieHellman> stevessss: Disallowing advertising would go against the GPLv3's terms, so that is not allowed. You can require that advertising not use your programs name, or your name though.
[16:19:07] <stevessss> so.. bsd with advertising clause can never be re-licensed
[16:19:28] <stevessss> bsd with just "no warranty" and "as-is" statement is fine to relicensed gplv3
[16:19:43] <DiffieHellman> CoWaxDanguin: Nah, I'm just saying to focus on copyright and don't bother with patents - as the patent clause that the GPLv3 is the best that can be done about them.
[16:19:49] <stevessss> or "no-warranty"   "as-is"   "attribution required"
[16:20:52] <stevessss> https://templates.openoffice.org/en/bsd-license?msclkid=690e34ebaf5611ecb1c9eeb558d882a8
[16:20:57] <DiffieHellman> stevessss: Programs under the BSD 4 clause can be relicensed, the issue is that as soon as you combine more than two pieces of software under the BSD 4 clause, you can no longer advertise, as your ad would need to contain 30 odd clauses.
[16:21:34] <stevessss> "Neither the name of the nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission"  
[16:21:48] <stevessss> so.. including a clauses.txt file and linking to it in README.md is no big deal if it keeps growing
[16:21:52] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but that doesn't stop you from advertising, so that isn't a freedom restriction.
[16:22:23] <stevessss> so that specific bsd-template can be re-licensed gplv3 just fine
[16:22:54] <stevessss> with some extra allows terms like requiring an attribution file and not using the names of the attribution file in any promotion such as tv advertising
[16:23:03] <DiffieHellman> Actually, you can't "re-license" BSD 3 clause code unless you're the copyright author. You can combine it with GPLv3 code though.
[16:23:27] <DiffieHellman> Re-licensing would consist of changing the copyright in the file header, which isn't allowed.\
[16:24:12] <stevessss> bsd require you "include" their copyright header"  but it doesn't require that be the main license
[16:24:45] <DiffieHellman> It requires that such license applies to the code you copied, but modifications on that code can be under your license of choice.
[16:25:47] <stevessss> I guess put in gplv3 extra term that includes that notice and a link to an unmodified copy of the bsd-software imported
[16:25:54] <stevessss> then the project as a whole can be gplv3
[16:26:26] <DiffieHellman> Yes, you can require that you mention a sentence in the README.md, as it's just a sentence.
[16:27:30] <stevessss> what about other licenses such as apache and mit license?
[16:27:42] <stevessss> mit is the least restrictive as far as I know and the easiest to relicense
[16:27:55] <DiffieHellman> MIT had many license's, the FSF really calls it the expat license.
[16:28:52] <DiffieHellman> You cannot re-license expat unless you're the copyright holder, but you can choose whatever license you want for your own changes.
[16:29:16] <DiffieHellman> The Apache 2.0 is a pushover license as well, but it has a patent clause like the GPLv3 that deals with patents,.
[16:29:31] <stevessss> http://gnu.org/  can you open that site?
[16:29:51] <DiffieHellman> I would say to use https://gnu.org/ instead
[16:30:10] <stevessss> that doesn't open either.. 
[16:30:22] <DiffieHellman> Open in what context?

[16:31:44] <stevessss> so does 443
[16:32:17] <DiffieHellman> gnu.org seems down at the moment. I would say to wait until it comes back online.
[16:32:55] <stevessss> if this happens a few times this month or becomes prolonged I'd hapilly donate free hosting
[16:33:09] <DiffieHellman> Why do you use telnet anyway? I would reccommend netcat unless you're using specifically telnet (as the telnet client sends extra control characters).
[16:33:21] <stevessss> netcat is good too
[16:33:23] <CoWaxDanguin> DiffieHellman: I ger that point :)
[16:33:49] <DiffieHellman> I'm sure the FSF has a fine setup, but I guess some hardware is failing somewhere.
[16:33:51] <stevessss> I use telnet becasue I can talk to http servers and it used to be on every *nix box   whereas netcat was a fancy upgrade I'd have to install
[16:34:24] <DiffieHellman> Please don't use the "*nix" term, as that matches Linux, GNU/Linux, Unix, Minix etc, even though those are all very different things.

[16:38:48] <DiffieHellman> Yes, GNU readline was quite innovate at the time, so that's why they put it under GPL. 
[16:39:00] <DiffieHellman> LibreHacker: Yes, I kept wondering who you were even though I knew.
[16:40:31] <LibreHacker> DiffieHellman: Andrew

[16:43:12] <AwesomeAdam54321> When I was thinking of TOFU, I meant the way Gemini uses it
[16:43:29] <DiffieHellman> Gemini can easily be MiTM'd, yes.
[16:45:12] <AwesomeAdam54321> You would have to trust the first connection, but any MiTM attacks done after that would fail since the self-signed certificate from the site is different
[16:45:34] <AwesomeAdam54321> *different from the first time
[16:46:34] <AwesomeAdam54321> There's also a completely different approach with GNS from GNUnet
