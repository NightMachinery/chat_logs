[02:05:59] <El_Che> when you ask for a coke in a bar/bistro/whatever and they serve pepsi for whatever reason, they warn you about it :)
[02:07:28] <SmokeMachine> Hi you all! As there is method implemented by Raku to class and token, role and regex implemented by regex to grammar, how can I create a custom-method-ish keyword to be implemented by a custom language to my custom class-ish?
[02:09:40] <japhb> El_Che: I think that's because they have no idea how people will react to getting a different cola than they expect.  I'm used to both Coke and Pepsi from dealing with the restaurant soda wars, and Royal Crown even at this point, for restaurants that elected to stay the heck out of it, but even so I occasionally get served something really odd and go "WTH is this?" and it turns out to be some local soda 
[02:09:46] <japhb> brewery or something
[02:11:15] <japhb> SmokeMachine: There's a lot of "custom"s there.  Did you write an internal or external DSL?
[02:15:32] <SmokeMachine> japhb: I‚Äôve been planning on making this (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage) be defined by a string, n√© defined by code‚Ä¶
[02:29:51] <moon-child> japhb: presumably, rather than class A { method b { ... } }, custom-classish A { custom-methodish b { ... } }
[02:30:15] <moon-child> where the ... isn't a code block, but has its own grammar rules, as a regex

[02:57:39] <Voldenet> kind of similar thing: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Slang-Roman/blob/main/lib/Slang/Roman.rakumod

[14:18:02] <andinus> so i'm using  Net::SMTP and have "LEAVE $c.quit;" to close the connnection after the job is done
[14:20:24] <andinus> but when Net::SMTP is unable to connect it throws, i have a catch block to handle that, then "LEAVE $c.quit" still runs, but $c isn't defined so it throws another error
[14:20:56] <andinus> i could use "KEEP $c.quit" but then what if sending the mail itself fails, in that case it wouldn't run .quit
[14:21:29] <andinus> is there a way to say do, "my $c = NET::SMTP(..) && LEAVE $c.quit"
[14:21:44] <andinus> ie to make the phaser active only if $c is defined
[14:23:10] <moon-child> my $c = ...; LEAVE $c.quit if $c
[14:23:12] <moon-child> ?
[14:25:36] <moon-child> though a restructuring might be in order.  Presumably you currently have something like:  my $c = connect...; LEAVE $c.quit; return unless $c; $c.send...; ...
[14:25:49] <moon-child> in that case, why not: my $c = connect... or return; LEAVE $c.quit; $c.send...; ...
[14:26:23] <andinus> oh, that makes sense, thanks
