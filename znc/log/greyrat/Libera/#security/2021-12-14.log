[07:14:26] <ajak> because establishing a secure connection over an insecure link is (understandably?) a very hard problem to solve
[07:17:04] <SEP> Unfortunately it's a constant in my life.  I work a lot with legacy so I find that whenever 1.1 is deprecated and shutoff, they don't tell you before hand until you can no longer work with the original product.  As for the problem, it is hard, and i'm less convinced that TLS really was the right method/tactic.  It's just infuriated.  I've had to stop doing everything just to move from 1.1 to 1.2, or update

[07:19:01] <ajak> if i was so far behind the curve on this i wouldn't be blaming TLS for it in any case
[07:19:19] <ajak> this is really one of the reasons legacy software is legacy
[07:22:29] <SEP> the real bother is i know when i move everything over 1.2, 1.3 will become a thing and there is undue amounts of pressure.  Since i work with legacy a lot I'm never current, it's impossible.  Since once i'm done working on one system, i move to another.  TLS is the reason in almost all instances which is why it annoys me.  I get it's important and i understand the usefulness.  But it comes down to execs
[07:22:35] <SEP> deciding that moving from 1.1 to 1.2 should take "no time at all" (not true with legacy a good portion of the time) as well as slowing development.  I don't hate TLS, i hate the idea that it's "critical" that it get updated as soon as possible while there are much more serious issues
[07:25:26] <ajak> you don't hate tls, right, you hate your execs

[07:28:00] <SEP> In hindsight, after venting, i agree with your statement, ajak.  It wears on you after getting an email for the 7th or 8th time this year telling you to stop what you are doing and fix something that broke because no one talks to you until they shut older versions of TLS off.  So yeah, I like some of my higherups, but i don't like the process.
[07:28:12] <ajak> who shut it off?
[07:28:14] *** Joins: baw (~baw@user/baw)
[07:28:18] <SEP> network admins
[07:28:33] <ajak> ask them to not do that without telling you?
[07:28:39] <ajak> or provide a timeline?
[07:28:53] <ajak> maybe even tell your execs to tell them
[07:29:36] <SEP> I've asked a few times, but there's enough churning that it only sticks for a short period of time.  Remote work in large orgs have caused a unique issue where info is more temporal it seems
[07:30:56] <ajak> then you have a good excuse if things aren't done to the liking of execs :)
[07:32:24] <SEP> Haha yes, I usually just apologize and let them know we will find a solution ASAP.  It is a nice buffer when I miss a deadline because i've been patching old software for the past month.  It's just a lot of extra and it's got me overwhelmed

[15:05:48] <shad> Hi, quick question about CSRF tokens. Context is a React front-end application on `my-proj.company.com` and a Flask API on `my-proj-api.company.com`. Isn't Cross Site Request Forgery not happening if I have CORS rules enabled ? Is having a `GET /csrf` route on my API that gives current JWT's CSRF token a bad idea ?
[15:05:59] <shad> How should I retrieve, store, a CSRF token ?

[15:29:14] <piou> shad: CORS cannot protect against CSRF. Normally a website can't access another website you're using (eg: reddit isn't able to read your bank details even if you're currently connected to your bank in another tab). This is a guarantee provided by the Same-Origin Policy (SOP), a fundamental of web browser design. Sometimes it's an issue, you actually want to allow other websites to access data
[15:29:20] <piou> from your website. In that case the best thing to do is to use CORS. CORS allows you to whitelist an access. It doesn't restrict anything, on the contrary, the restriction is already in place and CORS reduces it locally. CSRF is another beast. It's about using the limits of SOP to attack you. Specifically SOP prevents you from getting an answer from the website (so you can't steal data) but it
[15:29:26] <piou> doesn't prevent the request from being sent. Therefore if the request isn't about getting data but about making a change (say, change a password), then you can perform that request and any cookie will be sent alongside so it will be an authenticated request. That's what a CSRF attack is.

[15:31:34] <piou> shad: you should treat CSRF tokens as session tokens: they should be generated from strong randomness, at least 16 bytes (=128 bits), they should be specific to the user session and invalidated once the session ends, any session token rule applies really except one: CSRF tokens must not be passed through cookies. Or at least not only through cookies. That's because CSRF attacks work by relying on
[15:31:40] <piou> cookies so if you send the CSRF token the same way it won't prevent anything. A header or an invisible form field is a common way to send it.

[15:33:54] <shad> generating the CSRF Token is handled by Flask JWT Extended, and I trust them to do it, more than myself
[15:33:57] <piou> shad: Is a "GET /csrf" route a bad idea? Hard to say, it depends on the rest of your authentication. It does seem superfluous because you normally don't need to ask the website about your CSRF token, either it's dealt with as a session token and provided upon authentication, or it's integrated within the page through an invisible form parameter

[15:35:26] <shad> piou: in my current setup I "POST /login + { email, password }" from my front-end, then receive a JWT as HTTPOnly cookie that is used by next request to consume content
[15:35:58] <piou> OK, but the CSRF token must not be sent through cookies
[15:36:10] <shad> My frontend isn't serve by my API, by design, so i cannot embed CSRF in pages because they don't originate from the same place
[15:36:54] <shad> So yes, CSRF shouldn't be sent by cookies. So that means having a `GET /csrf` request originating from my front end and storing it in say localStorage should be fine.. right ?
[15:37:14] <piou> I don't see how that should work
[15:37:42] <piou> The cSRF token should be sent alongside all requests that change the server state (eg: change a password or create a user). That's when it should not be sent through cookies.
[15:38:24] <shad> yes, via header X-CSRF-TOKEN. Problem is, how do I make my javascript able to read that token ?

[15:39:07] <piou> What do you mean? If you stored it in your cookies or local storage you should have no trouble reading it from JS
[15:39:24] <shad> I had a first try at that with having the CSRF token being sent as response to POST /login and set that as session default header in axios, but if the user closes the tab, then the setting is lost

[15:42:01] <shad> passing the CSRF via Cookies is tricky because of the domain, and in dev you cannot set "localhost:3000 (eg my react app)" as a domain without tricky /etc/hosts configs that i'd rather avoid
[15:42:05] <shad> I
[15:42:58] <shad> So having the CSRF token passed via GET request seemed like an okay idea to me, but i can't data on why it isn't widespread usage in Front End + API request. Just wanted to know what security implications that would have
[15:43:30] <piou> There's not really an issue with /csrf at that point, as long as its sent to the server through something other than cookies that part should be good. Possible implementation issues after that are more akin to session management: making sure that the token is reserved to a user session etc... And of course making sure to require that CSRF token for every request that change state on the server.

[15:44:23] <piou> From my understanding it isn't a popular design simply because the best time to get a CSRF token is upon login, so that can be done through the regular /login point normally and doesn't need a separate endpoint.
[15:45:04] <piou> The duration of that token should be that of the session, so it makes sense to treat it in the same way.
[15:45:06] <shad> yes, probably should only need to set the csrf in localstorage at login time and use that value to do post requests
[15:45:21] <piou> That would be reasonnable.
[15:47:02] <piou> localstorage gets a bad rep, mainly due to arguments alongside "if there's an XSS it isn't protected as a HttpOnly cookie would" but if there's an XSS then you cannot prevent CSRF attacks anyway, XSS > CSRF, so that argument is moot here.
