[01:57:49] <Bayes> rickyrick re C++
[01:58:07] <Bayes> you mentioned that calling C code from inside a loop might not yield a large performance gain and that you'd typically move the whole loop into C land
[01:58:31] <Bayes> do you do any optimization? if so, do you call R's optim from C?
[02:01:07] *** Quits: rickyrick (~rickyrick@d23-16-13-108.bchsia.telus.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[02:01:14] <Bayes> cause in my use case, the one I have in mind right now at least, I have a logposterior that's slow to evaluate. if I were to rewrite the logpost(x, y) in C and optim from R, I worry that the overhead would make it meaningless
[02:02:01] <Bayes> because the x and y objects might be large, so I'd rather not copy them from R to C many times throughout the many times optim will call the underlying function
[02:23:35] <shrysr> SO ahem. i put together cool buncha pages on Confluence.. talking all about R/Python .. and Javaaa. 
[02:23:46] <shrysr> confluence is nice-ish. though PIA to edit in browser. 
[02:24:33] <shrysr> hmm i would really like Org documents exported to hugo sites or something. Or mebbe markdown. 
[02:26:59] <shrysr> Sucessfully created yet another thing that nobody gives a fuck about ! YAY

[17:19:29] <fendur> paper acceptance day \o/
[17:26:54] <confuzeus> congrats. what is it on? 
[17:28:29] <fendur> used a multiplier method to estimate prevalence of opioid use disorder in small areas.
[17:28:57] <fendur> part applied, part methodological
[17:29:07] <confuzeus> great. so its in the area of small estimation?
[17:29:39] <fendur> we didn't frame it that way, but i think it does sit among SAE type methods
[17:29:58] <confuzeus> cool
[17:31:01] <fendur> we used multiple sets of data to get something better than any one set could do. I think that's a lot of what SAE is about.
[17:32:58] <confuzeus> interesting.all good datasets or varying quality?
[17:34:06] <fendur> pretty good. we used a healthcare claims database, vital statistics death database, and some data from ACS that characterizes counties.
[17:41:22] <confuzeus> ok.

[19:11:20] <fendur> took forver
[19:11:32] <Bayes> why am I not surprised? lol
[19:19:59] <mefistofeles> what did I miss?
[19:20:22] <fendur> a really crazy night
[19:20:54] <mefistofeles> in #R? Then I didn't miss anything I guess

[20:41:25] <Bayes> why did you worry so much about the small area method, just run a neural net

[21:23:28] <rickyrick> Bayes: Somewhat, but you can always pass the x and y by reference
[22:05:58] *** Joins: baffodoro (~raffaem@45.91.20.238)
[22:48:29] <Bayes> rickyrick do you think top off your head that calling optim from R and passing x, y by reference shouldn't have a large performance hit versus calling R.h's optim in the C code?
[22:48:50] <Bayes> cause figuring out the right way to call optim from C can be a bit of a pain
[22:49:08] <rickyrick> Yeah I'd just try it with the log-posterior directly
[22:49:16] <Bayes> k
[22:49:24] <rickyrick> If that doesn't go well you can always call the C/C++ function from another C/C++ function
[22:49:27] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:49:35] <Bayes> also I was considering Ceres for optimization cause it has autodiff (｡◕‿‿◕｡)
[22:49:43] <rickyrick> So does pqR ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:49:49] <Bayes> what
[22:49:58] <Bayes> do you run pqR?
[22:50:02] <rickyrick> No (^:
[22:50:05] <rickyrick> I always take derivatives by hand
[22:50:06] <rickyrick> :^)
[22:50:14] <Bayes> oh f*** you
[22:50:27] <Bayes> that's cause you have them :P
[22:50:32] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:50:50] <Bayes> my derivative w.r.t. my parameters is like a function of a function of a function
[22:50:54] <rickyrick> ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
[22:51:27] <Bayes> by the time I get all the way down I'm just too dizzy to know what's going on
[22:51:59] <rickyrick> Such is life in the zone
[22:52:00] <Bayes> that said, having analytical derivatives can be such a sweet and lovely speed boost (｡◕‿‿◕｡)
[22:53:47] <Bayes> btw I always meant to ask, what zone is that rickyrick?
[22:53:55] <Bayes> cause basically every post apocalyptic setting has a zone
[22:54:24] <rickyrick> Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, now extra excludy
[22:54:26] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:54:33] <Bayes> :(
[22:55:33] <Bayes> agh can't come up with the name of the game
[22:55:34] <Bayes> it
[22:55:43] <rickyrick> Bayes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51skJUVj5s
[22:55:44] <Bayes> it's not Metro, it's the other one the old one
[22:56:11] <Bayes> stalker there u go
[22:56:20] <rickyrick> You mean S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[22:56:22] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:56:28] <Bayes> heh
[22:56:39] <Bayes> you looking forward for the one coming soon?
[22:57:07] <rickyrick> Yeah hopefully Bethesda doesn't shit it up like with Quake Champions
[22:59:26] <Bayes> bethesda? o_O
[22:59:50] <rickyrick> Property rights got sold to Bethesda iirc
[23:01:23] <Bayes> oh I didn't know this: "It was scheduled to release on December 8, 2022,[3] but due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, development for the game has been put on indefinite hold."
[23:02:01] <rickyrick> That makes sense
[23:02:37] <Bayes> yep, also I didn't know that the devs were ukranian themselves
