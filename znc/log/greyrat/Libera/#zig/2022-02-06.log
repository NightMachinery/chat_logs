[04:00:12] <cr1901> marler8997_: Okay zig from zigup can build windows-imager just fine :D. Somethings causing zigup to hang in build.zig when I try rebuilding zigup (for fun). Do you know where build.exe is located when building?
[04:01:53] <marler8997_> ooo that's bad
[04:02:33] <marler8997_> I believe you can add "-v" to see all the commands being run, then you can see the build.exe that was invoked
[04:03:18] <cr1901> -Dfetch doesn't matter... the build hangs after the ziget (first repo) is confirmed to be in the correct place
[04:03:58] <cr1901> Unrecognized argument: -v :(
[04:04:44] <marler8997_> oh, --verbose

[04:06:26] <cr1901> Hmmm, nothing of note
[04:07:49] <marler8997_> interesting, it kindof looks like maybe the build process is stuck waiting for the child process to exit
[04:08:33] <cr1901> Hmm interesting (btw, makes no difference if I use zigup or not, or I use a bash prompt or command prompt)
[04:08:50] <marler8997_> what do you mean by "use zigup"?
[04:09:15] <cr1901> Use the zig proxy (zigexelink)
[04:09:26] <marler8997_> oh gotcha, you know my secrets then
[04:09:48] <marler8997_> add a print statement in build.zig after this line: https://github.com/marler8997/zigup/blob/master/build.zig#L29
[04:10:45] <cr1901> Gimme a sec
[04:13:20] <cr1901> I added a print before and after
[04:13:24] <cr1901> the print before runs
[04:13:28] <cr1901> the print after doesn't
[04:13:59] <marler8997_> ok it does sound like it's not detecting that the child process that runs the "git" commands is exiting
[04:14:35] <cr1901> Should I clone ziget next and add a test case to see if I can dup?
[04:14:44] <cr1901> Not sure what that code should look like tho
[04:15:11] <marler8997_> let's double check, add some printing around here: https://github.com/marler8997/zigup/blob/master/GitRepoStep.zig#L187

[04:18:07] <cr1901> So, that function isn't being run at all (because I guess the GitRepoStep detected the repo was already there). But the build still hangs
[04:18:22] <marler8997_> it's running according to the output you sent me
[04:18:40] <cr1901> Yes, because that was a clean build (I just removed the deps dir)
[04:18:51] <cr1901> I haven't removed the deps dir since
[04:19:12] <marler8997_> I can only go by what you sent me, I'm assuming you're getting the same output unless you send me something different
[04:19:27] <cr1901> Okay, then lemme remove the deps dir each time (my fault)
