[14:29:49] <jinsun> you are not adding multiple values to '1', it is one dictionary
[14:29:56] <joo-_> also now that i am finally here i have been wanting to also ask what does the line numbers that starts at 1 and keep incrementing in ipython mean ? is it just line numbers? and can i navigate them ? go back to 0 ? why are they even there? it looks like same layout as in jupyter, but i never really "got that " either ?
[14:30:43] <p-i-> joo-_: It's cell execution order
[14:31:10] <joo-_> p-i-: can i change them inside python? can i go back to 0 or 5? or view it all in an editor and come back ?
[14:31:17] <p-i-> For ipython it doesn't really mean anything as AFAIK you can't go back, but in jupyter it's important to track.
[14:31:19] <jinsun> yeah not line numers, every time you execute a cell, the number beside them will change

[14:40:01] <Adoi> ah

[14:49:16] <supakeen> I don't like the dimensional name but so be it.
[14:49:25] <Adoi> jinsun,  s[0] = dict() doesnt help. it overwrites the original value of '0' in the dict with '{}'
[14:50:25] <kek_> so I use a script for data postprocessing which is parallelized with the multiprocessing module. I run it on a cluster where I requested 16 cores on the same CPU. Now I don't know multiprocessing module and it's intrinsics, so maybe one of you sees if there's an issue with the parallalization or the actual logic of the script. error: https://bpa.st/A4EQ Note: We are at element 48 which means we had already 4x16 iterations.  script in
[14:50:25] <kek_> question https://github.com/gwastro/ml-mock-data-challenge-1/blob/master/contributions/whiten.py note also that the work distributed is of different intensity, so maybe there's a missing blocking or something like that. (fileio is sequential though). Any hint is appreciated.

[14:52:50] <Adoi> so how can I solve this problem
[14:52:51] <Adoi> ?
[14:53:15] <jinsun> probably by using defaultdict like han-solo suggested
[14:53:49] <Adoi> supakeen, yes, nested seems to suit better
[14:54:08] <supakeen> Mostly because if you nest 4 times it becomes hard to reason about '4 dimensions' ;)
[14:55:33] <jinsun> you can also have a fancy defaultdict, which is defaultidicts all the way down, dd = lambda: defaultdict(dd), d= dd(), with arbitrary number of levels (probably limited by recursion limit)
[14:56:25] *** Quits: walterwhip (~www@user/walterwhip) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[14:56:35] <Adoi> just curious what is meant in python docs that defines 'setdefault(...)' as 'If key is in the dictionary, return its value.'
[14:57:37] *** Joins: rtsn (~nstr@user/rtsn)
[14:57:41] <Adoi> ok, 's.setdefault(0)' returns the value

[14:58:34] <jinsun> yes if 0 is already there in s, it just returns it
[14:58:37] <Adoi> interestingly, 's.setdefault(0, {}), too
[14:58:51] <Adoi> but 's.setdefault(0, {})[7]' does not

[14:59:13] <Adoi> or, rather 's.setdefault(0, {})[7] = 4; s'

[15:01:43] *** Quits: walterwhip (~www@user/walterwhip) (Client Quit)
[15:01:57] <Adoi> precisely. what is for me interesting and still unknown all the time is that why 's.setdefault(1, {})[2] = 6' returns a different result from 's.setdefault(0, {})[7]=4'
[15:02:23] <Adoi> different in that one works and the other not
[15:03:28] *** Joins: slisnake (~slisnake@103.107.198.140)
[15:04:49] <jinsun> the behavior is that, if the key doesn't exist, it gets set to the default value you supplied, then the value for the key is returned
[15:05:24] <jinsun> so the behavior depends a lot on which keys exist in s, and what their corresponding values are
[15:07:04] <jinsun> print s before doing those operations, to see the keys and values in it, and it should be clear why it is behaving like it is
[15:08:01] <Adoi> so, since '1' has a dictionary (key,value pair) as its value, I can nest it further, but since '0' has an integer as its value, it cannot be nested further, therefore  's.setdefault(0, {})[7]=4' fails

[18:55:40] <p-i-> Macuser: Python unpacks containers into comma-separated variables. `foo, bar = [1, 2]` or `foo, bar = 'hello world'.split()`. I wasn't being obnoxious by suggesting you RTFM. It's important to be aware of the basic moves the language makes available to you. Just seeing them once, you'll retain a memory that there is a clean way to do something.

[21:45:04] <foo> Perhaps someone else can verify -> we want to move to rq because a sync loop to execute stuff doesn't make the most sense. It sounds like we can run an rq task that runs every second, if a date/time matches, then execute - for recurring events. Does this sound like a "best practice" ?
[21:45:14] <foo> or is that acceptable? Or do we use rq + cron for cron-like tasks?
