[02:15:41] <DOMF> yeah same
[02:15:59] <artao> as far as i'm concerned, if a movie isn't good in shitty quality it's not actually a GOOD movie
[02:16:02] <DOMF> and since the only other option is to wait until it goes online (which I'm guessing won't be until like march at the earliest) this will do just fine
[02:16:15] <artao> oh, a screener copy could hit any day too
[02:16:27] <DOMF> I haven't seen screeners in years

[02:16:45] <DOMF> I mean now would be the time for them

[02:18:39] <artao> he's got the chattter down pretty well
[02:19:13] <artao> why tony made him "leader" tho? WTAF no
[02:19:16] <artao> he's  a kid
[02:19:25] <artao> super ridiculously powerfl kid, but still
[02:20:23] <artao> i just waqtched shang-chi the other day. lloking forward to ee how they're included with everything else
[02:20:44] <artao> and if maguire's spidey is in there?
[02:21:02] <artao> i can't wait to see how holland and garfielsw's spideys react to his webs being biological
[02:21:03] <artao> lol
[02:21:14] <artao> wait what? that's just part of you? :O
[02:24:39] <artao> i can't wait to see what the cats think of the plasma ball
[02:25:26] <artao> put it down on the floor and surround it with fresh catnip
[02:26:44] <DOMF> Holland is definitely my favorite live action spider man
[02:26:45] <MusicalDillo> a more tempting target than a laser pointer?
[02:26:59] <DOMF> but spiderverse... it's so goddamn good
[02:27:02] <artao> oh, they love the laser pointer too
[02:27:07] <DOMF> I still haven't seen shang-chi yet
[02:27:10] <artao> they can interact with the plasma ball tho
[02:27:12] <DOMF> Guess I should watch that first?
[02:27:17] <artao> oh, shang-chi is excellent
[02:27:31] <artao> just keep in mind that it's a kung fu movie more than a superhero movie
[02:27:32] <DOMF> I can't remember if I downloaded it or not yet
[02:27:50] <artao> i'd say yes, watch shang chi first
[02:27:56] <DOMF> aah yeah I did ok
[02:28:00] <artao> tho i have no idea if it has any relevance to no way home
[02:28:02] <DOMF> I'll watch that this weekend
[02:28:09] <artao> speaking of which tho, perhaps i should watch Eternals first
[02:28:12] <artao> hmm
[02:28:13] <DOMF> not tonight though, cause DISCOVERYYYYYY
[02:28:19] <DOMF> oh yeah i need to watch eternals too
[02:28:20] <DOMF> damn
[02:28:26] <artao> discovery?
[02:28:49] <artao> also, i dunno if i should watch Falcon & Winter Solder and Loki first
[02:28:58] <artao> i've watched Wandavision, and it was fucking awesome
[02:29:14] <artao> i never finished Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D. either
[02:29:50] <DOMF> Star Trek: Discovery
[02:29:59] <artao> ah
[02:30:00] <DOMF>   <artao> also, i dunno if i should watch Falcon & Winter Solder and Loki first <-- Loki for SURE

[02:30:08] <artao> :P
[02:30:15] <artao> hm. mk
[02:30:20] <artao> but ..... he's dead
[02:30:22] <DOMF> The ending of Loki is pretty obviously a tie-in to the next Spiderman, Dr Strange, and POSSIBLY spiderverse
[02:30:26] <artao> or not? :O
[02:30:27] <DOMF> who's dead
[02:30:28] <DOMF> oh
[02:30:30] <artao> AHH mk cool
