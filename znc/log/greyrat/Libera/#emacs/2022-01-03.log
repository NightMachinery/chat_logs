[02:22:58] <mmalter> Hello guys. I am making the switch to graphical emacs and I was wondering how did you change your gtk3 theme. I have tried changing .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini but apparently emacs does not care much.

[02:37:45] <pjb> samlamamma: well, the important point of symbol macros is that they are lexical bindings, that you can shadow with let. So you can use them to implement something that looks like global lexical variables.  But it could be done with other mechanisms.

[02:38:31] <pjb> samlamamma: from the point of view of elisp, the problem is that this requires some global lexical scopes.  Probably file-based, but emacs lisp is not very much file based (even if we have -*- lexical-binding:t -*- on a file basis…
[02:38:32] <pjb> )
[02:38:40] <Unicorn_Princess> it seems like i can add/remove root dirs (treemacs calls them 'projects') in treemacs by focusing the treemacs buffer, then C-c C-p a(add)/d(remove) a project. so to 'switch', i add a new dir, and remove an old one. now the initial C-c thing is not very discoverable (but does bring up a spacemacs menu of new shortcuts), and it also seems like a lot of work for something as trivial as switching the treemacs root dir. am i 
[02:38:40] <Unicorn_Princess> missing something? this shouldn't be so hard.
[02:39:31] <edgar-rft> mmalter: I'm using gtk2 but many emacs display things are done directly via X, not Gtk, so most of my Emas settings are in .Xresources, not .gtkrc - There's a new Emacs "pgtk" (pure gtk) branch that uses GtK exclusively for everything (mainly beause distros are switching from X to Wayland) but I have no idea how if that already works at least semi-reliably.

[04:52:37] <grym> Aurora_v_kosmose: in my world, you _need_ nvidia's proprietary drivers 
[04:52:45] <grym> which (afaik) are xorg only 
[04:52:53] <JTR[m]1> so! yes. org attach has a function that "translates" IDs into folders. 
[04:53:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> grym: Wasn't there work for nvidia drivers to use some other interface underway?
[04:53:27] <JTR[m]1> These are stored in org-attach-id-to-path-function-list from what I understand

[04:54:06] <twrk> th!e.w;or,ld/needs(more.punctuation!]
[04:54:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Seems to be with the modesetting driver & it uses the nvidia proprietary drivers.
[04:55:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *modesetting driver mode with the proprietary drivers.
[04:55:11] <JTR[m]1> What it does is creates a dir with the first two characters of the ID, and inside of it, the rest of the ID. so say you have an ID like 20220102T2024... something like that (because I changed it to use ISO dates) - it means it will open a dir, 20, and under 20 you'll have 220102T.... the rest of it for each header (each ID)
[04:55:41] <JTR[m]1> now, I wonder if there's a way to change that first dir, the 20 part. It doesn't make much sense, unless I live over a 100, to see this folder at all. don't need it.

[07:06:59] <homerj> well, other ways, I think drop.com is probably the most "legit" there is on this stuff

[07:14:49] <homerj> I never done any of it, I have some goofy MT3 profile keycaps, but I just bought them off Amazon
[07:15:30] <homerj> mostly because the set had a caps-lock width control key
[07:15:50] <ryuslash> homerj: what's MT3 profile?
[07:16:12] <homerj> https://drop.com/buy/drop-mt3-black-on-white-keycap-set
[07:16:39] <homerj> I have those, except the exact opposite (white on black)
[07:16:49] <ryuslash> ah ok
[07:18:16] <homerj> my Windows keys are replaced with the "Fn" and "CMD" keys
[07:18:32] <homerj> because the Fn swaps between layers
[07:18:50] <homerj> which brings up a PROTIP
[07:19:41] <homerj> if you are somewhere where you generally have people around, waste a keyboard layer on some scrambled keys...so if you have to type in a password, you don't have to do the "hide the keyboard from view" nonsense
[07:20:38] <ryuslash> homerj: nice hehe, I kinda already do that by having unmarked keys and using colemak. People are always confused when they try out my keyboard :)

[18:50:57] <Bayes> for we seem to have similar new year resolutions
[18:51:07] <Bayes> :P
[18:51:52] <Bayes> so basically I got to a point where, AFAIK, there's no good direct way to make magit read from a git folder that's not named .git
[18:51:55] <zeraphel> my resolution was revisiting emacs :)  i have written a vim-script to handle this to some extent years ago
[18:52:13] <Bayes> there's a 2012 github feature request for that

[18:53:43] <wasamasa> honestly, as an emacs user you'd be better off using okcupid
[18:53:55] <Bayes> zeraphel what's the issue then?
[18:53:55] <wasamasa> they offer "C++" and "LISP" as spoken languages
[18:54:19] <wasamasa> doesn't force you to use any app
[18:54:23] <zeraphel> Bayes: specifying where the worktree (the files of the bare  repo) are located
[18:55:24] <Bayes> zeraphel yeah so apparently magit uses git with some env variables under the hood for everything
[18:55:43] <Bayes> so you gotta tweak the env vars

[19:17:57] <zeraphel> Bayes: the snippet you linked to seems to work great,  with Fugitive even when the variables are set up the contents of a bare repository are not listed in the main buffer even tho everything else works fine
[19:18:45] <zeraphel> I think i'll try revamping it into a function to explicitly open that repo,  besides that.. I'm satisfied
[19:19:31] <Bayes> zeraphel oh yeah that sounds like the best way, I was thinking of a function that you'd call to open magit at this very specific repo
[19:20:53] <Bayes> let home, let git dir, push, push

[20:24:19] <soren_> twb: with unnamedplus, yank/copy/delete/put operations are associated with the system clipboard. An unwanted side-effect is an action as simple as 'x' to delete a character in vim will replace the contents of the system clipboard. with 'unnamed', instead, those operations are associated with the primary selection ("x clipboard"?) which is lower priority for most people's eyes and leaves the system
[20:24:21] <soren_> clipboard's contents untouched

(i'm asking because i'd like to change them to something more useful. especially the latter one i'd prefer if it was current_line/total lines, or something 
[21:46:16] <Unicorn_Princess> similar)

[21:54:26] <bkhl> Em, no I'm wrong.
[21:54:38] <bkhl> size-indication-mode replaces that function but is not the default one.
[21:55:28] <bkhl> If you click the text you get a drop down to enable/disable some minor modes, one of them says "Display size indication". From that I gathered that mode name.
[21:55:59] <Unicorn_Princess> must be different in spacemacs, i get no such drop-down

[23:12:25] <technomancy> you can use apt, but not to install the compiler, just to install pacman, which then installs the compiler
[23:13:25] <corwin> I'm not sure what that's better than but I'm afraid of it.

[23:14:00] <technomancy> corwin: "grab this unsigned executable off a phpBB thread" is what I was expecting
[23:14:07] <lispmacs[work]> hi, I'm trying to use telegram for the first time through emacs-telega. But I'm confused how to create a telegram account. Can I do that through telega itself?
[23:14:20] <corwin> technomancy: and indeed, that's terrifying.

[23:17:19] <technomancy> could be discord instead of phpbb
[23:18:28] <corwin> I'll just pretend I didn't even read that, shall I.  (Even my 5yo uses discord occasionally.)
[23:19:40] <corwin> lispmacs[work]: I suspect not; I'd assume you need to use a usual telegram sigh-up method (e.g. web.telegram.org) then go from there.

[23:38:04] <akater[m]> Not tested for a long time, though.
[23:39:46] <acdw> hey is org-contacts still a good way to do contacts in org, or in general? asking b/c it's still pretty undocumented.
[23:40:43] <aidalgol> When did the I-ramble-my-badly-scripted-opinion-of-some-insignificant-issue-into-my-webcam-for-way-too-damn-long format on youtube start?
[23:41:06] <aidalgol> Because I hate it.  I hate it so much.  These all should have been a damn blog post.

[23:42:26] <lispmacs[work]> akater[m]: maybe I misunderstood telegram. one must be able to receive a text-message login code to register an account...?
[23:42:55] <acdw> yeah aidalgol that's like OG youtube
[23:43:07] <aidalgol> grym: OK, let's take this history lesson a little further.  When did these dipsticks start buying fancy-looking microphones and headphones and pretending they're in a radio station?

[23:44:50] <aidalgol> The ones I hate the most are the pretentious ones that think they're an important talk show, but they're just some jackass in their bedroom with overpriced and overkill audio equipment.
[23:44:52] <acdw> aidalgol as far as i knew that was like, always what youtube was. though,,,, you know what, it might've coincided with the rise of podcasts
