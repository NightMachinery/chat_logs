[02:07:41] <andyandyandy> we recently made an update to some code that was using an `.only` then asking for a field not included in the `.only`, incurring an additional query for each access. we removed the `.only`, which reduced from `n` queries to 1, but according to APM (new relic) the amount of time spent in the query is still ~ the same—previously 16.7 SELECTs per transaction averaging 75ms, now .573 SELECTs per transaction averaging 53.8ms.
[02:07:41] <andyandyandy>  any ideas why a ~30x reduction in # queries is only leading to a 70% reduction in time spent querying?
[02:08:19] <andyandyandy> sorry, 30% reduction in time spent querying*

[02:17:31] <andyandyandy> after running some tests it looks like it's probably because the initial filter (that was being .only'd) is the slow part, and the individual lookups are looked up using FK so they're really quick. so rather than reducing to 1/17 * 75ms it's more like 1/17 * 20ms

[10:07:24] <audio> schinckel, thanks
[10:10:37] <GinFuyou> why you need on debug page though? you can always print \ log any var from you code, or check context with django-debug-toolbar

[10:25:33] <FunkyBob> serafeim: maybe they've promoted it from just fields to whole forms now?

[10:53:37] <audio> FunkyBob, the RecursionError is shown in the "interactive view" of the traceback (local vars) of the debug page, when looking at "self"
[10:56:44] <shangxiao> lol shoutcaps
[10:59:11] <shangxiao> yes the interactive view will be getting the repr of arguments, etc

[11:18:35] <shangxiao> so this: return str({key: getattr(self, key) for key in dir(self)})

[11:52:25] <serafeim> i want to save a location in my postgresql database. i don't care about using postgis
[11:52:31] <serafeim> what should i use ?
[11:56:26] <serafeim> a `PointField` seems to be available only on postgis
[11:57:09] <serafeim> should i just save the location as two decimal fields ?
[11:57:58] <GinFuyou> Coordinates? That what I did
[11:58:06] <shangxiao> audio: convert the dictionary from vars to a string
[11:58:21] <serafeim> GinFuyou: thanks i just thought that i could use PointField or something
[11:58:52] <GinFuyou> I guess FloatField also works.
[11:59:27] <serafeim> hmmm yes
[11:59:36] <serafeim> it should work since you don't need to be exact
[11:59:48] <serafeim> the thing is that for each point i'll need to save two fields on my db
[12:02:21] <serafeim> why can't i use PointField from a normal postgresql ? it seems here https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-geometric.html that the geometric datatypes are available in postgresql

[14:02:59] <LordKalma> I have a tangential question... Its like... If you have an api powering your website, like DRF, with, say, a SPA fronted of some sort... How do you keep people from abusing the api and navigating the websites data programmatically?

[14:06:49] <luigibu> yes.. I was thinking on it.. thanks ktosiek[m]
[14:07:24] <ktosiek[m]> LordKalma: first you make sure that the API only exposes the things you want exposed
[14:08:01] <ktosiek[m]> other than that, you can use throttling to at least slow them down :-)
[14:15:33] <luigibu> ktosiek[m]: i forket the package, I will update it, and how i can use my forked version instead the one installed by my pipfile? tks
[14:16:49] <ktosiek[m]> pipenv install git+http://my.repo/mypackage@branch
[14:17:02] <ktosiek[m]> Or something like that, you can install from git

[14:17:12] <luigibu> sounds food
[14:17:16] <luigibu> jaja.. good
[14:17:18] <LordKalma> Hahah I was wondering like, how places like Facebook messenger, telegram Web app... All SPAa.. They mustt protect their backend somehow, right?
[14:17:37] <ktosiek[m]> luigibu: and for testing you can use `install -e path/to/local/copy`
