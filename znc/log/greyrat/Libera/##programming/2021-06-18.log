[04:32:05] <phogg> what is accepted in academia and the compsci community hasn't penetrated the whirlwind of line-of-business programming, but it will
[04:32:30] <jeaye> InPhase: Function overloading provides specialization. Are you also saying that's OOP?
[04:33:07] <InPhase> Generally "encapsulation, specialization, and polymorphism" are the generalized ways to describe the categories of features of OOP.  Inheritance is just one way to achieve specialization used prominently under some langauges, and less prominently (ranging through not at all) in other approaches to it.
[04:33:28] <phogg> jeaye: that's polymorphic behavior, so in part yes
[04:34:09] <jeaye> That's a useless definition, then.
[04:34:17] <jeaye> void* is polymorphic. char is polymorphic.
[04:34:33] <jeaye> identity is polymorphic.
[04:34:44] <W> thing is, different parts of the ecosystem evolve at different speeds. Textbooks and backwards-compatible languages may still use inheritance (implementation inheritance, inheritance as code reuse and specialization), but at the front of best practices and practical programming, almost everyone agrees on composition over inheritance, and the next big OOP language may not have implementation inheritance at all
[04:34:47] <jeaye> None of these things are helpful at all, relating to OOP.
[04:34:49] <InPhase> jeaye: Well, it can, yes.  There are people who argue that universal function call syntax with function overloading is sufficient to create OOP if you also have some encapsulation mechanism.
[04:35:02] <phogg> jeaye: void* isn't the same as overloading
[04:35:10] <InPhase> jeaye: There are levels of syntactical sugar quality.
[04:35:39] <jeaye> phogg: It's not much different than run-time polymorphism, so it must be OOP.

[04:40:43] <jeaye> C++ is a great example of the limitations of inheritance. It still exposes all of the baggage of C, with an additional interface.
[04:40:51] <phogg> W: I hope you're right, but I don't expect it
[04:40:52] <Izem> oof
[04:43:11] <arahael> jeaye: the fragilities of OOP, i would say. C++ does do OOP fairly well though its somewhat adhoc in parts for my liking (abstract classes, interfaces, etc)
[04:43:30] <InPhase> phogg: Consider that you want to make a special value-added vector.  The classic inheritance approach is to make a subclass of your Vector class, and add an extra few methods or something.  But what you REALLY want to do, is make a class, embed Vector members into it, and declare that it obeys some of the same concepts as a Vector like being iterable and integer indexable, so that it can be used in 
[04:43:36] <InPhase> any context requiring those behaviors.
[04:44:21] <phogg> W: providing more options about how composition can be done is a nicety that any language might provide, unless it has an ideological bent against it
[04:44:53] <InPhase> phogg: Inheritance says that you should be able to treat it like it's a vector, pre-defining it as a special case of a vector.  But, really, you just want it to be a thing that satisfies integer indexable.  Not everything that does needs to have full Vector compatibility.
[04:45:09] <phogg> InPhase: given a language that can do that I can bolt classical inheritance on without effort, and the language may choose to provide syntax for doing so as well
[04:45:51] *** Joins: jacks- (~bc817c21@217.29.117.252)
[04:45:52] <InPhase> phogg: But classical inheritance is at that point a distraction from the core things you are actually trying to do, which is declaring common concepts for behavior.
[04:46:09] <InPhase> And, code reuse, which is basically just importing pieces of things.
[04:46:23] *** Quits: JavaBean (~JavaBean@user/javabean) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:47:04] <W> something the Java API designers still hasn't quite got as well. Interfaces should be small. Make more of them, if necessary, but no interface should need to have 20 methods beyond being a grouping interface for other interfaces
[04:47:07] <phogg> InPhase: and yet, to appeal to the existing programmer population, it may be expedient to provide it. It's pretty harmless to do so
[04:47:12] <InPhase> phogg: I think inheritance will come to be viewed as a narrow case of something more general we are actually looking for.
[04:47:28] <phogg> InPhase: I agree
[04:48:13] <phogg> W: the ideal width of an interface is one member. You can always combine them, after all.
[04:49:07] <W> https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#method.summary look at this monstrosity, for just having an abstract data collection, 27 methods

[04:50:28] <jacks-> interesting to compare. I believe Foldable is haskell equivalent. it requires implementation of just one method, all other functions are derived from that. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.15.0.0/docs/Data-Foldable.html
[04:50:28] <Hitchens> Link: Data.Foldable
[04:50:34] <W> at the _very_ least it should be split into read-only and modifiable interfaces
[04:50:59] <W> jacks-, not quite equivalent, Java has simpler interfaces for that kind of thing
[04:51:23] <jacks-> what does it do that Foldable doesn't?
[04:51:46] <W> e.g. Iterable has three methods, and it would be just one if not for new language features and backwards compatibility
[04:52:20] <W> jacks-, random access, mutation
[04:52:55] <jacks-> at a glance, Iterable doesn't have nearly as much functionality. so Foldable sits somewhere in between
[04:53:41] <W> yes, just saying, there ARE smaller interfaces for smaller feature sets, not that there's any one-to-one mapping
[04:54:00] <jacks-> that's true
[04:54:52] <W> but List could have been split into three, four, possibly more, smaller interfaces, and just have the one group them together for convenience
[04:55:29] <W> when you actually implement it yourself, you typically want to implement just one or two of the methods
[04:56:03] <W> (and Java's idiomatic way to get around that is indeed implementation inheritance, using AbstractList)

[05:33:32] <PlanckWalk> I've never been anywhere that even had 3 round formal interviews.
[05:33:37] <W> PlanckWalk, one or two places, but generally they've stuck to using it just for backwards compatibility
[05:33:53] <PlanckWalk> paulo_: What position are you interviewing for?
[05:33:58] <W> i.e. adding support for new features to old interfaces

[05:34:07] <PlanckWalk> W: Ah, okay.
[05:34:24] <PlanckWalk> paulo_: Anyway no, it would be insane to expect that.
[05:35:06] <W> (and, I mean, abstract classes are actually *better* than default methods, IMO. Both bad, but interface implementation additionally hinders thinking about code - no longer can you rely on interfaces being pure specification)
[05:35:43] <PlanckWalk> paulo_: It's much more likely that any practical tests are going to focus on programming than design.
[05:35:53] <PlanckWalk> And really short simple programming exercises at that.

[06:13:33] <InPhase> paulo_: We also do two more technical and one "final" round.  Honestly most of the weeding out happens during the first two, because right now a lot of people are just not doing adequately at technical interviews.  The final rounds are then more likely to be "What kind of person is this to work with?" and broader questions of how it would go to assign you various expected responsibilities of the 
[06:13:39] <InPhase> role.
[06:14:48] <InPhase> paulo_: Typically a much smaller number make it to the final round, and depending on policies it might only be one person in the final round (for an up/down vote), up through three candidates if required.

[08:47:42] <vdamewood> I'm excited, but an M1  is missing a few features I need.
[08:47:59] <Snyp> vdamewood: like which?
[08:48:06] <vdamewood> Mostly things like Memory support > 16 Gigs, and 3 or 4 TB controllers.
[08:48:48] <Snyp> ah. didn't know that. i'm sure the higher end systems with M1 will support those.
[08:48:48] <rindolf> and nopony gets banned for 'self-promotion' (go away, Fear!)
[08:48:50] <vdamewood> Though, I could use a T1 with 16 Gigs of memory and a 1TB ssd as a secondary system.
[08:49:10] <vdamewood> Snyp: It won't be M1. It will be M1X, M2, or something else.

[12:25:52] <nitrix> Alex123, The IPv4 space is split into multiple CIDR ranges. ISPs will buy these blocks as they see fit, so they could end up at two completely different geo locations.
[12:26:04] <orbatos[m]> even so, you'd need to look into who has what blocks
[12:26:10] <mrig> DNS are assigned blocks of ip's something like that.
[12:26:35] <nitrix> Alex123, There are databases online (e.g. MaxMind) to find out the location. Cloud providers (e.g. CloudFlare) also often adds the information within the incoming HTTP headers.

[15:02:15] <W> pyzozord, almost anywhere in the world, you can get a microwave internet link set up. Terrestrial, I mean.
[15:02:57] <arahael> I suspect a typo, anyway, was curious. :)  (The technical support was otherwise very good.)

[15:04:21] <mrig> pyzozord: I am intrigued by the programming lineage that steamed from the particular environment, moreso than any one person.
[15:04:42] <W> if you have the funds to move out into the forest, presumably you have the funds for a minor mast (if you don't have a line of sight to some tall point already) and an ISP in the nearest town eager to put up a point-to-point link for you
[15:04:55] <grom> |smlckz| it's not so much the syntax but fighting the compiler that won't do it's job.
[15:05:38] <mrig> pyzozord: glad that you posted that when you did, as it really does follow on well from the thought that as buttons increase, so does the complexity, exponentially; The notion that this can be reduced by a language is quite an interesting one.
[15:05:42] <|smlckz|> grom, it is doing its job. see the C standards.

[18:17:36] <GeDaMo> You can put terminals into raw mode which should give you a key as soon as it's pressed
[18:17:50] <terminalpusher> it is in raw mode but it still takes a short delay before it's there
[18:18:10] <mrig> W: well quite, a nice round 1/3, no hang on ...
[18:18:12] <GeDaMo> Maybe there's something in the terminal emulator settings
[18:18:21] <terminalpusher> just like in text input, hold the A key and it will print one A but then for the next As it will take a short delay before it repeatedly sends As because you hold it
[18:18:24] <GeDaMo> Repeat delay or something like that
[18:18:47] <terminalpusher> and that is what I want to work around but preferably in a cross-terminal way

[18:21:05] <mrig> That is easily understandable.

[20:22:15] <Twipply> pyzozord thanks for the link
[20:22:24] <Twipply> Also I'm doing this in C++
[20:22:39] <Twipply> I keep seeing conflicting ways to implement nodes
[20:22:45] <Twipply> and, I dunno
[20:22:46] <Twipply> halp
[20:23:11] <Twipply> Take an addition node for example, I see lots of examples with left & right children
[20:23:21] <Twipply> But I also see examples where the nodes have child & sibling
[20:23:30] <Twipply> So an addition node ends up looking more like a linked list
[20:23:36] <GeDaMo> I would have it as left and right
[20:23:42] <Twipply> 1 + 2 becomes + with a child of 1 that has a sibling of 2
[20:24:00] <Twipply> and the + node doesn't even know the 2 node exists

[20:24:13] <pyzozord> I'd do + as parent with two children left 1 and right 2
[20:24:30] <GeDaMo> That sounds more like summing a list than a binary addition
[20:24:45] <Twipply> Alrighty, so what about the function node
[20:24:51] <Twipply> The prototype is fine, I'm wondering about the body

[20:25:02] <Twipply> I keep seeing examples where the body is just a node like any other
[20:25:12] <Twipply> I don't know how a function body can have 2+ expressions that way
[20:25:32] <Twipply> Let's say the body is 1+2; 3+4;
[20:25:39] <Twipply> So, the body node is + with 1 and 2 for left and right
[20:25:42] <GeDaMo> Does it return something?
[20:25:44] <Twipply> and now 3+4 is just... nowhere?
[20:25:52] <Twipply> Where the hell does it live?
[20:26:08] <Twipply> void func() {1+2; 3+4;}
[20:26:21] <Twipply> No return, let's just imagine this
[20:26:28] <GeDaMo> You could see a function as a return with everything else being subexpressions
[20:26:31] <pyzozord> + is a binary operator so it has two children, there are unary operators like ++ which would have only one child. function's body will have as many children as it has top level expressions
[20:26:31] <InPhase> Twipply: Trees can have arbitrary numbers of ordered branches/leaves beneath each node.

[22:02:24] <nitrix> mendel_munkis, On a complete graph it has to be, no?
[22:03:10] <nitrix> mendel_munkis, The outside edges of the complete graph connects all of the vertices in a ring, wouldn't that count?
[22:04:03] <mendel_munkis> oh sure the existence is trivial, I am looking for things like length of.
[22:04:53] <nitrix> What do you mean the length? The edges have lengths?
[22:05:23] <nitrix> That's a different problem, now you're talking about travelling salesman problem.
[22:05:32] <mendel_munkis> err yeah, forgot to write the weighted in complete weighted graph.
[22:06:24] <mendel_munkis> almost, and information on optimizing the TSP for complete graphs seems non-existent.
[22:07:23] <nitrix> Mhhh... I think I know of just one particular place where that has been used: P2P.
[22:08:06] <nitrix> I think if you like at Chord and gossip algorithms, you might have some eureka moments. I'm not sure.
[22:08:15] <nitrix> *look
[22:09:09] <mendel_munkis> The only reason I can ever think of P2P needing a hamiltonion is for plausible deniability, and for that you would need a circuit not a path

[22:24:49] <pyzozord> actually there are 7 mentions of complete graphs in CLRS so maybe
[22:25:39] <pyzozord> but I wouldn't count on it, the problem sounded very niche, not like something that would included in standard textbooks

[23:11:29] <inky_> hard question, don't know how to not spoil (:
[23:12:14] <DPA> I just realized my wish may have been a bad idea. Like, the earth has 1g, or 9.8m/s^2, so an object will fall 9.8 times faster after having fallen 1 meter. But time runs way less than 9.8 times slower if I ascend 1 meter.
[23:12:14] <DPA> So 2 times faster running time over 5 meter would probably be a crushing high g force? Or is that not how it works?
[23:12:35] <pyzozord> inky_: oh come on! don't be like that :D
[23:13:23] <inky_> sincerely i don't know what to say.
