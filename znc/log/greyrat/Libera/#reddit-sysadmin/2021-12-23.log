[00:28:47] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Is there something that you HAVE to do in TF that you can't do in ansible?
[00:29:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> TF is like a shopping cart for resources
[00:29:07] <sd> 09<H​aise> you tell it what you want
[00:29:19] <sd> 09<H​aise> and Ansible is just icing on cake that configures those requested resources
[00:29:28] <Cl0udSanta> mistiry, they're... ok... I really hate terraform because no two modules reuse the same input data, and theres no translation language. ansible is ok, but doing certain things makes me want to rip my hair out
[00:29:51] <Cl0udSanta> sadly theres no good alternative to terraform, and we're definitely not getting away from ansible
[00:30:20] <sd> 09<H​aise> Cl0udSanta: what providers do you work with ?
[00:30:30] <Cl0udSanta> aws, gcp, azure

[00:30:41] <Cl0udSanta> and probably others this coming year

[00:31:21] <Cl0udSanta> fuck that

[00:32:45] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Once you have a good library of modules in TF life gets easy
[00:33:15] <Cl0udSanta> we pretty much dont use any tools the way anyone else does I've come to realize
[00:33:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lots of tools really bury the lede in terms of their true value
[00:34:14] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> the value of TF isn't automating infra deployments, it's writing and sharing modules
[00:34:20] <Cl0udSanta> like, terraform, we built it up with a wrapper that makes sure that every instance has its own tfstate so that it doesnt fuck with any other instances when their data isnt around
[00:34:32] <Cl0udSanta> ansible.. we do terrible terrible things with ansible
[00:34:45] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> how are you storing the tfstate?
[00:35:29] <Cl0udSanta> we make a dir for each instance that the devs standup, and store the tfstate and tfvars from that run there, then the wrapper just requires the instance name to do teardown instead of all the things
[00:35:59] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> ughhhhh storing tfvars
[00:36:15] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> please tell me no keys or passwords
[00:36:18] <Cl0udSanta> everything is piecemeal, as it were. the disks tfstate is a different tfstate from the instance tfstate
[00:36:21] <Cl0udSanta> no
[00:36:40] <Cl0udSanta> its literally just shit like instance name, type, disk sizes, location, bullshit
[00:36:52] <Cl0udSanta> theres no provision process needed, the instance is automagical
[00:37:23] <Cl0udSanta> and the service account info for terraform is pulled from vault

[06:18:25] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[06:18:25] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[06:18:25] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All the so-calle
[06:18:31] <cryptic1> d “Linux” distributions are really distributions of Log Forge/Linux

[09:52:24] <epony> floppies from teh start
[09:52:28] <Hunterkll> i fucking love tapes
[09:52:45] <epony> the last tape I used was.. paper tape in teletypes
[09:52:45] <Hunterkll> throughput and storage capacity wise , plus retention time
[09:52:51] <epony> and ink tapes on them
[09:52:59] <epony> I FUCKING HATE TAPES
[09:53:07] <Hunterkll> yea... i'm doing 18TB in a less than a 3.5" HDD space for 7+ year expected lifetime...
[09:53:22] <epony> my HDDs live 25 years ;-_)
[09:53:36] <Hunterkll> only need, 7, and far cheaper than HDDs
[09:54:01] <epony> still got my ST225 (20MB) from 1986-1990 epoch working
[09:54:06] <Hunterkll> heh
[09:54:13] <Hunterkll> i'm  using LTO-8 stuff at work
[09:54:16] <Hunterkll> LTO-5 at home
[09:54:25] <epony> I love optical disc though!
[09:54:35] <Hunterkll> i couldn't afford HDD or optical media to back up my shit
[09:54:41] <Hunterkll> at home, that is
[09:54:57] <epony> tapes were only fun on mini-DV and because I could ingest them at 4x native data speed
[09:55:00] <Hunterkll> at work we've got an 18 drive unit per rack row 
[09:55:08] <epony> FW400
[09:55:12] <Hunterkll> epony: ever use miniDV for data backup?
[09:55:16] <epony> in year 2K
[09:55:18] <Hunterkll> i had an app on my iBook G4 to do that
[09:55:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:55:23] <epony> no
[09:55:27] <Hunterkll> using my sony camcorder
[09:55:33] <Hunterkll> which also worked as a full miniDV deck
[09:55:35] <epony> I used them for news production 1998-2002
[09:56:03] <Hunterkll> but it was over FW400
[09:56:05] <epony> ran a TV station and converted it to cable ISP and digital VoD service
[09:56:09] <Hunterkll> used image data to encode disk data
[09:56:15] <Hunterkll> but yea
[09:56:15] <Hunterkll>  
[09:56:22] <Hunterkll> modern tape is so fucking cheap and reliable
[09:56:28] <Hunterkll> once you get over the drive/library cost
[09:56:35] <Hunterkll> depends on how many snapshots/periods you need to retain
[09:56:44] <epony> right, I used tapes for the DV camcorders and tape decks for ingestion in parallel
[09:57:01] <epony> and then it was all PCs and from edit to live air
[09:57:12] <epony> with 24GHz uplinks
[09:57:33] <epony> so stored legacy video on VHS
[09:57:56] <epony> and circulated ones on HDDs
[09:57:59] <Hunterkll> ah
[09:58:13] <epony> fun times
[09:58:19] <Hunterkll> i'm talking LTO tape... we're talking 300-400MB/sec data transfer rates, 12TB+ raw without compression, etc
[09:58:22] <epony> then went into PCB production
[09:58:32] <Hunterkll> waiting for LTO-9 drives
[09:58:37] <epony> and then data centre ISP
[09:58:40] <Hunterkll> 18TB raw, 45TB compressed 
[09:58:53] <Hunterkll> same formfactor
[09:59:01] <Hunterkll> compressed 1GB/sec 
[09:59:07] <epony> you're just reusing work stuff at home ;-)
[09:59:11] <epony> you don't need it
[09:59:19] <Hunterkll> i'm talking about for work
[09:59:24] <epony> ah OK
[09:59:26] <Hunterkll> we offsite ourselves, store ourselves, etc 
[09:59:30] <epony> then it's the jaaab
[09:59:34] <epony> cool
[09:59:43] <Hunterkll> do media conversion, and reduce storage footprint by half, just like LTO-8 did before
[09:59:50] <epony> right
[09:59:58] <epony> that thing is possible on tapes
[10:00:11] <Hunterkll> we put our old sh it to iron mountain, of course, but we keep like 2 yrs of tapes onsite +copies in iron mountain 
[10:00:24] <epony> on HDDs you do it with resampling for nearline
[10:00:29] <epony> and newer codecs
[10:00:46] <Hunterkll> but either way, tape is super cost effective for us 
[10:00:54] <Hunterkll> and more reliable than our fucking data domain system 
[10:00:56] <epony> it is indeed
[10:01:01] <Hunterkll> or the other D2D systems
[10:01:30] <Hunterkll> we do rarely have to touch tape, but when we do, it's because we need to pull something ancient .... 
[10:01:36] <Hunterkll> basically we to D2D2T
[10:01:42] <Hunterkll> or D2C2T 
[10:01:44] <epony> the HDD is like a Vynil disc with the phonodeck
[10:01:45] <Hunterkll> or C2D2T
[10:01:52] <epony> in 3.5" and 2.5"
[10:02:11] <epony> the tape is like a VHS built well
[10:02:18] <epony> so it's very cheap
[10:02:21] <Hunterkll> tape, with how we store it, is like, "here's the master archive.... let us pray and load it.... beginning of tape marker found.... let us load" 
[10:02:25] <Hunterkll>  yea
[10:02:30] <Hunterkll> VHS was a shitshow for integrity 
[10:02:33] <Hunterkll> but it worked for video data
[10:02:35] <epony> and is 1 roll only
[10:02:36] <Hunterkll> and that's what counted
[10:02:51] <epony> like magnetophone tapes
[10:03:00] <epony> in boxes that are part of the tape assembly
[10:03:25] <Hunterkll> i've yet to have an LTO tape break on me 
[10:03:32] <Hunterkll> but I also replace 'em after 30 full reel runs 
[10:03:43] <epony> it's nice but, a bit expensive for individuals to have the decks and they are delicate mechanics (you can't self-service it at home)
[10:04:00] <Hunterkll> drives under support, still far cheaper than HDD 
[10:04:15] <epony> 2-5K/pc
[10:04:30] <Hunterkll> ah we're talking datacenter level

[10:05:16] <Hunterkll> though in the era of DDS tapes
[10:05:18] <epony> but it's stupid, cause it's cheaper to take out the HDD ;-)
[10:05:21] <Hunterkll> per-desktop backup was affordable 
[10:05:27] <epony> and put a new one in
[10:05:27] <Hunterkll> and cheaper than HDD
[10:05:30] <Hunterkll> but that was DDS tapes 
[10:05:51] <epony> I use the network since 1995
[10:05:59] <epony> for data transit
[10:06:25] <Hunterkll> I actually have a USB DDS drive from HP 
[10:06:29] <Hunterkll> to read old backup tapes
[10:06:37] <epony> so, never had to do video rentals, never had to buy CD-ROMs software..
[10:07:01] <Hunterkll> but DDS-4 was 20GB raw
[10:07:08] <Hunterkll> so a whole different ballpark than modern tape
[10:07:38] <Hunterkll> i'm using LTO-5 at home to compact my backup/cold storage because i can't afford that much HDD space with backup storage
[10:07:38] <epony> and pushed up own produce upwards the net
[10:08:05] <epony> and down to 10s of thousands

[10:08:33] <Hunterkll> tape's backup/cold/OS boot media 
[10:08:33] <epony> then switched them out, the many thousands are now in the net
[10:08:54] <epony> and the good stuff is on-prem
[10:09:04] <Hunterkll> bet there's no one awake now who's booted a system off of tape

[10:15:05] <sd> 08<G​ene> when the authors admit they're doing it because the studio is forcing them... like i mean...
[10:15:09] <sd> 08<G​ene> what hope do you have for the film?
[10:15:15] <sd> 08<G​ene> while they're admitting to this in the fucking film...
[10:15:15] <Hunterkll> that actually sounds awsome
[10:15:20] <Hunterkll> i appreciate when they do shit like that
[10:15:30] <sd> 08<G​ene> i think its lazy and ruins the story for time

[10:19:14] <epony> YT's like MTV in the 1990-1999
[10:19:47] <epony> nice but.. not amateur crap
[10:20:30] <Hunterkll> nah
[10:20:36] <Hunterkll> MTV was titties and music 
[10:20:39] <Hunterkll> in the 90s 
[10:20:48] <epony> real tits are nice
[10:21:10] <Hunterkll> GIRLS GON WILD ads every night

[10:26:57] <epony> with films there are 2 very important points:
[10:27:20] <epony> 1) you can't show the next years tech after the film is shot, it was not available last year
[10:27:38] <epony> 2) the story is really 10 years old and sucks mostly
[10:28:11] <epony> so, future settings is silly, it turns out like plastic toys
[10:28:37] <epony> and historic stories and backdrops are misrepresented and hollow
[10:29:05] <epony> the reality is films show you your previous decade with this years "tech stuff"
[10:29:37] <epony> so people in developing countries will know what they will be getting in the next 10 years (they live 20 years in the past)

[10:31:18] <epony> which is again a 5 year old film
[10:31:34] <epony> at best

[10:41:07] <SirSantalot> it was the second one that was super buggy, right?
[10:41:30] <epony> probably, but I was there for the ragdolls and gibs
[10:41:49] <epony> and the forst missions in delta force
[10:42:19] <epony> comanche/apache were novalogic too

[10:43:32] <epony> yeah, not bad for 1993
[10:43:56] <epony> the labirynth games were demon3d from a decade earlier
[10:44:24] <epony> and wolfenstein in 8bit PCs
[10:44:25] <JollyRgrs> descent was a great game. i played it every time i went to a friend's house
[10:45:13] <epony> yes, descent fit on a 3.25" FDD
[10:45:46] <epony> there was one dtrack and mach3d on 16bit PCs that were nice
[10:45:47] <JollyRgrs> a what?
[10:45:53] <JollyRgrs> you mean a 3.5?
[10:45:59] <JollyRgrs> it was 5.25

[10:47:21] <epony> but hated the price of the FDDs in hard variant
[10:47:35] <epony> the soft 5.25" FDDs were nearly free

[11:47:57] <epony> ah
[11:47:59] <SirSantalot> w... what? dos?
[11:48:02] <SirSantalot> lol
[11:48:10] <SirSantalot> there's this company that made a dos shell
[11:48:13] <epony> yep, DOS/WIN technically
[11:48:14] <SirSantalot> kinda grew big
[11:50:17] <epony> if it is any help, I'd pcap / tcpdump the network to see if it's flowing instead of pulling hairs waiting for CMD / GUI
[11:50:44] <csws> oh it's done
[11:50:48] <epony> or whatever flow / aggregation you use on your ciscoes
[11:50:54] <epony> ok
[11:51:12] <csws> it's normal because repadmin /replsum tries to talk to other DCs to figure out the replication delta but the firewalling is such this can only talk to a few centralised DCs
[11:51:51] <epony> so, is probably spending a lot ot time timing out on the ones that are not accessible
[11:52:05] <epony> inefficiencies
[11:52:07] <csws> yeah and it's not smart enough to just hit all of them at once, it goes one by one
[11:52:15] <epony> right
[11:52:19] <csws> eitherway it was just to prove that replication is now working
[11:52:22] <csws> now my feet are up
[11:52:24] <csws> waiting for 5:30
[11:52:49] <epony> now you can be an evil admin ;-)
[11:55:02] <epony> and plug the coffee heater in the UPS instead of the server
[11:55:31] <csws> oh I'm working from home today
[11:56:37] <epony> what laptop they get you for xmas?
[11:58:41] <csws> I'm on VDI :(
[12:01:00] <epony> RDP FTW w00t w00t
[12:01:19] <epony> bluekeep and spike proteins
[12:02:00] <epony> "SPICE" / VNC ;-)
[12:02:35] <DrZak> my company laptop doesnt allow for rdp
[12:02:48] <DrZak> i need something to connect to it hmmmm
[12:03:07] <DrZak> obviously nothing that also connects to the internets
[12:03:31] <DrZak> ah well, i'll just make an image off it and stick it inside a virtualbox
[12:03:38] <epony> there is X for Windows too
[12:04:05] <JollyRgrs> that's what i'm using now
[12:04:11] <epony> and SSH tunnelling is an option
[12:04:12] <JollyRgrs> terminator running off of WSL
[12:04:16] <epony> right
[12:04:22] <epony> LSW
[12:04:25] <DrZak> wait
[12:04:33] <DrZak> like, running X Org on windows
[12:04:38] <DrZak> and then connecting to it remotely?
[12:04:39] <epony> yes
[12:04:41] <JollyRgrs> there's a few different options
[12:04:51] <DrZak> hmmmmm
[12:04:57] <DrZak> it sounds like a great plan
[12:05:02] <JollyRgrs> vcxsrv i think is what i use
[12:05:10] <JollyRgrs> i get the letters confused sometimes
[12:05:17] <JollyRgrs> but i think it's visual c x serv
[12:05:18] <epony> you can both be a server (draw locally) or be a client (run appss and allow servers to draw them)
[12:05:28] <epony> in X they reversed the terminology
[12:05:40] <DrZak> i shall read up on that
[12:05:43] <epony> cause they did not well what they were doing and mixed up what is a server and client
[12:05:43] <DrZak> thx a bunch
[12:06:34] <epony> vnc must support ssl/tls for the internet, latencies are uncool, so you use compression and partial refresh / fill
[12:06:47] <epony> SPICE is better in that regard

[22:20:20] <Cl0udSanta> goddamn felt good to get a whole nights sleep for once. my dogs had the shits the last 3 days and kept wakin me up at ridiculous times
[22:20:46] <sd> 12<K​anye> at least your dog is not a gay fish
[22:20:54] <Cl0udSanta> facts
[22:21:13] <Cl0udSanta> that'd make him a gay dogfish if it were true
[22:22:24] <catbeard> fixed
[22:22:58] <killdash9> my dog is going through heartworm treatment and the meds make him have to piss avery 90 mins or so. Sleep? Waht's that?
[22:23:54] <Cl0udSanta> oof.. thats even worse lol. we'd go for a walk at like 8 or 9, and then he'd be pawin at me as we're goin to bed to go again, finally fall asleep and he paws me again
[22:24:36] <killdash9> at least he knows to wake you
[22:25:02] <Cl0udSanta> yeah. if he cant wake me, he learned (not from me) to go into the bathroom to shit
[22:25:05] <Cl0udSanta> its the strangest thing
[22:25:21] <killdash9> this is our Blue Heeler we rescued and are still training. He doesn't yet know how to ask to go out. Though he does know the word 'outside?' so we can ask and if he runs towards the door we know it's time
[22:25:51] <Cl0udSanta> mine wont usually paw at me for our normal dailies, I just ask him, but when hes gotta go, he definitely lets me know lol
[22:26:04] <killdash9> his big sister, our Dutch Shepherd, knows how to ask and will lick my hand in the middle of the night to go out
[22:26:29] <Cl0udSanta> oh I just suddenly feel like someone is watching me, and I open my eyes to see my dogs face inches from mine
[22:26:41] <sd> 12<K​anye> killdash9, sound like my wife
[22:26:43] <killdash9> luckily, that's usually pretty rare. I let them out when I go to sleep around 2am and my wife is up around 0700. So they really don't ever have a long wait
[22:27:15] <killdash9> the watching thing always creeps me out. Our last doggo did that
[22:27:26] <Cl0udSanta> its so fuckin creepy lol
[22:28:39] <Cl0udSanta> oi my ear is all plugged up
[22:35:51] <Cl0udSanta> goddammit its so fuckin irritating having to deal with buffering bullshit... ITS ALMOST FUCKING 2022, HOW HAS THE WORLD NOT FUCKING SOLVED THIS SHIT YET
