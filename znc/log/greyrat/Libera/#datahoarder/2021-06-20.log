[14:33:42] <scara> Oh that looks like a sata cable, does those work with HDDs?
[14:34:17] <joepie91> scara: to connect a SATA hdd in a desktop, you will need a free SATA power connector on your power supply (it probably has one unless you already have a lot of drives), and a SATA data cable, which are sometimes included with the drive but otherwise are easily available separately
[14:34:19] <NiLon> well it is external sata so..
[14:34:27] <scara> What I don't understand is why it says 2 meters here, I doubt it goes inside a computer
[14:34:36] <scara> "Eletra eSATA-kabel 2 meter"
[14:35:06] <joepie91> the length of SATA cable needed will vary depending on your case and its mounting locations, but most likely a 50cm or so cable is more than enough
[14:35:24] <joepie91> it just needs to go from the HDD to the SATA connector on the motherboard
[14:35:30] <NiLon> esata and sata are kind of obsolete standards
[14:35:44] <scara> Ohhh so it comes with a SATA cable? I don't have meany drives so I think I will have the power cable
[14:35:50] <NiLon> USB and SATA Express (SATAe) replacing them
[14:36:00] <joepie91> scara: *possibly* it may come with a SATA cable. it depends on the drive and the packaging, and it's not always stated unfortunately
[14:36:20] <joepie91> scara: where are you buying the drive from?
[14:36:29] <scara> Is that the device manufactour or the reseller that provides the cable?
[14:36:41] <scara> Buying it here (pretty good deal for 8TB) https://www.power.dk/computere-og-tablets/datakomponenter/interne-harddiske/seagate-barracuda-8-tb-35-hdd/p-1113864/
[14:37:15] <NiLon> HDD's usually don't come with cables
[14:37:21] <scara> (You might need a translator unless you read danish or similer)
[14:37:23] <joepie91> oh I thought you were in NL
[14:37:33] <scara> Whare did NL come from?
[14:37:41] <joepie91> <scara> "Eletra eSATA-kabel 2 meter"

[14:38:05] <scara> Oh... scandanavian languages are similer (except swedish)
[14:38:15] <NiLon> 2m SATA cable could be relevant if you have large case or some sort of tray that is far away from the motherboard. Mostly you would encounter this in server racks

[14:39:22] <joepie91> the 0.2m one may or may not be long enough depending on case
[14:39:35] <joepie91> for a standard desktop PC the 0.4m will probably be fine
