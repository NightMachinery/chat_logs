[00:18:01] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> neco-ghc requires the binary.
[00:18:18] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> I don't know why it is enabled.

[05:54:54] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> hi, something is happening with my vim installation and i don't get it
[05:55:16] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> i recently upgraded my debian from stretch to bullseye and then sid
[05:55:48] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> now when i launch 'vi' with my user, spacevim loads normally
[05:56:09] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> but i try to launch it with 'vim' and the next pops up:
[05:56:42] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> `vim: error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.7m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
[06:00:38] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> vim executes /usr/local/bin/vim
[06:00:51] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> vi executes /usr/bin/vi
[06:20:33] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> I can solve this by making symbolic links to other libraries but the posterior execution is riddled with library errors and a segmentation fault. Why do they behave differently?
[07:26:46] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> vi is not vim
[07:27:01] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> You should not mix them.
[07:27:27] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> And if you upgrade the OS, you need to rebuild Vim
[07:27:53] <SpaceVimBot> <Shougo> usr local bin means you have build it manually
[13:28:01] <SpaceVimBot> <calm-tedesco> @Shougo thx for the tip. vim from the debian repository didn't cut it. i had to install it from github
