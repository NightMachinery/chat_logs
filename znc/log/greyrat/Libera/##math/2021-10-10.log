[00:32:35] <cuppajoeman> Can someone explain why it becomes strict? https://i.imgur.com/9hxyjgW.png
[00:33:14] <Koen> because you took this "-1/n" margin
[00:33:32] <Koen> but actually it doesn't matter
[00:33:40] <Koen> if you make it a large inequality, it's true too
[00:34:02] <Koen> lim P(a-1/n < X <= b) = lim P(a-1/n <= X <= b)
[00:34:14] <cuppajoeman> Is it because lim n->oo (a - 1/n, b] = [a, b]?
[00:34:20] <Koen> well
[00:34:26] <Koen> yes and no
[00:34:30] <riv> mostly yes ?
[00:34:57] <Koen> "lim (a-1/n, b] = [a, b] looks intuitively true but does it even make sense?
[00:35:13] <Koen> err
[00:35:18] <Koen> I mean it makes sense
[00:35:23] <Koen> but can you even use it?
[00:35:26] <cuppajoeman> The infinite union
[00:35:29] <cuppajoeman> equals
[00:35:37] <Koen> yes, but it's hard to use it to reason about
[00:35:43] <Koen> and to compute probabilities
[00:35:48] <cuppajoeman> Hmm ok
[00:35:50] <riv> Is (A) lim n->oo (a - 1/n, b] = (a, b]
[00:35:57] <riv> or (A) lim n->oo (a - 1/n, b] = [a, b]
[00:35:57] <PlanckWalk> Infinite intersection, I think you mean.
[00:35:58] <riv> true?
[00:36:13] <riv> oops, meant to call the second (B)
[00:36:21] <cuppajoeman> PlanckWalk:  yes.
[00:36:34] <cuppajoeman> riv: idk actually
[00:36:36] <riv> lim n->oo (a - 1/n) = a
[00:36:40] <cuppajoeman> yes
[00:36:44] <cuppajoeman> Agreed
[00:36:54] <cuppajoeman> so then (a, b]
[00:36:55] <Koen> but note that lim (a - 1/n, b] is the infinite intersection, whereas lim (a+1/n, b] is the infinite union
[00:37:11] <PlanckWalk> You can define a limit of a sequence of sets in such a way that it's true
[00:37:12] <cuppajoeman> yeah it depends on whether your sets are expanding or shrinking
[00:37:22] <riv> okay, so this limit of an interval isn't a safe thing to use
[00:37:29] <cuppajoeman> yeah
[00:37:30] <riv> it's an ok idea but let's not use it
[00:37:37] <cuppajoeman> sure
[00:37:46] <cuppajoeman> How does this make sense then ? https://i.imgur.com/9hxyjgW.png
[00:37:50] <cuppajoeman> just the whole statement in general
[00:37:53] <PlanckWalk> Basically by the pointwise limit of membership functions
[00:37:56] <cuppajoeman> How did they know what to do
[00:38:06] <riv> let's think about what, rigorously, lim_{n -> inf} P(a - 1/n < X <= b) is
[00:38:19] <riv> this is actually the limit of a sequence of numbers
[00:38:23] <riv> P(a - 1/1 < X <= b)
[00:38:25] <riv> P(a - 1/2 < X <= b)
[00:38:28] <riv> P(a - 1/3 < X <= b)
[00:38:30] <riv> etc.
[00:38:33] <cuppajoeman> yes
[00:38:51] <riv> yyou were looking at CDFs earlier
[00:38:54] <PlanckWalk> That limit doesn't hold for all probabilities.
[00:38:55] <cuppajoeman> From the continuity of P, we can bring the lim inside
[00:38:55] <riv> can you use that here?
[00:39:08] <riv> I don't think you can
[00:39:18] <riv> P is not a function
[00:39:29] <riv> so you can't say that it is continuous
[00:39:48] <PlanckWalk> P is literally a function, just not a function of a topological space
[00:39:57] <riv> can you rewrite P(a - 1/n < X <= b) using CDFs?
[00:40:06] <Koen> or rather it's a function, but its domain is a set of set, so if you wanted to talk about continuity you'd need a topology on the set of sets, which is a whole lot of complexity for no reason
[00:40:07] <nejimban> PlanckWalk: it does hold for all probabilities, doesn't it?
[00:40:35] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, you can rewrite the expression in terms of an actually continuous function
[00:40:36] <nejimban> oh no
[00:41:06] <riv> cuppajoeman: is what im asking unclear?
[00:41:32] <cuppajoeman> No I'm just thinking
[00:41:38] <cuppajoeman> Trying to come up with it
[00:41:54] <riv> it's just the thing we went over earlier
[00:42:04] <PlanckWalk> Oh, my mistake.  X is a random variable, so it does hold.
[00:42:07] <cuppajoeman> F_X(b) - F_X(a - 1/n)
[00:42:11] <riv> yep
[00:42:20] <riv> so  lim_{n -> inf} F_X(b) - F_X(a - 1/n)
[00:42:28] <riv> subtraction is a continuous function
[00:42:30] <cuppajoeman> enter the limit and just get a
[00:42:34] <riv> so  F_X(b) - lim_{n -> inf} F_X(a - 1/n)
[00:42:40] <nejimban> PlanckWalk: I think one still needs left-continuity of F at a
[00:43:18] <nejimban> because they want P(a ≤ X ≤ b) (I had first read P(a < X ≤ b))
[00:43:40] <cuppajoeman> Wait so how did we get this equality: https://i.imgur.com/8QNhp4B.png

[00:44:35] <riv> cuppajoeman: that's what we are working on
[00:44:40] <riv> currently we have this: F_X(b) - lim_{n -> inf} F_X(a - 1/n)

[00:45:21] <cuppajoeman> yeah we need that
[00:45:23] <riv> we can't prove this without extra assumptions
[00:45:25] <riv> but if it were true
[00:45:46] <riv> lim_{n -> inf} F_X(b) - F_X(a - 1/n)  =  F_X(b) - F_X(a) = P(a <= X <= b)

[00:46:32] <nejimban> (left-)continuity at a means P(X = a) = 0, so P(a < X ≤  b) = P(a ≤ X ≤ b)
[00:47:05] <riv> cuppajoeman: ah maybe, I think that < and <= are interchangable here. we must have a continuous probability distribution rather than a discrete one?
[00:47:08] <PlanckWalk> You don't need any special conditions on F apart from being the cdf of the random variable, and therefore measurable and increasing.

[02:54:44] <cuppajoeman> if that's useful.
[02:56:22] <PlanckWalk> I guess the up and down arrows mean increasing or decreasing chains of sets ordered by subset
[02:56:58] <PlanckWalk> (With the RHS of the arrow referring to their union or intersection respectively)
[02:58:15] <cuppajoeman> yes.
[02:59:25] <PlanckWalk> Then it's literally just plugging in the values nejimban said.
[03:00:27] <PlanckWalk> A is the event "a <= X <= b".  A_n is the event "a - 1/n < X <= b".  {A_n} (downarrow) A.
[03:01:07] <PlanckWalk> Plug in to 1.6.1 and you get  P(A) = lim_{n->inf} P(A_n).
[03:01:28] <cuppajoeman> Wouldn't you get (a, b]
[03:01:34] <PlanckWalk> No
[03:02:03] <PlanckWalk> There is no n for which X = a is excluded from A_n

[04:01:34] <[itchyjunk]> that seems like some crazy strong property no? why is C so special like this?

[04:01:59] <[itchyjunk]> unless i am missing something

[04:32:48] <rubiksdream> im a bit unsure about the following : suppose O_n are regions of the complex plane , each containing 0, with compact closures and boundaries given by finitely many piecewise C^1 jordan curves, if O_n is increasing let g_n be such that g_n is harmonic in O_n - {0} , and is of the form -log|z| + H_n(z) for some harmonic function H_n near zero, such that H_n is harmonic in O_n with boundary values log|z| on bd(O_n), so clearly g_n
[04:32:48] <rubiksdream> vanishes on bd(O_n) -{0}, then g_n is also clearly increasing by the maximum principle, and if O_n increases to a region O, and g_n's limit is finite, we can define a harmonic function g on O. I want to prove that this g is independent of the approximating sequence O_n
[04:33:26] <rubiksdream> the issue I am running into is that I can only prove this is so if I assume each O_n has closure contained inside O, i.e. each cl(O_n) forms an exhausting sequence of compact subsets for O
[04:34:31] <rubiksdream> sorry, I mean *clearly g_n vanishes on bd(O_n)

[04:36:55] <twJizhan> QUESTION: is R "the smallest complete field" containning Q ?
[04:37:33] <rubiksdream> the way I proceed to prove g is well defined independent of the approximating sequences, with the caveat that we assume each approximating sequence has closure contained in O is as follows: Let {O_n} and {O_n'} be approximating sequences, then fixing O_n, there is some m for which O_n \subset O_m', in which case we clearly have by the maximum principle that g_n <= g_m' , by a symmetrical argument, we get for any fixed n, there is an M
[04:37:33] <rubiksdream> such that g_n <= g_m holds for all m >=m

[04:38:24] <rubiksdream> this is pretty simple, and it works, so its tempting me to just only allow such approximating sequences, so this only disallows an approximating sequence with a common boundary point to O, but maybe I can allow these and only slightly modify my argument

[07:01:28] <ThoughtPhreaker> sorry, another question on that same problem
[07:01:29] <ThoughtPhreaker> https://i.imgur.com/cZfBfsi.png
[07:02:40] <ThoughtPhreaker> it appears everything is being multiplied to the power of -1, but this doesn't seem quite correct, since v^2 is now positive
[07:05:12] <ThoughtPhreaker> well, and the former LHS is now negative
[07:05:33] <qergle> multiplied both sides by -1
[07:06:06] <ThoughtPhreaker> why would that not affect the 1 in what was the numerator, though?
[07:06:22] <qergle> if you did it to the numerator too, then you wouldn
[07:06:28] <qergle> if you did it to the numerator too, then you wouldn't be multiplying by -1
[07:06:31] <qergle> -1/-1 = 1
[07:06:46] <qergle> just like 1/3 * -1 = 1/-3, not -1/-3
[07:06:57] <ThoughtPhreaker> right
[07:07:16] <ThoughtPhreaker> but 1 - 2v - v^2 becomes v^2 + 2v - v1
[07:07:24] <ThoughtPhreaker> er, v^2 + 2v -1
[07:07:36] <qergle> yes, -1*(1-2v-v^2)=-1+2v+v^2
[07:07:49] <ThoughtPhreaker> oh, duh

[10:03:29] <Fangs> bugswriter: do you specifically want something 'far away' from CS?
[10:03:35] <Fangs> I gave you a couple of topics tangential to CS
[10:03:46] <Fangs> they're not "just CS"
[10:04:01] <bugswriter> well. I want something So I stop getting nervous when I see greek letter during my CS classes or anywhere
[10:06:50] <isekaijin> bugswriter: Both mathematics and CS are really broad disciplines, so you cannot “learn it all”. From experience, I can tell you that shallowly learning lots of randomly chosen topics ends up being a waste of time.
[10:07:48] <isekaijin> Today's world is not very friendly to “jacks of all trades”. It is better to become really good at something.
[10:09:03] <Fangs> I'd have thought someone pursuing alg geom might advocate for the polar opposite
[10:09:28] <Fangs> that everything contributes to some intuition to alg geom, that alg geom prevades everything

[10:11:23] <bugswriter> alright I think I should first look into some topics and find out what I need
[10:14:27] <Galois> why not play the natural numbers game in lean or something? It uses CS and programming skills but teaches you a ton of math.
[10:15:03] <isekaijin> I somehow hiiiiiiiiighly doubt that is the part of computer science that interests them the most.

[10:15:35] <Galois> doesn't matter. You want to get good at math? Foundations are where you start. And if you can use CS to help, so much the better.

[10:16:25] <Galois> ok, I am not a big proponent of the idea that you must learn logic and proofs before attempting logic and proofs
[10:16:40] <Galois> that's like telling a baby you have to learn English before you can speak
[10:16:52] <Fangs> a programmer probably know and, or, not, and know what a 'program' is
[10:17:16] <Fangs> I was asking if you can get away with just that in terms of logic, and a 'proof' is a 'program' in Lean that terminates
[10:17:22] <Fangs> wonder if you can get away with that
[10:17:39] <isekaijin> Lean's logic is not constructive, if I recall correctly.
[10:17:44] <isekaijin> You can freely use the axiom of choice.
[10:17:59] <Galois> that's fine? Math is not constructive
[10:18:05] <Galois> OP wants to learn math.
[10:18:32] <Fangs> I don't think programmer thinks about the constructive vs non-constructive distinction, and uses non-constructive logic too
[10:18:50] <Galois> programmers might care about the difference, but not in this context
[10:19:14] <Fangs> only a very specific sort of programmer would care I'd say
[10:19:32] <Fangs> my CS TA didn't know about this constructive logic business
[10:20:56] <isekaijin> Galois: It was not an objection to learning Lean, it was a reply to “and a 'proof' is a 'program' in Lean that terminates”.
[10:21:27] <Galois> oh ok, that's not true for a variety of reasons
[10:21:48] <Galois> proofs in a proof assistant have to provably terminate. It's not enough that they terminate.
[10:22:11] <Fangs> can you teach proof writting via Lean?
[10:22:19] <Fangs> is that something you can comfortably do?
[10:22:20] <Galois> probably. I use Coq.

[10:23:33] <Galois> the only reason I refer people to lean is because Coq doesn't have a natural numbers game

[10:24:15] <Galois> (if you turned on classical logic to Coq)
[10:24:26] <isekaijin> One thing that makes me salty about proof assistants is that they are too general-purpose (from a mathematical POV), so everything is built from the group from logical primitives.

[10:25:59] <Galois> it's not that at all
[10:26:07] <Galois> once you _prove_ something, you can use it as if it were a primitive
[10:26:15] <isekaijin> If I want to study sheaves of rings and modules, I want linear algebra to be baked into the proof assistant's logic.
[10:26:16] <Galois> there's no difference between a theorem and an axiom in terms of usage
[10:26:33] <Galois> right, so you prove a bunch of theorems about linear algebra, bam! they're in
[10:27:02] <isekaijin> You are looking at things from a purely logical point of view.
[10:27:06] <greenbagels> Galois: a possibly annoying question that I could probably find from reading stackoverflow questions or something:
[10:27:15] <Galois> ok, what am I missing?
[10:27:15] <isekaijin> But programming language design also has to take into account human factors.
[10:27:25] <isekaijin> Is the language actually comfortable to use?
[10:27:28] <Galois> I still don't know what human factor I'm missing.
[10:27:43] <Galois> judging by the amount of math in lean, yes, at least some people can use it comfortably
[10:28:13] <joel135> twJizhan: here's a line of research on real numbers https://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/analysis
[10:28:14] <greenbagels> is coq something that would be useful / interesting to learn as someone who's a math student not coming up with proofs to "hard"/"research level" problems? or would it rob me of learning useful techniques by hand
[10:28:27] <greenbagels> (for reference i don't know the extend of coq's power, all i know is that it's a "proof assistant"
[10:28:29] <greenbagels> )
[10:28:48] <Galois> the number of primitives available at the bottom level really has nothing to do with the ease of use or expressive power of the proof assistant. The whole point is that you can prove what you need and then use what you proved as if it were built in
[10:29:02] <Galois> the only cost is a one-time cost to prove what you want to use
[10:29:06] <isekaijin> joel135: That is not “research on real numbers”. That is “research on alternative foundations, using toy examples from real analysis as a showcase”.

[10:29:32] <pikapika> Galois, hi
[10:29:42] <Fangs> isekaijin: how does homological algebra relates to alg geom?
[10:29:51] <joel135> isekaijin: it identifies problems with an intuitionistic formalization of the usual epsilon-delta style definitions (dedekind cuts, cauchy sequences). it is at least not limited to intuitionism in this sense!
[10:29:56] <isekaijin> Fangs: I do not know homological algbera at all.
[10:30:08] <isekaijin> joel135: I said nothing about intuitionism.
[10:30:13] <joel135> you have before.
[10:30:14] <Fangs> presumably you'd know where they show up and why you'd have to learn about it
[10:30:30] <joel135> whether you want to denegrate all alternative foundations is up to you.
[10:30:31] <greenbagels> (I'm ok with an answer of "your question implies too little understanding of what Coq is, you can find this out reading online yourself)
[10:30:42] <Galois> I don't think Coq would ever rob you of learning useful techniques by hand. You may end up spending too much time on it and not enough time on normal math though.
[10:30:45] <isekaijin> Fangs: What I know is that I once ran into a problem that I could have solved immediately if I knew about the Koszul complex.
[10:31:12] <Galois> the thing is, to prove something in Coq, or Lean, or whatever, you really REALLY have to know how to prove it by hand.
[10:31:21] <joel135> isekaijin: at least when you criticised intuitionism i could see some substance, but now you don't seem to have as much of it
[10:31:34] <greenbagels> i see; so it's more of a thing to formalize the concept in terms of language
[10:31:40] <isekaijin> joel135: I did not criticize intuitionism, I criticized intuitionists.
[10:31:52] <greenbagels> i.e. if the Coq program is bug-free, your proof should be bug-free etc etc
[10:31:53] <pussymoneyweed> when was Coq released, 1889?

[10:49:20] <joel135> i have not used lean myself but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant) says it is based on the calculus of constructions with inductive types, which is constructive. here it is formulated as an axiom within this logic https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54764958/definition-of-choice-in-lean

[11:08:47] <isekaijin> Yes.
[11:09:10] <Galois> for many years I assumed every injective function had a left inverse. Had I been baking this into the logic, I would have been wrong.
[11:10:42] <Galois> there is literally no benefit to hard-coding results about sheaves as opposed to proving them from the ground up, other than the one-time cost of doing the proofs. It does NOTHING to make the eventual software more usable

[11:11:00] <isekaijin> Fangs: Thanks!

[14:07:53] <Gurkenglas> yep

[14:11:17] <damo22_> i think i worked out why ((-1)^k + 1) / 2 has weird properties
[14:11:19] <Gurkenglas> The mutual information between sets of variables in the output can be calculated using those determinants
[14:12:05] <Gurkenglas> And I want to know the structure of those mutual informations so I'm not quite as groping in the dark
[14:12:31] <joel135> hmm, since det(BB^T) is the volume squared of the parallelo-something formed by those rows, you may get something related to the triangle inequality
[14:13:15] <Gurkenglas> i think that's gonna get me precisely "mutual information is nonnegative"
[14:13:23] <joel135> yes
[14:15:22] <joel135> a related fact is that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement is also symmetric positive semidefinite

[17:47:27] <qergle> ok, the triangular numbers are n(n+1)/2
[17:47:35] <qergle> your numbers are n(n+1)/2 + 1
[17:47:49] <Shariff> Thanks!! That is awesome!
[17:48:05] <Shariff> So what part of math are triangular numbers, geometry?
[17:48:13] <Shariff> I do like math, and want to learn more about it :)
[17:48:16] <Z-module> just basic stuff, really
[17:48:26] <Z-module> n(n + 1)/2 = 1 + 2 +...+ n
[17:48:32] <Shariff> Z-module: I never had it in school... yet :)
[17:49:00] <Z-module> I guess you could say elementary number theory
[17:49:14] <Shariff> I'll keep my eye out for that
[17:49:28] <Shariff> Thanks for the help, y'all! :D
[17:49:41] <Z-module> it pays to also know the formulas for  1^2 +...+ n^2  and for 1^3 +...+ n^3
[17:50:51] <Shariff> Perhaps another stupid question, but why? Is that comparable to learning your tables in k12?

[17:55:07] <qergle> triangular numbers come up often, in many places. for example, when counting things. your sequence, the triangulars plus 1, are also the maximum number of pieces of cakes you get with n straight knife cuts.

[17:57:14] <anovick> Hey guys, if I have linear space V with inner product with U and W subspaces, and I have V = U direct sum with U orthogonal complement, and V = U direct sum with W, is it necessarily true that the orthogonal complement of U is W?

[20:10:54] <cherim> J is for Josephus. Now there is enough context

[20:16:23] <cherim> Is this at the end of the chapter when you know the full solution?

[20:16:45] <extern> assuming only integer are valid which make sense to our problem

[20:17:13] <cherim> Yes, it's my second most hated book

[20:17:36] <cherim> The equation is exactly as it is intended to be, J(n)=n/2
[20:17:53] <cherim> Where n=2^m + \ell
[20:18:16] <cherim> So the second line has n/2 = (2^m + \ell)/2 in the RHS
[20:18:37] <cherim> And in the LHS it has the result of moving the leading 1 in binary of 2^m+ ell to the end
[20:19:06] <cherim> Removing the leading 1 yields ell, then you shift to 2 ell, then put 1 at the end for 2ell+1
[20:19:14] <osoba> suppose i have many examples of fully deterministic functions that all look "similar" for different arguments (various colored plots in the image) and one noisy example of a function from that family (thick red line), is there any way to use the information from all other examples to denoise the function of interest?

[23:28:37] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I'm trying it on the union of two sets
[23:28:41] <riv> good idea

[23:36:20] <Galois> you should prove every entry in the table on your own

[23:42:41] <anovick> Hey guys, I have the bilnear form f(x,y) = Cov(x,y) for x,y in R^3 and I'm asked to find the dimension of U = {y in R^3 where f(x,y)=0} which is a subspace of R^3. now I know that how the Cov bilnear form representative symmetric matrix looks: M = [[n-1, -1,...,-1], [-1, n-1, -1,...,-1],...,[-1,...,-1,n-1]] but I'm not sure if U is the same subspace as the subspace of solutions to A*x=0

[23:56:15] <qergle> ok, so if i understand correctly. for vectors in R^3, you say M is [2 -1 -1;-1 2 -1;-1 -1 2]
[23:56:24] <anovick> qergle: yes
[23:57:23] <qergle> but then M*[c,c,c] is always 0, right?
[23:58:27] <anovick> well no, if M*[1,0,0] then it equals [2,-1,-1]
[23:58:51] <qergle> i meant a constant vector [c,c,c]
[23:58:59] <anovick> oh
[23:59:03] <qergle> which makes sense since it's mean differenced is [0,0,0]
[23:59:18] <anovick> true, if it's [c,c,c] then yea M*[c,c,c] = 0
[23:59:21] <pyzozord> can you guys suggest some good ontologhy of mathematics?
[23:59:34] <pyzozord> like where does "matrix" belong, or "trigonometry"
[23:59:46] <qergle> anovick: i'm still not up to speed on the definitions
[23:59:57] <qergle> say you have x=[1 2 2] and y=[3 3 4]
