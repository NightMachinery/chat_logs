[12:11:05] <bookworm> the database is the problem actually
[12:11:22] <bookworm> the text files are a fire and forget thing
[12:11:54] <bookworm> sqlite as we have it only supports a single writer

[14:19:29] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:22:13] <meena> so, I have somebody complain to me, that I'm trying to steal their nick. I have no idea how that happens. their name is "tawr" mine is "meena"
[14:22:58] <bookworm> steal?
[14:23:28] <bookworm> They can simply protect the nick and nickserv will boot you off if you try to use it
[14:23:46] <bookworm> or are you trying to auth as them to nickserv itself?
[14:23:52] <meena> the problem tho is that I don't know how my configuration could possibly even try to do that
[14:24:03] <meena>  03:27:25  -- NickServ (NickServ@services.libera.chat): meena3!~meena@static.41.178.217.95.clients.your-server.de failed to login to tawr. There have been 2 failed login attempts since your last successful login.
[14:25:02] <meena> let's first find out if that's my IP
[14:25:28] <bookworm> the only place where TL directly takes login information from is the network settings, so a right click and edit should sort you out
[14:26:25] <Activ8> you can't just steal a nick if it's protected via a login anyway
[14:26:51] <meena> i need to check my logs but that *is* my IP
