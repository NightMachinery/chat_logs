[13:46:29] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> hey all
[13:48:13] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> I have a shell open in my spacemacs ( SPC ' ) and I have run some test pipeline in in it. Now, on stderr I get some info about the file where is the failing test, what is the fastest way from the shell buffer to open that file in another window?
[13:49:11] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski>  (https://files.gitter.im/543c742ddb8155e6700cb292/hnGf/image.png)
[13:49:24] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> suppose I got to V the underlined yellow line, what do I do from there?
[14:34:11] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> @enricopolanski try `spc x o`. I'm not sure if you'll need the working directory to be synced with the terminal though, which I know I had to tweak something to make it work for vterm and I can't remember for ansi term. You might also want to take a look at compile (`spc c C`) to launch your tests and whatever the javascript layer has

[17:46:50] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> sorry another noob question
[17:46:53] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> what does it mean?
[17:46:57] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> `package 'gitignore-mode-1.1.0; is unavailable`
[17:47:15] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> I don't understand how am I supposed to fix this
[17:56:48] <FromGitter> <henriquenj> @enricopolanski I think this is a known bug because this package was moved to a different place recently. This PR seems to fix the problem, but it is not merged yet https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/15117
[18:58:49] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> How can I merge those and compile?
[19:08:54] <FromGitter> <enricopolanski> say I cloned his pr
[20:21:52] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> Hi there.  ‚èé I have a noob question. My my evil mode is behaving weirdly. I cannot exit `edit` state with ESC, C-g or anything else. While `hjkl`works for navigation. Anyone knows what is going on?
[20:24:18] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> Is it the same when you restart emacs?
[20:27:32] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> rename your .emacs.d to .emacs.d.bak and git clone <pr url> some-dir/.emacs.d
[20:28:13] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> you will have to redownload packages and might lose some stuff, so you can reference your .emacs.d.bak
[20:28:13] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> yep. I tried packages roll back, still the same
[20:28:56] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> you on dev version or stable? was it working before or this is your first time using all this?
[20:30:19] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> on dev. I've not used spacemacs for a while so I don't know when this happened
[20:30:59] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> i would just backup your .emacs.d and .spacemacs and .emacs and git clone the stable version and see if it works from there
[20:39:18] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> so this is not something I accidentally switched on?
[20:40:40] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> @simpleranchero: I misread what you wrote. edit should show in the bottom right. But -- Insert -- should show on the bottom when you want to actually type
[20:41:18] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> The bottom left should actually say what Vim mode you're in
[20:41:57] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> i, I, a, A to enter insert mode
[20:44:26] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> yes it shows edit. but when I switch to emacs style of editing, that one works OK. but when I switch to vi style something is not right
[20:44:59] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> What do you mean? Also do you know how to use vim/vi?
[20:45:12] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> `i, I, a, A` does not nothing
[20:45:31] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> I was using `vi` style of editing
[20:45:41] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> What file are you working on?
[20:45:49] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> what's your buffer?
[20:46:43] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> Try it again in *scratch* buffer
[20:46:51] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> \*scratch\*
[20:47:03] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> this happens on all of them: org, plain text, code, scratch buffer
[20:47:38] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> then i would suggest to switch from the dev version to the stable version for spacemacs, moving all the configurations and .emacs.d to a backup folder
[20:47:53] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> and finally checking \*Message\* for any errors or warnings
[20:48:05] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> the \*Messages\* buffer
[21:01:01] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> cloning `.emacs.d` on a new helped with this issue. there a bunch of others. but at least `vi` editing works. Thanks
[21:02:15] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> make sure your .spacemacs was also moved to a backup folder. you could be mixing up dev configs with stable configs
[21:02:29] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> possibly .spacemacs.env but you know all those dot files
[21:18:43] <FromGitter> <simpleranchero> yep. thanks. so far switched to `develop` without issues.
[22:45:48] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> anyone know if there is an evil keybinding for toggling hide emphasis markup in org-mode?
