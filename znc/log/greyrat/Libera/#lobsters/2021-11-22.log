[05:48:56] <enterprisey> it was more about giving feedback to other people. the first culture being compared was basically "shop floor"/"machine shop" culture
[05:49:01] <enterprisey> it might have been observed explicitly that cultures on the internet started out that way and evolved to be less blunt ("culture 2"), or that might've just been an obvious takeaway

[13:34:37] <epilys> yeah that DHTML bit was weird

[20:26:15] <MattWThomas[x]> When it came out
[20:26:31] <MattWThomas[x]> I didn't have a smartphone until I was in college
[20:26:33] <iDrougge> So perhaps you were a bit older when you got one yourself.
[20:26:41] <MattWThomas[x]> Definitely
[20:27:46] <MattWThomas[x]> My parents got me a Kindle fire because data plans were so expensive back then
[20:28:11] <banna> You think tech competency would be higher with the new generations growing up with more technology
[20:28:13] <MattWThomas[x]> So I had a wifi enabled tablet in HS
[20:28:28] <MattWThomas[x]> banna: that's what I thought too

[20:29:22] <iDrougge> The Iphone did a lot to bring down 3G data prices. Getting a smartphone before that was often not sensible because using one would be too expensive.
[20:29:23] <banna> I think that sweet spot was when tech became usable without knowing a certain level of IT-related skills
[20:30:04] <MattWThomas[x]> banna: yeah, accessible but not so media-centric

[20:31:35] <MattWThomas[x]> I think openness helps too. I learned a lot when I was younger from trying to cheat in games.
[20:31:43] <iDrougge> In a way, I sense there is a counter-reaction in the culture now. In the 90s, programming was not seen as a future skill, but rather as old 80s thinking.
[20:31:49] <MattWThomas[x]> But kids can't do that on an iPad
[20:32:06] <iDrougge> Now nerds have such power that much of their mindset is infecting common culture.
[20:32:07] <banna> That helps, there needs to be a goal that someone needs to achieve and the barriers to that goal must require some application of IT skills
[20:32:46] <MattWThomas[x]> banna: yes. I think a lot about this.
[20:33:04] <MattWThomas[x]> Giving kids too few resources can be educational.
[20:33:39] <banna> That's why I try to use an environment that makes me understand what I'm working with, and to minimize automation such that future goals are solved manually and automated by my understandings rather than a pre-packaged automation
[20:34:29] <banna> i.e. most android phones package Google Photos, Google Drive, Google *, which are all, to me, pre-packaged automation
[20:34:43] <MattWThomas[x]> I learned git only to use GitHub pages
[20:34:50] <banna> ...That's insane!
[20:35:01] <banna> Although, very interesting.
[20:35:04] <MattWThomas[x]> Which I only did because my parents wouldn't buy me hosting
[20:35:38] <banna> I guess that's one way to force yourself to learn git
[20:35:46] <MattWThomas[x]> If they got me some cpannel thing then I definitely would have used that
[20:36:42] <MattWThomas[x]> I had to convert a WordPress site too
[20:37:28] <MattWThomas[x]> But at first I just used wget -m
[20:37:42] <banna> Perhaps well-designed tech is more "use these tools, learn these tools, and then you can do what you need to do"
[20:37:46] <MattWThomas[x]> So "conversion" is overselling it
[20:37:51] <banna> "unix philosophy" and what not
[20:37:57] <MattWThomas[x]> I think that makes sense
[20:38:22] <MattWThomas[x]> The nice thing about Unix for learning too is that the tools are so modular
[20:38:46] <banna> I think it is reasonable to hold space for people not wanting to be as involved in IT as they have other things to focus on
[20:39:30] <banna> however that is an evil space where people can integrate malicious intentions in the foundation of how that can happen
[20:39:46] <banna> or, just a plain space with lots of room for oversight
[20:40:09] <MattWThomas[x]> With the Unix tools, it's very likely that a tool you use once can be used for something else
[20:40:38] <MattWThomas[x]> I think that kids should know what file paths are
[20:41:05] <iDrougge> There is nothing wrong with the unix philosophy, but Unix is hardly an implementation.
[20:41:16] <MattWThomas[x]> Not every kid should learn how to code
[20:41:47] <MattWThomas[x]> But they should have what they would need to learn it if they wanted to
[20:42:08] <iDrougge> But they should also have Photoshop and Cubase.

[21:24:03] <riv> what's the worry? could a different user cat them if they knew the path?
[21:33:30] <conartist6> Still hoping to get perms to post on the site. Site says I can do it here. Anyone know how?

[21:35:41] <conartist6> The site implies that any existing user could send me an invite...
[21:36:39] <iDrougge> indigo: Well, at least Logic is almost as old as Cubase.
[21:36:49] <indigo> I think with a nick like conartist6, it might be difficult to get an invite :-) Do you have any online presence, like a github or HN account?
[21:37:40] <conartist6> github/conartist6
[21:38:26] <riv> what do you want to post
[21:38:59] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[21:38:59] <conartist6> I'd like to share some of the things I've developed to get feedback and gauge interest
[21:39:59] <riv> ah that's not really what the site is for i think
[21:40:05] <riv> yuo can share you stuff in this IRC though
[21:41:15] <conartist6> I'd also just be curious to know generally how others go about putting the word out about things they've built
[21:41:41] <conartist6> I've been sitting quietly on a lot of work I put into https://github.com/iter-tools/iter-tools
[21:41:42] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - iter-tools/iter-tools: The iterable toolbox ] - github.com
[21:41:52] <riv> i don't know. i've got hundreds of stars frmo posting stuff to HN, but it's an extremely shallow interest
[21:42:07] <riv> nobody did much beyond star it and go read the next article
[21:42:13] <ngoldbaum> write good blog posts about it and about problems you solved building it
[21:42:44] <conartist6> Yeah that's what I plan to do but I've not quite finished solving all the problems yet
[21:42:57] <conartist6> It's slow.
