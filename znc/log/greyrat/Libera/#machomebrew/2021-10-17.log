[21:38:40] <LyndsySimon> Greetings, all. I'm using homebrew on my M1 MBP, with Alacritty as my terminal. I'm having issues dealing with the multiple architectures available. When I run `brew upgrade`, it returns the error `Error: Cannot install under Rosetta 2 in ARM default prefix (/opt/homebrew)!`
[21:38:59] <LyndsySimon> I suspect that my terminal is running under Rosetta, but don't know how to check. Can anyone help with that?
[21:48:53] <LyndsySimon> I figured it out - `arch` in Alacritty returns `i386`, which means it's running in Rosetta. `arch` in Kitty returns `arm64`, which means I'm not.
