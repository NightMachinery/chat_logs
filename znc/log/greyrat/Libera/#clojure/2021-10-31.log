[01:32:48] <selfsymmetric-mu> I was doing a programming puzzle earlier today, and I realized that I don't have a good idea of how to quickly overwrite parts of an array. I thought I'd use subvec, but that's an immutable reference. If I were in Rust I'd prefer to borrow a mutable slice at a time. What's the right way to do this sort of thing in Clojure? I ended up re-doing the representation into a fancy map representing intervals, but then I got bogged down 
[01:32:48] <selfsymmetric-mu> complexity.
[01:34:04] <selfsymmetric-mu> Perhaps (atom int-array) was the right data structure? It was of constant length.
[01:36:38] <ridcully> if you hammer on things. maybe a transient is the right thing

[01:41:16] <selfsymmetric-mu> ridcully: Exactly what I needed, thank you!
[01:44:00] <selfsymmetric-mu> I would use a transient vector, with assoc! over the ranges.

[14:37:51] <mishugana> Hello folks, eliciting responses here - CLisper seeking to learn Clojure (give it a shot) - have solid background in Java as well. There are a plethora of books, but wanted to know which book(s) did you use to learn Clojure, and/or what you would recommend today?
[14:39:01] <mishugana> If it helps, I prefer books in the vein of "The C Programming language", "Programming in Haskell" or "Programming Rust", so not necessarily example-driven or replete with details, but cohesive, flowing, and logically well-connected without collapsing under heft
[14:39:19] <Para> mishugana: https://www.braveclojure.com/ https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-the-essential-reference 
[14:39:30] <mishugana> Para: Thank you!
[14:39:51] <Para> Quite different in style, both are relatively recent, the latter is more of a reference.
[14:40:02] <Para> ...just like the name implies
[14:40:25] <Para> Also clojuredocs.org/ https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/ http://clojure-doc.org/
[14:41:04] <Para> Especially clojuredocs is fun as it has community provided examples for all Clojure API functions which makes it infinitely better than Clojure's plain docs
[14:41:32] <mishugana> Para: That tip about clojuredocs seems very useful, thanks for sharing!
[14:41:58] <Para> You can also get it as browser search provider, eg. I have on my Firefox 'clj <whatever>' that automagically jumps to clojuredocs
[14:42:37] <Para> And if you end up using Cursive, it downloads clojuredocs data export automatically and uses it for the pop-up docs.
[14:42:42] <mishugana> Para: Just one question - the webpage for Brave Clojure mentions 2016... is that okay?
[14:42:47] <Para> Yep.
[14:42:51] <mishugana> Okay, cool!
[14:43:40] <Para> That's one aspect of the Clojure ecosystem; things can become done and complete :) So just because something hasn't been updated in years doesn't mean it would be obsolete or broken or anything. 
[14:44:08] <mishugana> That's actually heartening to hear :-)
[14:44:09] <Para> there's also this that's pretty alright https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3/web-development-with-clojure-third-edition/
[14:44:24] <mishugana> That's the one by yogthos on reddit, right?
[14:44:40] <mishugana> I mean Dmitri Sotnikov
[14:44:42] <Para> Dunno, I don't follow people :)
[14:44:53] <mishugana> hahaha, cool cool... yes, will check it out!
[14:45:58] <mishugana> Thank you very much, Para - that's been very helpful. Rather than subject myself to analysis-paralysis, I think I'll go ahead with Brave Clojure and see how it goes. 
[14:46:06] <mishugana> Cheers!
[14:46:11] <Para> np
