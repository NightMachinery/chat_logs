[06:52:31] <numsima> How would I do this in bash? So I have two strings/values; first value I want to decode from hex -> encode b64 then second value leave it as hex and encode b64. 
[06:53:18] <yitz> there's a base64 command
[06:53:19] <kurahaupo> numsima: What do you mean "leave it as hex"?
[06:54:05] <numsima> kurahaupo both values start as hex

[09:34:56] <jmcantrell> would be better to use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
[09:34:58] * jmcantrell ducks
[09:37:06] * kurahaupo slaps jmcantrell with a jellyfish
[09:37:23] <jmcantrell> but why
[09:38:32] <kurahaupo> Because if you're installing the script on the machine in front of you, you already know where Bash is, and it's one fewer defects in the security perimeter
[09:38:56] <jmcantrell> eggbean: it looks like zsh does have mapfile as a module, but i don't think zsh is best for scripts. https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html
[09:39:35] <jmcantrell> kurahaupo: but if `env` is compromised, wouldn't there be bigger problems?
[09:39:46] <kurahaupo> (Security defects mostly aren't about single points of failure; rather, they're about small failings that can be combined to breach the overall security)
[09:40:21] <kurahaupo> "env" is weakened simply by putting PATH=:$PATH
[09:40:30] <eggbean> jmcantrell: oh. Well I don't really have any interest in getting used to zsh as I do cloud stuff
[09:41:01] <jmcantrell> what's "cloud stuff"?
[09:41:35] <eggbean> I work with cloud instances and they won't have zsh installed by default
[09:41:36] <jmcantrell> kurahaupo: how so?
[09:42:18] <kurahaupo> Yes if env is the last point in the penetration chain "other things have already gone wrong", but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be avoided most of the time. Defense in depth.
[09:42:26] <jmcantrell> ah, yeah, bash is definitely the way to go if you're using your scripts in other places
[09:43:50] <kurahaupo> Zsh is in many ways superior to Bash, but it fails on one extremely important point: its POSIX compliance is significantly worse.
[09:44:38] <kurahaupo> (Even though that non compliance is part is the improvements)
[09:44:45] <jmcantrell> zsh itself declares that its focus is on interactive use
[09:45:25] <jmcantrell> superior or not, bash is almost everywhere by default
[09:46:12] <pystardust> if zsh doesn't wanna be posix complaint then why bothering having similarities, why not do something like fish and come up with a cleaner syntax through out
[09:48:21] <jmcantrell> i bet #zsh would have an answer to this
[09:50:52] <jmcantrell> it is kind of nice to be able to source the same sh scripts from bash and zsh
[09:52:37] <kurahaupo> jmcantrell: For #!…env to be a significant factor in a penetration chain, the minimum scenario would involve at least 4 actors - an attacker, a victim, and two package developers. So nobody has a clear overview of the security, and the easiest fix is to refrain from using #!…env in packaged scripts. The essential problem is that the script itself cannot sanitize PATH
[09:53:34] <jmcantrell> kurahaupo: you've convinced me
[09:54:00] <jmcantrell> at least for packaged scripts, there's no reason to not be explicit
[09:54:26] <kurahaupo> (Sure it's unlikely in any given setting, but with millions of packages floating about, it's only a matter of time before someone finds a weakness.)

[15:36:11] <jmcantrell> i wonder why they thought export was necessary
[15:36:34] <grondilu> does it make sense to write `f() { local foo="${foo:-default}"; }; foo=specific f` ?

[17:19:23] <PeGaSuS> hello guys. so, I have this script that I've found in the internet to translate sentences: https://termbin.com/h517 ; the keyboard shortcut I've set is ALT+R which works great if I use the mouse or SHIFT+RIGHT/LEFT to select the word, but not if I use CTRL+A. zn
[17:19:28] <Fernando-Basso> 😲
[17:19:39] <PeGaSuS> any ideas? thanks in advance
[17:20:00] <emanuele6> Fernando-Basso: when printing a variable, use printf
[17:20:02] <euouae> PeGaSuS , there's programs you can download that do translations
[17:20:39] <emanuele6> `echo "something is $something"' is fine
[17:21:01] <emanuele6> but don't print variables you don't control on their own with echo
[17:21:04] <PeGaSuS> euouae: I know, but I need to write in a GUI and then copy back the text. this is kinda of a all-in-one
[17:21:37] <euouae> PeGaSuS , sorry, what do you need to do?
[17:22:38] <euouae> PeGaSuS ok, I see. I read the script
[17:22:49] <PeGaSuS> like I've explained above, the script works fine when selecting with mouse or ALT+RIGHT/LEFT but not with CTRL+A
[17:23:34] <euouae> PeGaSuS I think the reason it doesn't work is because CTRL+A contains newlines
[17:24:10] <PeGaSuS> newlines even if the sentence is like 4 words?
[17:25:05] <euouae> I think CTRL+A may insert a newline

[17:27:34] <euouae> PeGaSuS do you have any scripting knowledge whatsoever? i.e. do you understand how to replace the wget line with an offline translator?
[17:27:43] <PeGaSuS> this is to be used in irc. I don't want to keep switch back and forth between apps just to translate a few words
[17:27:55] <euouae> yeah but you don't have to
[17:28:01] <PeGaSuS> and no, I have 0 code knowledge
[17:28:34] <euouae> OK I'm not going to do it for you because I am about to quit 
[17:29:06] <euouae> but basically I believe the issue is that you're copying newlines. You can verify this if you'd like by using the mouse and trying to translate a newline.
[17:29:45] <PeGaSuS> if selected by the mouse it works with newlines
[17:29:55] <PeGaSuS> just not with CTRL+A
[17:30:09] <euouae> I doubt it, it would be a way to tell
[17:30:13] <euouae> if I'm right
[17:30:48] <euouae> try replacing the second line from  `text="$(xsel -o)"` to `text="$(xsel -o | tr '\n' ' ')"`
[17:32:07] <Fernando-Basso> emanuele6: Thanks for all the examples!
[17:33:25] <PeGaSuS> euouae: it works when using the mouse but not CTRL+A still.. it just copies tr '\n' ' '

[20:38:39] <cornfeedhobo> FreeBDSM: you can overload any built-in, yes. is it a good idea is subjective and most people will probably tell you "no, it's not a good idea"

[22:24:55] <mithrin> Hi - what linux tool can I use to decypher simple cryptographic function? I.e. all chars on line are moved n-positions?
[22:25:09] <eggbean> I'll figure it out eventually. For now I am just going to live without bash compleition for this thing
[22:25:13] <mithrin> all 'x'es for example or all numbers
[22:25:33] <jmcantrell> That would drive me nuts :)
