[00:00:04] <signofzeta> If you're using some kind of volume license (MAK, KMS) then there's nothing to worry about.
[00:00:08] <signofzeta> Of course, that's all honor system.
[00:03:45] <PublicWiFi> in my case this host only handles email shit
[00:03:59] <PublicWiFi> so its exchange + email sec + a couple linux boxes
[00:04:24] <PublicWiFi> so I found a license in my vmware pile.. "VMware vSphere Hypervisor" for 2 CPU
[00:04:41] <PublicWiFi> no idea wtf this was for, we have an essensials license
[00:05:03] <PublicWiFi> bah im not a esxi guy at all xD
[00:05:11] <PublicWiFi> i think licensing is my least favorite thing about IT work
[00:10:57] <signofzeta> It's enough to make you spin up a Linux VM with Postfix, Dovecot, SpamAssassin, policyd-spf, dkimpy-milter, OpenDMARC, fail2ban... did I miss anything? :-P

[00:26:47] <signofzeta> Hybrid Exchange sucks, but it's the only supported way to use Azure AD Connect.  (though I don't do that, either)
[00:31:44] <PublicWiFi> supported way to do Azure connect?
[00:31:46] <PublicWiFi> only*
[00:31:59] <PublicWiFi> you mean move it all to o365 and then have the exchange on prem still to do the aad connect?
[00:35:27] <signofzeta> if you're using AADC to sync AD->AAD, then the only supported way to edit some Exchange attributes is through Exchange.

[16:09:49] <BWMerlin> CptLuxx: what are your thoughts about the crypto miner situation with tactical?
[16:11:38] <CptLuxx> ?
[16:11:54] <CptLuxx> one idiot found the private agent from the developer.. 
[16:12:02] <CptLuxx> ok his private agent includes a miner 
[16:12:03] <CptLuxx> ok
[16:12:12] <CptLuxx> who cares as long as the normal agent doesnt have it
[16:12:47] <BWMerlin> I think it was bad coding hygiene (if that is even a thing)
[16:13:48] <BWMerlin> Even now I still don't know why you would include the miner in a private build vs having the RMM install it as isn't that the whole point of having a RMM (amongst other things)
[16:14:07] <CptLuxx> he said that
[16:14:19] <CptLuxx> *he explained it 
[16:14:49] <BWMerlin> Not really, just said that it was for his own personal machines, fine but once again, why even included it vs have the agent install it?
[16:14:56] <BWMerlin> I still cannot understand that part
[16:15:00] <nobyk> What's going on
[16:15:13] <CptLuxx> ????
[16:15:17] <CptLuxx> he explained it in depth
[16:15:24] <BWMerlin> An open source RMM (Tactical RMM) was found to have a miner in a private build
[16:15:29] <CptLuxx> he loved his new feature to include stuff directly
[16:15:34] <CptLuxx> and went with it for his private agent
[16:15:38] <CptLuxx> whats the problem with that?
[16:15:50] <BWMerlin> That private build was also also hosted in the same repo as the public builds
[16:16:41] <BWMerlin> I don't think anything wrong was done but as I said, I think it was bad hygiene
[16:16:57] <BWMerlin> Making the agent open source as some people are crying out to do won't solve anything
[16:17:21] <CptLuxx> He fixed it already
[16:17:29] <BWMerlin> If they are demanding that the agent be open sourced over this (and remember, nothing was compromised or installed onto anyone
[16:17:30] <CptLuxx> You can't get the agent with money y anymore
[16:17:39] <BWMerlin> anyone's machine)

[16:18:13] <BWMerlin> Then when solarwinds was done over those same people should be demanding that solarwinds be fully open sourced so it can be vetted
[16:20:05] <BWMerlin> I view it as a hygiene issue, the dev should of kept their projects more separate 
[16:20:17] <nobyk> I guess that's fair
[16:20:57] <BWMerlin> The cries for open source (which there was apparently always a plan for) and that this project should never be touched by anyone ever I think is unfair
[16:21:33] <BWMerlin> If that is the case then when ANY RMM or other software has issues (say log4j) you should also never use it

[20:42:01] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[20:42:01] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[20:42:01] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All the so-calle
[20:42:06] <cryptic1> d “Linux” distributions are really distributions of Log Forge/Linux

[21:25:23] <hbjy> Does anyone have any experience doing multi-cloud SSO with Linux servers?
[21:26:04] <hbjy> Because of terrible architecture, we have about 40 Linux servers across a few different on-prem and cloud environments, and we wanna implement global SSO on all of them
[21:27:41] <signofzeta> not sure about that one.  Is there a PAM module for Azure AD (or whatever your most popular auth mechanism is)?
[21:27:53] <signofzeta> Short of that, setting up your own SSH CA might be your best bet, if you can handle the overhead

[21:47:04] <Sousapro> Oh Azure AD
[21:47:33] <Sousapro> So I can't believe it's not AD™ is not behaving like AD 
[21:48:10] <Sousapro> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/join-rhel-linux-vm
[21:48:52] <hbjy> Well, that bit requires the VM to be on the same VNet at AADDS
[21:48:54] <hbjy> as*
[21:48:57] <Sousapro> That should get you connected to AAD DS
[21:49:03] <hbjy> All our VMs aren't in Azure
[21:50:24] <Sousapro> So you want to connect your VMs to azure AD DS without a connection to Azure AD DS?
[21:51:57] <Sousapro> Do you have regular AD services available on your subnet?
[21:52:34] <Sousapro> Or can you drop a domain controller VM after connecting the subnet to AD via IPSec tunnel?
[21:52:41] <hbjy> Sousapro: Nope. So Tl;dr -- we have on-prem deployments at multiple sites, only one of which has our proper Active Directory setup. It also has an IPA setup which authenticates all the servers.
[21:52:55] <hbjy> Those other sites are all annoying to deal with creds for, so we want to migrate to central auth
[21:53:09] <hbjy> Originally, the plan was to use IPA and VPN gateways on each network to connect it all up
[21:53:19] <hbjy> But that didn't work because we had no luck properly getting IPs to route
[21:53:45] <Sousapro> That's definitely the right way to do this
[21:53:52] <int0x1C8> ok I migrated my mailbox 2010 -> 2016 and activesync started working again
[21:54:01] <Sousapro> Do you have conflicting subnets?
[21:54:05] <int0x1C8> but now outlook can't connect
[21:54:15] <hbjy> Nope. For the sake of argument, let's say we have 3
[21:54:20] <hbjy> 10.100.0.0/24 - Site 1
[21:54:26] <hbjy> 10.100.1.0/24 - Site 2 (AD & IPA)
[21:54:28] <Sousapro> int0x1C8: what does the Microsoft connectivity tool say?
[21:54:28] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[21:54:30] <layer8> Sousapro meant: "int0x1C8: what dose the Microsoft connectivity tool say?"
[21:54:30] <hbjy> 10.100.2.0/24 - Site 3
[21:54:53] <int0x1C8> what's that, is it built in?
[21:54:58] <hbjy> Site 1 and 3 need to be able to access IPA on Site 2
[21:55:26] <hbjy> But if I send a request from 10.100.0.5 through the VPN gateway on 10.100.0.2, 10.100.1.2 is the IP address IPA sees, not 10.100.0.5.
[21:55:44] <Sousapro> int0x1C8: testconnectivity.microsoft.com
[21:55:46] <hbjy> That's important because IPA is obviously Kerberos and DNS-centric, so it can't distinguish the devices
[21:56:25] <int0x1C8> but that's from outside, we don't do that
[21:56:46] <Sousapro> int0x1C8: your email server is inaccessible from the internet?
[21:56:53] <int0x1C8> only owa
[21:57:39] <int0x1C8> and owa is giving everyone 403 forbidden since I redirected all the urls
[21:58:09] <Sousapro> Sounds like you missed a step in exchange PowerShell during the migration
[21:58:34] <Sousapro> Sorry it's been a while since I've done 2010 to 2016
[21:58:59] <int0x1C8> I followed a guide to do it
[21:59:14] <int0x1C8> https://msexperttalk.com/exchange-2010-to-exchange-2016-migration-part-1/
[22:01:43] <Sousapro> hbjy: what are you using for IPA
[22:02:04] <Sousapro> Are we talking something like FreeIPA?
[22:02:06] <hbjy> Sousapro: [FreeIPA](https://freeipa.org)
[22:02:15] <hbjy> Yeah, FreeIPA, exactly
[22:02:21] <hbjy> Running on 2 Rocky Linux servers
[22:02:55] <Sousapro> If you use SSSD, you'll be connecting directly to the domain controller and bypassing that
[22:03:06] <Sousapro> So that should be fine
[22:03:36] <Sousapro> IP address should be reported by the host but worst case you can static IP them in AD DNS
[22:03:36] <int0x1C8> deleted outlook profile, creating new one
[22:03:43] <Sousapro> Good idea
[22:03:44] <int0x1C8> autodiscover works fine, but then says can't resolve name
[22:03:50] <hbjy> Sousapro: The problem with IPA isn't in how I'm connecting
[22:03:57] <Sousapro> Check DNS
[22:03:58] <hbjy> The problem is in the VPNs
[22:04:30] <Sousapro> I've run a large multi-site domain with both Linux and Windows hosts without having any issues
[22:04:37] <hbjy> Because if I start at 10.100.0.5, go to the VPN gateway at 10.100.0.2, then to Site 2's gateway at 10.100.1.2, then finally to IPA at 10.100.1.11, IPA thinks I connected from 10.100.1.11
[22:04:42] <hbjy> 10.100.1.2*
[22:04:50] <Sousapro> Why do you need IPA?
[22:04:58] <Jaelae> i need an IPA right now
[22:04:59] <hbjy> Medium fleet of RHEL-based VMs
[22:05:15] <hbjy> IPA is something most people on the team have figured out from our on-prem deployment
[22:05:20] <Sousapro> What is it giving you that a direct connection to MS AD won't?
[22:05:25] <hbjy> It's hooked up to local AD for passthrough on some users
[22:05:43] <hbjy> Sousapro: Sudo rules and HBAC
[22:05:52] <Sousapro> Ah
[22:06:09] <hbjy> Managing that with host groups is a lot easier than deploying multiple sudoers changes & SSH login restrictions
[22:06:30] <Sousapro>  Drop an IPA VM at your remote sites and cluster them
[22:06:53] <hbjy> Sousapro: Just connect the IPA servers themselves with a VPN and ignore the other hosts?
[22:07:14] <hbjy> That's... not _ideal_ but I guess it could work?
[22:07:17] <Sousapro> You can leave it open in case you need other hosts to communicate
[22:07:25] <hbjy> There are a few workloads we'd also like to share, as we're back on the VPN subject
[22:07:31] <Sousapro> Upside is that connectivity outages don't cripple your remote sites
[22:07:33] <hbjy> We have a local OpenSearch cluster which we throw logs at
[22:07:41] <hbjy> Sousapro: That's true actually
[22:08:28] <Sousapro> Also leaves you a valid IP for IPA if your primary site drops that everything can get to
[22:08:46] <Sousapro> I've only played with FreeIPA clustering in a lab but it wasn't terribly hard to get working
[22:08:48] <hbjy> ...when you haven't run an update on your fedora workstation for a couple weeks and it's now a 1.1gb update...
[22:08:56] <Sousapro> Oof
[22:09:03] <hbjy> Sousapro: If you set it up right it's basically drag-and-drop in the interface, too lol
[22:09:17] <Sousapro> Nice
[22:09:17] <hbjy> We've got our two IPA servers at Site 2 working clustered
[22:09:22] <Sousapro> It's been a couple of years
[22:09:29] <hbjy> Fair enough
[22:09:32] <Sousapro> Yeah if you're already clustered, just add a third
[22:09:35] <Sousapro> And fourth
[22:09:55] <hbjy> Would we then use the IPA servers _as_ VPN gateways if we needed, say, access to other local resources from the remote sites?
[22:10:25] <hbjy> It's probably something we can work with atm to just have the IPA servers cross-environment, but if we end up doing VPN stuff again it'd be a good chance to try again
[22:10:28] <Sousapro> I'd just do it at a network hardware level
[22:10:32] <Sousapro> If you can
[22:10:38] <Sousapro> Do the whole subnet
[22:10:45] <hbjy> If some of those 'sites' are actually client's cloud providers, no can do sadly
[22:11:00] <hbjy> That's why we were trying to make a VPN gateway setup work
[22:11:15] <Sousapro> The whole subnet can be only identity servers and an ssh bastion host
[22:11:35] <Sousapro> Let it route internally in their cloud or whatever
[22:11:58] <Sousapro> Run the VPN attached to the subnet you're managing
[22:12:13] <Sousapro> Every cloud provider has easy IPSec gateways
[22:12:29] <hbjy> Sousapro: Except the smaller ones, heheh
[22:12:38] <Sousapro> Who? lol
[22:12:43] <hbjy> The DigitalOceans and Linodes of the world
[22:12:54] <Sousapro> They've gotta have something lol
[22:13:04] <hbjy> https://i.imgur.com/Ja5N5Cy.png This is the _sort_ of architecture I'm working with
[22:13:08] <Sousapro> Worst case you strongswan something together
[22:13:11] <fritzwastaken> I could go for a nap
[22:13:24] <hbjy> Let's say web01 needs to access db01 (see diagram), that's something we'd _like_ to facilitate
[22:13:32] <hbjy> Which is why we wanted to try the VPN gateway route
[22:13:43] <hbjy> And enter our IP masquerading issue
[22:13:52] <Sousapro> Absolutely do an IPSec VPN gateway
[22:14:06] <Sousapro> Get around the issue by having an IPA host in both subnets
[22:14:24] <hbjy> So libreswan on a VM at each 'site', and then tell all the VMs to route shit through them
[22:14:34] <hbjy> That brings me back to the whole IP-translation issue
[22:14:40] <Sousapro> If you can't do it on their router 
[22:14:48] <Sousapro> Or through a gateway service
[22:14:48] <int0x1C8> ok I had to go into advanced settings and enable exchange proxy settings with basic auth
[22:15:02] <hbjy> Like I said, if I start at 10.100.0.5, and I request to 10.100.1.11, 10.100.1.11 thinks it came from the gateway, not the origin
[22:15:22] <hbjy> Which then still gives us the issue with IPA
[22:15:25] <Sousapro> Unless you're doing it for the whole subnet
[22:15:32] <hbjy> Which we were trying to do
[22:15:33] <Sousapro> At the router level
[22:15:35] <hbjy> Well
[22:15:41] <Sousapro> Doing it on a VM is rip
[22:15:42] <hbjy> Router-level is impossible in the cloud environments
[22:15:53] <int0x1C8> and now outlook works
[22:15:58] <hbjy> We were using VMs as faux-routers for VPN traffic only
[22:16:00] * Sousapro looks at AWS and azure and then back at hbjy
[22:16:16] <int0x1C8> but the server name it filled in is some {guid}@brucecompany.com wtf does that mean
[22:16:24] * hbjy looks at the PRICING for AWS and Azure compared to what we pay with current providers and then back at Sousapro
[22:16:41] <Sousapro> You understand why this is broken right?
[22:16:46] <hbjy> $20/mo. for 2c4g/50gb disk
[22:16:59] <Sousapro> Your VPN gateway needs to be external to the subnet
[22:17:08] <Sousapro> Routed traffic to it
[22:17:12] <hbjy> Sousapro: Yeah, but if we have two
[22:17:12] <Sousapro> Or it gets weird
[22:17:14] <hbjy> One on each site
[22:17:26] <hbjy> And our local VMs route traffic to the other subnet through those
[22:17:32] <hbjy> We have our issue
[22:18:25] <hbjy> :')
[22:18:34] <Sousapro> Yup
[22:18:35] <Jaelae> i started at my current job back in january 2019 and had a meeting to review our AWS costs 
[22:18:36] <hbjy> Having a working lab environment for this shit would be helpful
[22:18:37] <hbjy> But
[22:18:39] <hbjy> Yeah
[22:18:39] <Jaelae> and it was $27million per month
[22:18:39] <Sousapro> That's working as engineered
[22:18:41] <Jaelae> :|
[22:18:45] <Sousapro> Unfortunately
[22:19:02] <Jaelae> im curious what its like now
[22:19:03] <hbjy> We're a Microsoft partner so it'd likely be Azure
[22:19:05] <hbjy> But like
[22:19:08] <hbjy> Oof, on the pricing
[22:19:25] <Sousapro> You're paying for Enterprise features
[22:19:36] <Sousapro> Okay terrible idea
[22:19:47] <Sousapro> Wireguard all of the remote hosts
[22:20:11] <Sousapro> That will probably mess up IPA
[22:20:13] <Sousapro> Never mind
[22:20:17] <Sousapro> I give up.
[22:20:28] <Sousapro> You need a real site to site VPN
[22:20:35] <Sousapro> It doesn't matter which provider you use
[22:20:45] <Sousapro> Otherwise it's just fubar
[22:20:53] <Sousapro> Anyone else have any ideas?
[22:21:26] <hbjy> I think IPsec is the right idea
[22:21:37] <hbjy> Our on-prem site has a Sophos firewall with built-in site-to-site IPsec
[22:21:52] <hbjy> It's just a case of how to connect the other sites transparently
[22:21:56] <hbjy> i.e. without masquerading IPs
[22:22:33] <hbjy> If we moved from DO to Azure, we'd pretty much double our costs
[22:22:35] <hbjy> No bueno
[22:23:26] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:24:24] <Sousapro> Yeah they just don't offer the level of functionality required
[22:24:33] <hbjy> Who, DO?
[22:24:36] <Sousapro> Everyone is desperately posting on attempts to make it work
[22:24:39] <Sousapro> Yeah DO
[22:24:57] <Sousapro> They either use OpenVPN clients everywhere which is gross
[22:25:49] <Sousapro> Or you'll have to try to set up strongswan/OpenVPN/wireguard in gateway mode and try to deal with the issues
[22:26:09] <hbjy> Yeah
[22:26:17] <hbjy> Like having to set up static routes on every damn VM
[22:26:22] <Sousapro> Yeah
[22:27:21] <hbjy> Well
[22:27:22] <hbjy> Shit
[22:27:30] <hbjy> Time to learn Libreswan I guess
[22:28:02] <hbjy> We _were_ using Wireguard but it was just so fucking finnicky to get right
[22:28:15] <Sousapro> It's really fast though
[22:28:34] <hbjy> I guess so.
[22:28:45] <signofzeta> UDP VPN's are fast, unlike the popular SSL VPNs that encapsulate TCP inside TCP for double checksumming.
[22:28:51] <hbjy> Our Sophos FW when it went in basically said "Hey someone's spoofing traffic" and just fucking broke the tunnel
[22:29:04] <Sousapro> I can max out the network on anything with kernel mode wireguard
[22:29:10] <hbjy> Yeah
[22:29:16] <signofzeta> Masquerading IPs sucks.  I had to do NAT444 over an IPsec VPN because one client and one vendor happened to use the same damn subnet and neither side could change.
[22:29:27] <hbjy> Oooof
[22:29:27] <signofzeta> Fortunately, the vendor set it up the first time and I just copied settings.
[22:29:53] <hbjy> Maybe I'll keep trying with Wireguard, but it's like somewhere in the VPN chain, IPs aren't being forwarded properly
[22:30:07] <Sousapro> hbjy: make sure to set up whatever you use as a gateway and try routed / site to site
[22:30:13] <hbjy> Like I said, it gets so far then the endpoint sees one of the VPN servers instead of the actual origin
[22:30:39] <signofzeta> You know what?  I've had customers with Comcast say that their L2TP and/or IPsec VPNs randomly break or stop forwarding traffic.  It happens for a few weeks and then stops.
[22:30:40] <Sousapro> Are you doing point to site VPN
[22:30:46] <Sousapro> That sounds like point to site
[22:30:49] <signofzeta> Do you have Advanced Protection or whatever crap turned on in your modem?
[22:30:49] <hbjy> Site-to-site
[22:30:56] <hbjy> But it's not _working_ as a site-to-site
[22:30:58] <hbjy> For whatever reason
[22:31:05] <Sousapro> Configuration probably
[22:31:06] <signofzeta> Sorry, yes hbjy and Sousapro, I'm talking about client-to-site.
[22:31:08] <hbjy> I might nuke the VPN hosts at both sites and try again
[22:31:16] <Sousapro> Good idea
[22:31:23] <hbjy> Advanced Protection?
[22:31:32] <Sousapro> Twice the latex
[22:31:40] <hbjy> (lol I just realised I can probably just spin up a $5/mo. VM on DO as our VPN host)
[22:31:59] <Sousapro> hbjy: probably if they're on the same subnet
[22:31:59] *** Quits: CitraBenzoet (~CitraBenz@user/citrabenzoet) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:32:07] <hbjy> Terraform go brrrr
[22:32:16] <signofzeta> It's some Comcast crap built into their new modems.  I don't know what the hell it does, but some of my co-workers say turning it off makes L2TP/IPsec VPNs work better.
[22:32:25] <hbjy> Ah, right
[22:32:26] <signofzeta> But that's client-to-site, not site-to-site.
[22:32:32] <hbjy> Idk, it's this weird Sophos firewall
[22:32:49] <hbjy> It's got a ton of features, way better than what we had, but the setting to allow trusted IP spoofs is just... nonexistent lol
[22:32:55] <signofzeta> Is it doing any kind of traffic inspection or VPN ALG stuff?
[22:33:31] <Sousapro> hbjy: it kind of makes sense that they don't want weird IP spoofs
[22:33:41] <Sousapro> It's a firewall lol
[22:34:28] <hbjy> signofzeta: Possibly? I'll have to speak to the network guy again
[22:34:49] <hbjy> Sousapro: Yeah, I know, but the traffic originates on a low IP in its subnet, it should be able to tell from the MAC, idk
[22:35:11] <Sousapro>  Sounds like something was weird with the config somewhere
[22:35:15] <signofzeta> and sometimes firewalls get too smart for their own good.  but heck, even my old Linksys WRT54G had PPTP/L2TP/GRE passthrough options.
[22:35:54] <hbjy> https://rpa.st/XMJA pog
[22:38:50] <Sousapro> Yeah everyone just suggests giving the droplet a public IP and doing VPN gateway / site to site
[22:39:11] <Sousapro> Sorry, there just doesn't seem to be any good documentation anywhere
[22:39:41] <Sousapro> DO doesn't want it and so folks go elsewhere or else homelab it and don't seem to post details very often
