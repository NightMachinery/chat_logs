[00:08:34] <TinoDidriksen> Hm, UNION really doesn't guarantee returned order, only that it removes duplicates. Oh dear. Whelp, Hyrum's Law holds.
[00:08:37] <TML> well, it's not really "built-in" to pgsql, either - but it's at least part of the -contrib module that ships with the database source :)
[00:09:35] <TML> TinoDidriksen: In PgSQL, at least, it doesn't even come close to Hyrum's Law - I tried your little "union" trick, the results were all over the place :)
[00:10:00] <TinoDidriksen> Yeah, I just looked through the documentation for the big engines, and none of them guarantee anything.

[00:10:51] <TML> You could fake it using a constant value and an ORDER BY
[00:12:46] <TinoDidriksen> Levenshtein is not applicable in my abuse case. I know the inputs are strict substrings, because the spell check is done beforehand with a much faster finite state method.
[00:13:35] <TML> well, Levenshtein would tell you the number of edits, which should give you a rough ordering - the "closer" it matches, the better
[00:13:38] <TML> :shrug:
[00:13:49] <TML> with cte_union as (select …, 1 as strength union select …, 2 as strength union select …, 3 as strength) select * from cte_union order by strength;
[00:14:50] <TML> though I suppose that'd drop your unqiueness side-effect
[00:15:24] <TML> (because, at the very least, the exact string will match both the suffix wildcard and the prefix wildcard at different strengths)
[00:17:06] <TML> So it'd be more like: with cte_union as (select …, 1 as strength union select …, 2 as strength union select …, 3 as strength) select …, min(strenght) from cte_union group by … order by min(strength);
[00:17:14] <TinoDidriksen> Hm, I can't actually find the union code atm to see what exactly I did and why. In another similar project I used multiple separate queries, because I also needed several Unicode transformations and special indexes for them.
[00:17:45] <TML> feels like a pretty long way around, though
[00:18:32] <TML> also, imagine that I spelled strength correctly each time ;)
[00:21:18] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, that particular union code may have been retired because I switched a whole backend out with a native corpus query engine. Consigned to history.

[01:23:02] <on3pk> hm
[01:23:24] <on3pk> I guess thinking it through trying to explain the problem I was able to convince myself it isn't a huge problem
[01:23:44] <Albright> I'm still not sure what the problem is myself. :P
[01:25:51] <on3pk> Suppose the truth server publishes the periodic update saying an event occurred 15 times.  Simultaneously a node records an event occurring for a 16th time.  When the node receives the periodic update it will revert back to believing the event only occurred 15 times.  However, when the truth server receives the event message it will believe the
[01:25:52] <on3pk> event occurred 16 times
[01:27:26] <on3pk> So in a very specific instance there could be an inconsistency.  But because truth server still records the event occurring for a 16th time, eventually the system will become consistent

[01:34:29] <on3pk> the value would be stored locally as a cache for speed's sake

[01:36:05] <on3pk> The speed problem may be related the the raspberry pis
[01:36:25] <Albright> I don't know if MQTT is capable of doing pushes/notifications of updates, but if so I guess you could use that to invalidate the cache.
[01:36:42] <Albright> But if not, then you're going to have this problem whenever a cache is involved, yes.
[01:37:58] <on3pk> I don't know all the features of MQTT, but I'm using it because it can act as a pub/sub server
[01:38:16] <on3pk> I'm using the mosquito mqtt
[01:42:24] <on3pk> presumably I could have each node subscribe to a control topic so the truth server can tell a node to refresh cache
[01:44:51] <Albright> Sounds good to me
[01:45:19] <Albright> Or if it sends the new value with the notification, you could update the cache directly.

[07:02:12] <Blondie101010> you're confusing things...  the permission or role is checked where it's needed, not where you call it

[07:03:12] <Rockwood> oops
[07:04:26] <Rockwood> suppose moderator and admin can block a user and disable for any action in to forums or for the posts
[07:04:41] <Rockwood> admin can block any

[07:11:54] <Blondie101010> that looks appropriate
[07:11:54] <deltab> you can do it in the controller, but you might find that you don't want to write code to check permissions in every controller
[07:12:18] <deltab> so then you would use middleware to check permissions before calling the controller
[07:12:34] <Blondie101010> sometimes you have to not follow some lame MVC
[07:12:57] <Rockwood> what is the meaning of lame?
[07:13:09] <Blondie101010> average, boring
[07:13:10] <Rockwood> means rules
[07:13:13] <Rockwood> ok

[08:23:50] <Blondie101010> the JS client sends the back-end an auth request, and if it succeeds, the back-end sends it the layout
[08:24:52] <Blondie101010> I'd make that optional in the API call
[08:25:07] <Blondie101010> hmmmm but maybe not
[08:28:10] <deltab> if it's a small difference in the interface, I'd use something like  {% if user.canBan %} <button id="ban-button">Ban</button> {% endif %}
[08:28:45] <deltab> for a large difference I'd make separate templates

[10:57:16] <arash> Hello, is if($json_data['type']) equal to if(isset($json_data['type'])) ?
[11:02:43] <arash> I mean can I remove isset in order to make it cleaner code?
[11:02:53] <TinoDidriksen> No
[11:04:04] <TinoDidriksen> isset() checks that it is !== null. Simply checking the value also checks against 0 and empty string and anything else false'y.
[11:05:05] <arash> I just want to check if it exist.
[11:05:13] <TinoDidriksen> Then you want array_key_exists()
[11:06:38] <TinoDidriksen> If it doesn't exist, trying to read it will raise a warning. You must use a function or construct to check.
[11:08:05] <TinoDidriksen> Also, semantics matter. If you truly want to check existence, then you should use array_key_exists() because that is the correct semantic way to do that.
[11:08:30] <TinoDidriksen> empty() and isset() can sort of do it, but it's not quite right.
[11:09:28] <TML> arash: Note that "cleaner" !== "fewer characters" - in this case, it's _cleaner_ to take the few extra characters to clearly express the intent
[11:10:21] <arash> thank you.

[11:44:46] <TML> occasionally asked, rarely answered
[11:46:22] <TML> [twisti]: I don't know composer at all, but one idea that comes to mind is that you could fork the projects in question, indicate that they're now "supported" for your purposes, and depend on the forks instead of the unmaintained upstream

[20:14:43] <__adrian> http 403 means "forbidden" - you're logged in, but you're not allowed to see that page. I'd guess you're logged in as a regular user, and you need to log in as an admin to see that page.
[20:15:08] <__adrian> for laravel-specific questions/resources, there is  https://laravel.io/

[21:13:01] <Hash> Right?
[21:13:15] <Hash> But with conditional return, you can  juse return if something or return something if something else.

[21:17:07] <Rockwood> now you are throwing mix question now :D
[21:17:21] <relipse> Hash: i already found that and tried it and it didn't work
[21:17:34] <Hash> Try #httpd or #apache or whatever it was.
[21:17:49] <Hash> I don't deal with rewrite module or etc. I use nginx which is more to my taste.

[21:18:14] <Rockwood> ??
[21:18:20] <Hash> I don't follow Rockwood
[21:18:21] <__adrian> i'm not sure what you mean by "return ternary" - a ternary would produce a value, and that would be returned.
[21:18:37] <Hash> I mean, write it as a normal condition, or a ternary. Either.
[21:18:39] <__adrian> also not sure what benefit/drawback you're imagining
[21:18:47] <Hash> Both are conditionals. So I was wondering what actual value this brings.
[21:19:01] <Hash> Seems like it maybe useful, but Ralph did say it's been a hard sell all year
[21:19:04] <__adrian> a ternary has a condition, but is not a conditional statement
[21:19:08] <Rockwood> JS is not good for logics :D
[21:19:17] <__adrian> and you can already   return  $x ? $y : $z

[23:23:20] <__adrian> note 600ms is not exactly "snappy" either, though.
[23:23:24] <Dr-007> yeah, thats what i figured. index overviews are probably cachable but search and stuff wont
[23:23:36] <Dr-007> true, but it still uses the database on the pi
[23:23:43] <Dr-007> which makes it 'ok'
[23:23:47] <__adrian> depends on how you do search. it should at least be indexable
[23:24:18] <Dr-007> do you think the symfony api would be faster?
[23:24:37] <__adrian> there's no reason to think that
[23:24:38] <Dr-007> i think its slow on the pi because all of the files that get included
[23:24:50] <Dr-007> and the read / write isnt that fast
[23:24:53] <__adrian> the problem is more like to do with how your business logic goes
[23:24:56] <noord> Dr-007: rpis are good at electronics prototyping, not running web applications
[23:25:04] <__adrian> ^ and the pi, yes
[23:25:34] <Dr-007> yes i know. ive got one running my zwave stuff and i added nginx + my lightweight selfbuild site to control lamps and stuff
[23:25:35] <__adrian> but if there's something to improve with the app itself, then it's going to be the business logic, not the framework.
[23:25:45] <__adrian> get a nuc
[23:26:06] <Dr-007> but im trying to switch to laravel and vuejs so i can access it from the web
[23:26:17] <Dr-007> a nuc?
[23:26:23] <Dr-007> its something like a pi?
[23:26:35] <__adrian> no (aside from being small)
[23:26:53] <Dr-007> ah, i googled it
[23:27:15] <Dr-007> it has to be the pi because the io pins are connected to the zwave radio controller
[23:27:31] <Dr-007> well, ive got something to think about
[23:27:58] <__adrian> did you make your own, or something? i've not seen zwave transcievers that weren't usb sticks
[23:29:05] <Dr-007> my selfbuild site on the pi has a load time of load: 407 ms
[23:29:06] <__adrian> but if you need to keep the pi for that, then make it a service, and run your websites on something a bit more capable
[23:29:37] <Dr-007> fyi
[23:29:45] <Dr-007> no i didnt build my own
[23:29:56] <Dr-007> let me have a looksy whats attached on it
[23:30:04] <Dr-007> ive got it for 8 years now

[23:35:32] <Dr-007> whats an aib?

[23:36:41] <__adrian> like i said, you could leave the Rpi in charge of the low-level stuff, and run your websites on a {nuc or something}
[23:36:52] <__adrian> they'd just send commands to the pi
[23:37:01] <Dr-007> ah, ok. yeah ive finally build something for it after all these years. also found some python that gets triggered inmediately upon radio signals. so ill be adding that
[23:37:18] <noord> Dr-007: you maybe consider redesigning your system
[23:37:31] <Dr-007> yeah, thats what ive got right now. the pi is merely there so i can turn on the server on a distance
[23:37:37] <TML> Dr-007: Is this something that needs to live inside your edge/firewall?
[23:37:37] <Dr-007> and my lights
[23:38:12] <__adrian> re: firewall: the zwave device (the pi) should, yes
[23:38:25] <Dr-007> noord, but its a basic laravel installation. thats why im a little dissapointed with the load times. my self build site is alot quicker
[23:38:36] <Dr-007> but i dont trust my self build site enough to grant access to the web
[23:38:38] <TML> __adrian: The project description answered that right as I hit send :)
[23:38:42] <Dr-007> so im transfering it to laravel
[23:39:03] <Dr-007> to ensure its safe
[23:39:23] <Dr-007> well. thanks again
[23:39:26] <Dr-007> im off
[23:39:32] <noord> Dr-007: it can not be fast as raw php files, it is a tradeoff between speed and flexibility
[23:39:57] <__adrian> Dr-007: again, there's no reason/basis to compare it to your other site. there's likely an incredible difference in complexity/capability.
[23:40:29] <Dr-007> yeah the thousand includes that happen in laravel
[23:40:39] <Dr-007> that makes it slow
[23:40:50] * Dr-007 thinks
[23:40:56] <__adrian> a framework is not, for example, "twice as complex" aa a loose collection of php webpages
[23:41:11] <TML> Dr-007: you can test your assertion with a little bit of profiling work
[23:41:28] <__adrian> your pi's memory footprint would be the bigger problem there
[23:41:50] <__adrian> no room to cache all of the files and they're probably ejected every request
[23:42:06] <Dr-007> oh yeah, thats for sure
[23:42:12] <Dr-007> TML: i got a benchmark somewhere
[23:42:22] <__adrian> so you're going to burn out your sd card too
[23:42:25] <TML> Dr-007: Benchmarks and profiling aren't the same thing
[23:42:27] <__adrian> profiling, not benchmarking
[23:42:47] <TML> Dr-007: Bencmarks are proof that something is/isn't slow; profiling is exploring what, exactly, is slow
[23:43:04] <Dr-007>  Timing cached reads:   222 MB in  2.01 seconds = 110.63 MB/sec  .... Timing buffered disk reads:  46 MB in  3.04 seconds =  15.15 MB/sec
[23:43:11] <Dr-007> oh, ok
[23:43:11] <TML> Yeah, useless info
[23:43:22] <TML> Try profiling the code :)
[23:43:34] <Dr-007> what do you recommend?
[23:43:49] <noord> Dr-007: stopwatch :)
[23:43:54] <TML> xdebug has some profiling powers
[23:44:08] <__adrian> which way to New York? "it's about 2500 miles away" ok, but which way? "2500 miles. MILES."
[23:44:08] <TML> https://xdebug.org/
[23:44:39] <TML> noord: Stopwatches are for benchmarking, not profiling
[23:46:11] <noord> TML: it is not profiler but handles simple use cases
[23:46:22] <TML> Dr-007: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-0HpCblt3A shows one type of profiling if you've never done it before, might help you understand the context
[23:46:39] <__adrian> noord: they've already passed the simple case
[23:46:49] <Dr-007> ok, thanks
[23:46:51] <__adrian> already know it takes too long

[23:51:33] <da_wunder> for profiling I would recommend blackfire - https://blackfire.io/docs/introduction

[23:53:33] <TML> hmm - seems more APM-ish - not that this is a bad thing, just not always my first preference for profiling
[23:53:48] <da_wunder> eg. there is one bug that I found from Symfony a while ago - https://blackfire.io/profiles/compare/05923414-4007-4492-969d-5339a0d3dad8/graph

[23:55:57] <TML> da_wunder: You mean that's why the numbers are negative? It's comparing the result to some previous iteration?
[23:56:14] <da_wunder> yes
