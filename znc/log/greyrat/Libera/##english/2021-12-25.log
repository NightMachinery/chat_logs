[21:12:50] <mikrosis> hi
[21:13:09] <mikrosis> when I say "Happy holidays!", can this be offensive to some people? I try not being offensive.
[21:14:03] <ania123> any help?
[21:14:27] <mikrosis> "Happy holidays!" or "Merry christmas!"? Or "Happy Noel!"
[21:14:29] <blkshp> ania123: it's ok as it is but...
[21:14:38] <mikrosis> what can I use in the anglosphere that offends the least amount of people
[21:14:39] <ania123> but?
[21:15:31] <blkshp> with full responsibility > responsibly. remember even one time > remember a time. besides to tasks > besides the tasks
[21:15:45] <blkshp> mikrosis: you will never not irritate someone.
[21:16:17] <mikrosis> blkshp: you are right
[21:16:31] <blkshp> If you say happy holidays the people that think everyone should celebrate Christmas will whine. If you say Merry Christmas, the ones that dont celebrate Christmas will whine.
[21:16:36] <mikrosis> blkshp: so the question rather is (the sad question): who should be irritated the least
[21:16:43] <mikrosis> right
[21:16:45] <mikrosis> damn
[21:16:55] <mikrosis> though "Happy holidays" seems neutral and right to me.
[21:17:56] <blkshp> See English born and raised, i say "Merry Christmas" unless I know someone doesn't celebrate Christmas when I just say whatever i think of at the time
[21:19:11] <mikrosis> Atheists that still celebrate the aspect of the season (lights, gifts, atmosphere) - so "Happy holidays" seems more appropriate
[21:19:28] <blkshp> But atheists will also accept Merry Christmas.
[21:20:37] <blkshp> I think reasonable people would accept either.
[21:20:40] <mikrosis> ah I see
[21:20:41] <mikrosis> yes
[21:20:45] <mikrosis> the context is important
[21:20:49] <blkshp> Unreasonable people, well they can f**k off :D!
[21:20:53] <mikrosis> right lol
[21:20:59] <blkshp> xD
[21:21:50] <blkshp> It does seem to be consensus that "Happy Holidays" is the more acceptable term to not get you in trouble with others though but whether people prefer it, that's another story.
[21:22:54] <mikrosis> "Live long and prosper \/"
[21:23:23] <blkshp> Peace and long life.

[21:36:46] <GuiToris> how long have you been following me?
[21:38:53] <blkshp> Your New Years resolution should be to eradicate the one thing that you do that really pisses me off.

[22:03:44] <blkshp> et tu
[22:03:56] <jemius> How would you interpret the expression "state quota". How is the word "quota" mist commonly interpreted in English?
[22:04:06] <jemius> *most
[22:04:24] <blkshp> An assigned allowance
[22:05:39] <jemius> "[students] are eligible to get a quota for enrolling in one of the Master degree programs covered by the Olympiad subject areas in higher education institutions"
[22:06:33] <jemius> "The state quota (hereinafter - the quota) is established by the Government for foreign citizens and stateless persons, who want to continue their education"
[22:07:06] <jemius> I understand this as: We allow 40% from country X, 20% from country Y etc. --> quota
