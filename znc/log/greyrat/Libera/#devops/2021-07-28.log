[03:25:44] <lantech19446> heroku is a cloud provider? I thought that was just a backend for web apps
[03:32:53] <rawtaz> well their service is a cloudish thing so i guess anyone liking the hype and buzzwords would like to call them a cloud provider
[03:33:11] <rawtaz> dont you deploy your webapps there? if so they are not just a backend are they?

[06:28:38] <lantech19446> I've never had the benefit of a team where each person had different strengths
[07:57:04] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Lone Wolf is not a bad position to be into, as long as later you can cuddle with others. Also, relying on others is overrated :P

[15:34:22] <rawtaz> lantech19446: but thats different. learning everything you need to, which you have been doing, is one thing. learning everything you hear about even though its not relevant is a different matter and not needed.
