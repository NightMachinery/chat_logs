[00:59:58] <saturn2> evidently the anon feature doesn't hide anything in the API since greaterwrong continued happily showing the usernames without any errors
[01:02:58] <gwern> I figured it was either that or it was caching the real name
[01:06:01] <gwern> either way, a 'stupid' error
[01:10:02] <saturn2> oh yeah, it does cache userid/name pairs
[01:12:19] <kuudes> clearly it should not show userid if it wants the user to be anonymous?
[01:13:13] <saturn2> yes, i believe you could find any user's id in the wayback machine
[01:15:26] <gwern> pretty awkward for it to be anonymous but actually a pseudonym already linked to the original...
[01:15:34] <kuudes> well user ids clearly are person information per gdpr etc
[01:36:13] <ggreer> one issue is that every cloud provider has resource limits to prevent orgs from accidentally overspending (or to prevent them from getting a massive bill because they were hacked). you have to manually ask for higher limits and get them approved by a human
[01:36:55] <gwern> that's just a form though
[01:37:16] <gwern> (it's not like it's a video call or anything. at least at all the tiers I've had to request limits lifted.)
[01:38:10] <ggreer> approval can take a while. at higher levels there's usually a call with a sales person to figure out payment and bulk discounts
[01:38:54] <ggreer> one workaround would be to hack a big org's cloud account and repurpose it for comute
[01:38:57] <ggreer> *compute
[01:39:14] <gwern> indeed. that happens later
[01:40:05] <ggreer> that said, details like that aren't a big deal. once the program is off its original hardware, it's game over
[01:43:23] <gwern> yeah. it's more about making it plausible that it can eat 10x or 100x the compute to achieve a dangerous capability spike given the thoroughly-established scaling laws

[02:34:11] <gwern> (so the question eventually becomes, is X hours of time and comfort worth breaking down the door?

[03:49:57] <saturn2> however, trying to get it directly, rather than through a comment, results in an "operation not allowed" error, which prevented GW from noticing the account had been deactivated, which would have normally caused it to anonymize all associated comments...

[04:09:33] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so, on a more positive topic than mark's bullshit or this He dude lowkey trying to cancel me for calling mark on his BS, what is this amazing reader-mode idea you dangled in the morning? even if you're not done with a prototype, surely you can at least describe it
[04:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's a simple concept, in two parts. Part 1: ok, so toggling link styling "on the fly", as it were, causes reflow due to the link icons and pop-frame indicators, but... what if... we just kept those hidden? Toggle *only* the underlining??? Wouldn't that achieve much of the same effect? (And then the linkicons and indicators can be shown on hover... or possibly even there's extra hackery to improve that aspect of it,
[04:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  we'll see) ... Part 2: This aspect of reader-mode is primarily or exclusively for desktops (no "hover" on mobile, long press is not a good idea for that, probably mobile users just get the full manual toggle plus auto-reveal on scroll to end) - and what do desktops have? That's right: keyboards. And isn't there already a UX idiom for keyboard-triggered temporary reveal of interactivity indicators on UI elements? Why, yes,
[04:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  there is: "hold down the Alt key"
[04:17:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So: hovering over a link reveals (underlining only) all links, PLUS a message (in say the lower left corner, or somewhere - not decided yet) saying e.g. "hold Alt key to reveal links", and of course holding down the Alt key does exactly that
[04:17:55] <gwern> ("You abandon a link icon. It's crying. You want to go back for it. But you know you shouldn't.")
[04:18:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I have tested the basic implementation and it works flawlessly and performantly
[04:18:30] <gwern> uh. that's a UX idiom?
[04:18:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... yes
[04:18:59] <gwern> is this a mac thing? I'm not sure I've ever in my life 'held down Alt to temporarirly reveal interactivity indicators'
[04:19:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's literally an "everything BUT a Mac" thing
[04:19:30] <pie__> the closest I can remember is pressing alt on windows to bring up the popup menus on the to menu bar thing maybe
[04:19:33] * gwern swaps into firefox and emacs. hitting alt doesn't seem to do anything
[04:19:34] <adiabatic> "hold down alt to show indicators" is a Windows thing after they stopped always showing underlines for menu items all the time

[04:22:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anyway, point is, hovering over a link would result in you being TOLD that you could hold Alt
[04:23:49] <gwern> yes, I'm just wondering if, since I am extremely skeptical this is any kind of widely known keybinding, if 'Alt' is a good choice. I could see arguments for, say, 'Esc' (you 'escape' reader mode, and using 'Esc' for breaking modals is very well known)
[04:24:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alt is the only possible choice
[04:24:54] <gwern> maybe we can bind Esc too, it's quite instinctive

[05:45:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Reading A. Merritt's _The Moon Pool_ (another Appendix N entry). A significantly earlier work than _Creep, Shadow!_, writing correspondingly less polished, style less confident. The book is much longer than it initially seems like it should be; it starts off like a "weird tale" in the usual Lovecraft/etc. tradition, but then segues smoothly into a pulp fantasy adventure, exploring a lost subterranean society and so on.
[05:46:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: who has time for sanity-shattering horrors when there's hot fish-women to rescue?
[05:46:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Features one of Merritt's apparently trademark villainous Russians, but the way the character's presented is one I didn't quite expect (though should have, if I'd thought about it!):

[05:48:25] <Obormot\Gaia> So the protagonists discover the ruins of an ancient civilization, wherein lies a door into a subterranean chamber, which can be opened only by moonlight, when the moon is full. This is problematic for reasons, but they devise a way to get inside... and are promptly shot at from behind by this Russian, a Professor Marakinoff, who has been observing this door and lying in wait etc.

And here are you, Lieutenant O'Keefe of the English wolves, and you Dr. Goodwin of the Yankee pack—and here in this place may be that will

[06:06:32] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, the efficiency gains come with huge batches: "Given this, you might be shocked that anybody uses PyTorch at all, but keep in mind that modern deep learning models are often performing massive operations. Moreover, frameworks like PyTorch execute asynchronously. That is, while PyTorch is running a CUDA kernel, it can continue and queue up more CUDA kernels behind it.

[06:40:30] <gwern> hm. I think I disagree there. I was always unsure what the point of the staggering was, and I definitely think most people will look at it and go 'that's a mistake, lame'
[06:41:31] <gwern> what does the staggering do to be worth so conspicously and deliberately breaking expectations of symmetry and geometry?
[06:43:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It is "deliberate imperfection", whose aesthetic function is masking accidental imperfection (like small aberrations in v-centering of text that, when highlighted by symmetric/repeating layouts, irritates the eye)
[06:43:32] <gwern> maybe we can push the lower line further right and try to line them up at 2/3rds or something?
[06:43:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then it won't be a rectangle overall
[06:44:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[06:44:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright let me play around with this a bit and I'll see
[06:45:01] <gwern> it would still be the exact same size overall, I mean just shift the top pair's middle boundary leftwards, and the bottom pair's middle boundary rightwards
[06:45:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Although personally I think you should just tell people that it's deliberate and that if they don't understand that then they're philistines
[06:45:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Solve this problem by sneering instead of doing work
[06:45:46] <gwern> always a temptation. but we should save the sneering for later because if we use up our allotted sneers hastily, divine irony ensures we'll run out
[06:46:49] <gwern> (we'll turn down a side-street from a night at the bar, when suddenly, out of the sudden, materialize a gang of grad student thugs and hooligans wearing the gang colors of Sneerclub! and our sneer holsters will be empty!)
[06:47:11] <superz__> lol
[06:47:23] <gwern> you laugh, but Murphy is the only god I worship
[06:47:52] <gwern> and what do we say as we place offerings in front of his shrine? We say only one thing to Murphy: "Not today. Please god not today"
[06:48:19] <gwern> (the offerings are things like backup drives and spare tires)

[06:58:45] <gwern> I think I would go with the square one just because it makes sense. the staggered one just leaves me looking at it going 'but why?'
[06:58:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[07:00:03] <gwern> if it was aligned to 1/3rds vs 2/3rds I think that would visually make sense, but that one which shifts it like 1/10th left and 1/10th right is... "what?"
[07:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Pull
[07:00:17] <gwern> I can't even blame people for assuming it's a fuckup
[07:00:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I blame people... but eh, this is not important enough for me to even argue about
[07:00:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> In any case I fixed the tiny v-centering issues
[07:00:56] <gwern> yeah, it's another one of those 'things you can't countersignal' or 'poweruser features'
[07:01:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it should look more perfect regardless
[07:01:48] <gwern> just like mark thinks I'm a mouth-breathing moron and so all in-universe mistakes or mistakes of his own must be *my* mistakes, most web users have such low opinions of websites they assume the staggering is just an error and wasn't there for your vertical alignment reason

[08:57:24] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: Karpathy claims that it doesn't make sense to use tanh activations in a network when you are using dropout because it "has an active range of [-1,1]" here https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/, and replaces tanh with ReLUs. That doesn't make sense to me - symmetric activation functions take 0 and return 0 so there's no contribution of dropped neurons anyway. What am I missing here?

[09:07:53] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: idk, does seem like a weird statement
[09:08:12] <PapuaHardyNet> good to hear you feel the same way
[09:10:15] <nshepperd2> i could imagine a dropout that set the activations to -1 for "biologically inspired" reasons that it should set the activation to minimum but that seems silly tbh
[09:11:26] <PapuaHardyNet> negative value is information, which means the dropout results in an entirely different network instead of a network without that specific neuron
[09:12:11] <PapuaHardyNet> Perhaps it might work as a sort of "adverserial dropout" where each neuron cannot trust that the other neurons are telling the right thing? That doesn't sound like a good idea
[09:15:36] <nshepperd2> dropout that sets activations to 0 with sigmoid activation is equivalent to dropout that sets activations to -1 with tanh activation
[09:16:27] <nshepperd2> because tanh = 2 * sigmoid - 1
[09:17:07] <nshepperd2> which is a affine transformation which you can absorb into the linear layer params
[09:21:21] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. I thought dropout means you make the weight of the weight matrix 0, not that you make the activation of the layer 0
[09:23:24] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if the input is 0, but the activation layer then outputs 0.5 (because you are using sigmoid), that *might* be a problem depending on the network.
[09:24:02] <PapuaHardyNet> But with tanh, I don't think you *want* the input to be -1, because then the output won't be 0.

[09:42:44] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: nope, you apply it to the activations
[09:44:55] <PapuaHardyNet> weird!
[09:47:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you use a special layer called the "dropout layer" in pytorch that does the dropout
[09:47:28] <PapuaHardyNet> while wikipedia literally defines weights such that you do dropout on it
[09:49:00] <nshepperd2> yep
[09:49:19] <nshepperd2> the dropout layer just takes some input and zeros out x% of the values

[17:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well it looks like they transitioned to a bizarre design where they have a MathML element followed by a pre-rendered PNG fallback image, and, having done this, they hide the MathML and show the fallback image unconditionally
[17:05:01] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the title definitely did use to pop up and was the intended way to open up the raw WP article. I do not remember deciding against this, so looks like a bug. casaulty of linklive rewrite?
[17:05:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: BUT because of the way we process/clean WP API responses before showing annotations, what we end up with is both the MathML and the image showing in the WP annotations, which is (a) redundant, (b) breaks some popup layous
[17:05:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> So ... I guess I need to fix that... it's... just such a weird thing for them to do :\
[17:05:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> enterprisey: ^ do you know anything about this
[17:06:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Possibly. It does, as I said, get the `no-popup` class, which I think means it's some backend code doing that... I dunno. Nothing I did should do that, I think?
[17:06:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it looks like no-popup is set in popups.js unconditionally, nothing to do with... so the problem is titles in regular popups get link-live class inserted but the WP-specific code forgets to do that
[17:07:25] <gwern> something like that?
[17:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah hm yes that makes snese
[17:07:47] * Obormot\Arcturus looks
[17:08:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm. Titles in annotations get `link-live` when generated, i.e. at build time...
[17:08:59] <gwern> aha. so the WP-specific code was not updated to know it needs to inject that

Reports of Russia’s “escalate to de-escalate” strategy were emerging. The idea of the game was to test whether this strategy might indeed thwart America’s ability or
[18:03:00] <feepbot> will to project power in Europe. The scenario went like this: The Russians invade one of the Baltic states; NATO fights back effectively; to reverse the tide, Russia fires a low-yield nuclear weapon at the NATO troops or at a base in Germany where drones, combat planes, and smart bombs were deployed. The question: What do U.S. decision-makers do next?'

[19:48:17] <Robomot> psych/illusion-of-depth Directory Listing · Gwern.net (Annotated bibliography of files in the directory /docs/psychology/illusion-of-depth/, most recent first.)
[19:49:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah I see
[19:49:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> A tag. I thought this was a new essay I'd missed
[19:50:13] <gwern> it was originally part of a draft essay trying to bound how much complexity an individual human personality/mind might be. the more illusory depth you have, the less there is
[19:50:56] <gwern> like the scenery on a stage suggesting an entire vivid complex world, but behind it is just some discarded wrapping paper, old props, and rats
[19:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I don't really understand these directory structure links. psychology/illusion-of-depth links with a "sideways" arrow to ... biology/portia? because... why?
[19:53:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: because portia does what seems like really complex intelligent behavior involving planning and hiding and customized trickery of each individual prey spider, and yet, it has practically no neurons
[19:53:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That's fascinating and yet does nothing to answer my question, which is about the UX design of this feature :p
[19:53:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Basically you're saying "because it's related", right?
[19:54:05] <gwern> oh. yes, it's related
[19:54:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then it should be in a separate link section
[19:54:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> The way it's organized and styled right now, with the arrows, and right under "Parent^", it suggests that it's a link to ... maybe a sibling page in the same dir? A child? Something like that
[19:55:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in fact none of those things are true
[19:55:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's merely "related", which is unclear (a) how it relates to "Parent" and why it's therefore in the same block of links, (b) what that has to do with a right arrow
[19:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, imo, make a subheading "Related", put links like the portia link there, strip the arrow from them
[19:56:30] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, the illusion of depth concept very much ties into people's models of other people
[19:56:59] <gwern> "I have depth. You thoughtlessly follow simple rules. He is a mindless automaton."
[19:57:10] <RiversHaveWings> "Children and adults, like many ancient philosophers, believe that seeing involves emissions from the eye. Several experiments tested the strength of these “extramission” beliefs to determine whether they, like other scientific misconceptions, are resistant to educational experiences. Traditional college-level education had little impact."
[19:57:11] <RiversHaveWings> What
[19:57:16] <gwern> inorite
[19:57:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Separately from that, the link "Parent" should indicate what it is. (Yes I know it's redundant with the page title, with the URL bar, with all manner of things - trust me, people will miss 100% of those things and be confused and lost. Source: me. And if even me, then...)
[19:57:28] <RiversHaveWings> I mean raytracing literally does work that way for computational efficiency
[19:57:59] <gwern> yup. but it's not like raytracing in a game literally shoots out light even in a dark room! it's just 'virtual' light. a computational hack
[19:58:08] <mjr> RiversHaveWings, the people just see through the Matrix
[19:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (So e.g. "Parent (/docs/psychology/)", with the `/docs/psychology/` being a code element)
[19:58:24] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah. The rays go out from the camera and then it tests if they can reach the light sources.
[19:58:33] <gwern> it's amazing that it's a theory held by as many people as it is. just the simple question: "so why can't you see when you turn off the lights?"
[19:58:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: btw, it's `psychology/illusion-of-depth`, but the page title says "psych/illusion-of-depth" - Inconsistent, therefore confusing!
[19:59:03] <PapuaHardyNet> now I get why raytracing works that way - it is because we don't actually care about raytracing at any other point other than the camera
[19:59:33] <PapuaHardyNet> its the same thing as backpropogation and front propogation of gradients
[19:59:38] <RiversHaveWings> yeah. you can actually simulate rays coming from light sources and bouncing around until they hit the camera but you will waste orders of magnitude processing time doing this
[19:59:49] <PapuaHardyNet> (okay no it is not the same, sorry for that analogy)
[19:59:51] <RiversHaveWings> because the vast majority of rays will end up attenuated.
[20:00:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: mm. I think this is an example of the conflict between the category structure of directories and the tags. to my mind, there is not much difference between 'portia' and any subdirectory illusion-of-depth might have. I could have put portia inside illusion-of-depth without much qualm
[20:00:53] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I will add a tag title to make that 'the illusion of depth'
[20:01:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Be that as it may, the user cannot read your mind and will absolutely not, ever, *ever*, make that connection
[20:01:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> It involves like three separate inferences!
[20:01:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most people make zero, as you know
[20:01:59] <gwern> any plan that requires 3 separate inferences is doomed to failure by yudkowsky's law of ultrafinite recursion
[20:02:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... so save everyone the trouble, make a Related section, done deal
[20:02:29] <gwern> but another header would use up *so* much vertical space ;_;

[20:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> We will style it specially in popups (already on my to-do, you may recall), and outside of them it's fine
[20:03:46] <gwern> should it be 'related'? I don't use that term. the section in articles is usually 'See Also'

[23:04:26] <feep> it's like, normal ketchup is like... gloopy and sweet
[23:04:29] <gwern> it's kind of a creepy name tho
[23:04:44] <kuudes> if you guys want to say hi to dbohdan, I feel now could be a good time
[23:04:45] <linear> what is bio-ketchup
[23:04:54] <feep> guess :p
[23:05:15] <gwern> can't you imagine the horror movie? _Born Ketchup_. "This new village seems friendly." "Hello newcomer. Won't you come... ketchup with us?"
[23:05:33] <feep> it's just german for spring, ie. the water feature
[23:05:44] <gwern> this is raising so many more questions
[23:06:13] <feep> they're mostly known for their mustard
[23:06:18] <gwern> you're telling me it's harvested from a ketchup spring?! forget the sanitation, where are all the tomatoes coming from and how are they being pureed automatically underground?!
[23:06:23] <feep> ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Feinkost )
[23:06:24] <Robomot> Born Feinkost - Wikipedia (Born Feinkost GmbH is a food company from Erfurt, Germany. It is mainly known for its mustard, which is traditionally served accompanying Thüringer Bratwurst (Thuringian sausage).)
[23:07:04] <feep> gwern: it was founded by the brothers wilhelm and louis born.
[23:07:13] <gwern> oh my god they really were born ketchup
[23:07:22] <feep> ... okay yes granted
[23:07:40] <gwern> how long has this ketchup clan been feeding unsuspecting germans from their sinister ketchup spring
[23:07:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The lost subterranean civilization the Born brothers founded grows and purees the tomatoes, and pipes it up to the surface; the pipes are of course disguised as springs (to avoid suspicion)
[23:07:50] * feep checks wiki
[23:07:53] <gwern> the ketchup is made of people
[23:08:04] <feep> 1820 apparently
[23:08:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: "Nobody goes in. Nobody goes out. They say it's run by little people."
[23:08:50] <gwern> until... the golden brown mustard tub is announced. the world goes wild
[23:09:03] <feep> anyway, I have no idea how to get it outside germany :/
[23:09:28] <gwern> everyone desperate to get their hands on golden tubs for a tour of the magical born factory and perhaps... chosen as heir to the culinary fortune?
[23:09:40] <gwern> if you cut the mustard
[23:09:57] <feep> ... gdi
[23:10:10] <gwern> but the lucky winning children will need to muster all their salt and vinegar if they want to ketchup with Mr Born
[23:11:16] <feep> ....... anyway according to https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/08240110/tomaten-ketchup-born it has sugar content 23% below average for ketchup

[23:12:00] <gwern> and all the while, the sinister agents of Heinz lurk, trying to steal born's secret sauce
[23:12:33] <gwern> 2 centuries ago, Born and Heinz were best friends. but then things went... sour
[23:13:03] <gwern> their relationship was pulped into tiny bloody red bits. like a tomato.
[23:13:12] <feep> okay yes we get it.
[23:13:18] <gwern> the resentment fermented - oh fine

[23:24:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "His name first attracted attention when it appeared in the 1938 Philadelphia telephone directory on page 1292, column 3, line 17,[9]:140 and in a court order of judge John Boyle of May 25, 1938: "Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff, Jr., etc., vs. Yellow Cab Co., petition for compromise settlement granted" with speculation that the case was settled because "they couldn't pronounce it".[9]:150"
[23:25:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Philadelphia's business computers used an abbreviated form on the city's voting registration books; the utility company, however, when told he would not pay his bill unless his name was right, began spelling it properly, on three lines."

[23:26:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff claimed that his great-grandfather composed the surname in the 19th century, when German Jews were obliged to take a second name.[24] In some printings of the above-noted AP wire story, Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff himself provided the following explanation of his prodigious surname:[25]
[23:27:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>     It tells a story of a wolf-killer, a resident of a stonehouse in a village, whose ancestors were conscientious shepherds whose sheep were well fed and carefully guarded against attack by ferocious enemies and whose ancestors 1,200,000 years before the first earth man, in a space ship made with tungsten and seven iridium motors and using light as a source of power, started a long journey across interstellar space, searching
[23:27:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  for a star around which was an inhabitable planet where they could establish a new race of intelligent mankind and where they would live long, happy lives and be free from attack by other intelligentsia from the outer space from whence they came."

[23:57:31] <Betawolf> Right, I was thinking that even with bubble effects and people keeping their faith quiet, there's no way the US would seem quite _so_ secular if atheism was that low.
