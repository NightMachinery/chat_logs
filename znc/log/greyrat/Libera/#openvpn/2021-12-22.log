[02:08:01] <UncleKiwi> hi there, i have been struggling to get a client to connec to a basic openvpn setup using client cert for auth 
[02:08:18] <UncleKiwi> OpenSSL: error:141FC044:SSL routines:tls_setup_handshake:internal error
[02:08:23] <UncleKiwi> getting errors like that 
[02:08:42] <UncleKiwi> its a fanvil VoIP device
[02:09:07] <UncleKiwi> I installed debian and installed openvpn from the repo
[02:09:44] <UncleKiwi> I experimentned with tls-version-min 1.1 etc
[02:09:55] <UncleKiwi> im just not having muich joyu 
[02:10:25] <UncleKiwi> maybe the certs I made a no good
[02:14:55] <rob0> openssl errors are never very informative
[02:15:07] <UncleKiwi> hi rob0
[02:15:11] <UncleKiwi> yeah 
[02:15:22] <UncleKiwi> im just about to reload the box
[02:15:30] <UncleKiwi> with rocky linux
[02:15:42] <UncleKiwi> and start again 
[02:15:51] <UncleKiwi> instead of debian
[02:16:03] <rob0> well, maybe you want to just start again with your PKI
[02:16:17] <UncleKiwi> yeah probably would be better
[02:16:33] <ordex> if your pipe leaks, normally you don't move to a new flat
[02:16:34] <ordex> :D
[02:16:48] <UncleKiwi> yeah true ordex
[02:17:04] <ordex> just kidding :) but starting with a clean PKI as rob0 suggested is a good idea
[02:17:26] <ordex> just create a new pki with easyrsa3 and default parameters - that normally works
[02:17:38] <rob0> I actually did, in 1986, when my upstairs neighbor had a pipe leak :)
[02:17:46] <ordex> however, it's very possible that the system on your phone is very constrained and won't support everything
[02:17:57] <rob0> our ceiling collapsed!
[02:17:59] <ordex> rob0: hehe, it depends on how severe it is :p
[02:18:03] <ordex> indeed
[02:18:08] <UncleKiwi> im building a new house soon
[02:18:28] <UncleKiwi> the prices are going up for that 
[02:18:33] <rob0> oh yes
[02:18:53] <UncleKiwi> but im going to do it anyway 
[02:19:53] <UncleKiwi> I stayed awake all night trying to get this working 
[02:20:27] <UncleKiwi> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-debian-10
[02:20:34] <UncleKiwi> I followed this guide
[02:21:27] <UncleKiwi> it looks like they download easyrsa from git
[02:22:03] <UncleKiwi> wget -P ~/ https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases/download/v3.0.6/EasyRSA-unix-v3.0.6.tgz
[02:22:16] <UncleKiwi> is that the correct way 
[02:22:23] <ordex> it's one way
[02:22:27] <ordex> should be fine
[02:22:46] <ordex> I think 3.0.6 is not the latest, but should not matter much
[02:24:43] <UncleKiwi> the hint that I think that I have messed it up is that the client certs  didnt contain the details I uncommented int he vars file
[02:24:59] <UncleKiwi> I was expecting to see city etc 
[02:25:16] <UncleKiwi> it did set the cert days etc correct
[02:32:32] <UncleKiwi> should the server.conf and the ca.crt etc be sitting in the /etc/openvpn directory ?
[02:32:57] <UncleKiwi> I know on a different setup I had then in a server folder

[02:49:27] <ordex> UncleKiwi: there is no yes/no answer, but it depends on the system
[02:49:34] <ordex> and how you launch openvpn
[02:49:46] <ordex> iirc on debian server conf files are expected to be in /etc/openvpn/server
[02:49:53] <ordex> but I might be wrong

[03:05:25] <UncleKiwi> ok I tried redoing the PKI and im still getting errors
[03:05:36] <UncleKiwi> I think its the device 
[03:05:40] <UncleKiwi> that is connecting 
[03:06:29] <UncleKiwi>  TLS error: Unsupported protocol. This typically indicates that client and server have no common TLS version enabled. This can be caused by mismatched tls-version-min and tls-version-max options on client and server. If your OpenVPN client is between v2.3.6 and v2.3.2 try adding tls-version-min 1.0 to the client configuration to use TLS 1.0+ instead of TLS 1.0 only

[03:16:09] <ordex> UncleKiwi: indeed, these are constraints on the phone
[03:16:17] <ordex> it may be running some very old openvpn and openssl
[03:16:27] <UncleKiwi> yeah probably aye
[03:16:44] <ordex> but tls-version-min 1.0 might be part of the workaround (not recommended though, but seems you have no choice)

[03:53:28] <UncleKiwi> ok yeah - I just tested with a grandstream phone and it was fine
[03:53:44] <UncleKiwi> so it seems the fanvil probably is really outdated
[03:57:37] <UncleKiwi> is there a way to tell openvpn server that it can accept almost any ciphers

[07:10:40] <UncleKiwi> ok guys, I have been told the device will only work with openvpn ver 2.3
[07:10:55] <UncleKiwi> does that mean that will be insecure ?
[07:10:59] <UncleKiwi> and a risk ?
[07:11:53] <UncleKiwi> the one in the repo is openvpn 2.5.1
[07:12:17] <UncleKiwi> does that even make sence that it would not work with version later than 2.3

[10:17:51] <UncleKiwi> I would have thought it would have been more the version of openssl
