[07:50:17] <KP8263> Hi I am writing a sub query for the first time, I don't think a join will work, as its one table converted and from the new table the data is further refined.
[07:50:34] <KP8263> How would I share it here to have it reviewed and get some suggestions?
[07:55:26] <Xgc> KP8263: dbfiddle.uk
[07:56:13] <Xgc> KP8263: Add the CREATE TABLE statements first.  Then your query should run without errors, if it's in the proper form.
[07:56:41] <Xgc> KP8263: Which database are you using?
[07:58:35] <KP8263> MySQL
[07:58:43] *** Quits: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:58:43] <KP8263> My table is already created.
[07:58:49] <KP8263> https://dbfiddle.uk/markdown?rdbms=sqlserver_2019&fiddle=4220e86d98e462fd56f28292cc45ba16
[07:59:16] <KP8263> I keep getting a syntax error,
[07:59:44] <KP8263> You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'COUNT(`PathID`)
[07:59:45] <KP8263>   FROM `routing`
[07:59:45] <KP8263>   GROUP BY `properties.station_name`
[07:59:46] <KP8263>   HA...' at line 16
[08:08:26] <Xgc> KP8263: dbfiddle.uk would be better.
[08:08:54] <Xgc> KP8263: with the CREATE TABLE statements.
[08:09:47] <Xgc> KP8263: It's tough to check the SQL unless the tables are present in the fiddle.
[08:10:48] <Xgc> KP8263: One big problem is you don't have the right table names in the FROM clause.
[08:11:16] <Xgc> KP8263: SELECT `properties.name`  is not a proper column reference unless that represents the entire column name.
[08:11:45] <Xgc> KP8263: Typically properties (the table) and name (the column) is written:  SELECT properties.name, ...
[08:12:17] <Xgc> KP8263: But you didn't refer to that table in any FROM clause.
[08:13:12] <Xgc> KP8263: That entire UNION mess before the COUNT expression is wrong.  That's why it chokes on the COUNT term.
[08:13:47] <Xgc> KP8263: I can't tell what you intended to do here.
[08:15:13] * Xgc wanders off...
[08:15:19] <KP8263> properties.name is an entire column reference
[08:15:42] <Xgc> KP8263: What is the name of the table?
[08:15:55] <KP8263> the first table is trains
[08:16:02] <KP8263> the inner query runs just fine.
[08:16:05] <KP8263> as is.
[08:16:18] <Xgc> KP8263: So you have a column called [properties.name] in a table called trains?
[08:16:24] <KP8263> yes
[08:16:35] <Xgc> KP8263: Please add that CREATE TABLE statement to the fiddle.
[08:16:46] <KP8263> okay, one min
[08:16:57] <Xgc> and you're using SQL Server 2019?
[08:17:11] <Xgc> It looks more like you're using MySQL.
[08:17:27] <Xgc> But you chose the wrong engine in dbfiddle.uk
[08:34:05] <KP8263> I think its actually a MariaDB that I am using, it was MySQL and then changed.

[09:05:47] <Xgc> KP8263: Yes. I see it.  Now what is the purpose of the SQL?  What did you expect that to generate?
[09:06:35] <Xgc> KP8263: The SQL is meaningless.  So I first need to a high level understanding of what you intended to do.
[09:11:36] <Xgc> KP8263: You probably intended [routing] to be a derived table or CTE term.  But you added it directly in the SELECT list.  That's just invalid in every database, and in the SQL standard.
[09:16:12] <Xgc> KP8263: The SELECT * ... GROUP BY `properties.station_name` ... is curious and just wrong / invalid.  Having said that, MariaDB is one of the few databases which does not recognize the error.  MySQL added proper handling of this (functional dependence) in 5.7.  That never made it into MariaDB.
[09:16:50] <Xgc> KP8263: Lots of things you need to explain before coming up with an alternative.
