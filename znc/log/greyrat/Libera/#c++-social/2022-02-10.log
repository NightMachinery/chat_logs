[11:22:34] <Carbonflux> yup
[11:23:38] <Carbonflux> honestly i am a bit optimistic about carbon based computing, a lot of the heat problems go away, we can make 3D circuits and we don't need rare earths.
[11:28:08] <Carbonflux> what i want is for graphics technology to stabilize, ray tracing gets us closer to that and carbon computing will enable use to make computing cores so cheap photoreal rendering will be the baseline, then we can focus on algorithms and world building rather than also playing catchup with the incrementalism of chip makers.
[11:28:42] <Renderwww> what carbon based substance have you been smoking?
[11:32:24] <Carbonflux> those nanotubes

[12:36:17] <jotham> we had 308 omicron cases today
[12:36:47] <jotham> https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/450874/covid-19-data-visualisations-nz-in-numbers
[12:37:24] <Crocodillian> that's just one superspreader event at a local bar
[12:37:59] <jotham> how about anti-mandate/vax/5g/1080/qanon/nuremberg/other-dumb-shit protests?
[12:38:08] <jotham> we've had 3+ days of those in front of parliament 
[12:38:18] <Renderwww> do you have honking trucks?
[12:38:47] <jotham> they tried to do a freedom convoy then found they had to get a vaccination to go on the ferry so everyone camped up in a small town and didn't make it to wellington
[12:38:53] <Renderwww> also I have no clue what antivaxers are ranting about but I'm also against any mandate
[12:38:56] <Crocodillian> nuremberg?
[12:39:19] <Renderwww> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code
[12:39:21] <jotham> yeah they tall about 'the nuremberg code'
[12:39:24] <jotham> yep
[12:39:53] <Crocodillian> I see
[12:39:57] <jotham> i watched the protests all day on live stream
[12:40:09] <Crocodillian> what is 1080
[12:40:12] <jotham> gotta love watching clearly facebook radicalized fat middle aged white men get carried off by police one after another
[12:40:31] <jotham> 1080 is a poison my country drops in forest areas to kill rats, mice, stoats, cats, dogs, etc
[12:40:36] <jotham> since they kill the native birds
[12:40:39] <jotham> and birds wont eat 1080
[12:40:53] <jotham> a fringe group of people think its mind contol/polluting the water
[12:41:04] <jotham> they are one of our oldest most consistent protest groups in nz
[12:41:18] <Renderwww> 1080p, they want 4k
[12:41:26] <Crocodillian> well, I don't think that's a very good method of ecosystem balance
[12:41:31] <jotham> great
[12:41:36] <jotham> Crocodillian's cracked the case
[12:41:44] <jotham> something our scientists couldn't do for 50 years
[12:41:56] <Crocodillian> I'm not saying I have a better solution
[12:42:02] <Crocodillian> I just don't think things like this are good
[12:42:06] <Renderwww> haha, he still believes the scientists!
[12:42:16] <jotham> they also use extensive trapping, land management, rangers, and so far have managed to make quite a few islands in NZ pest free so nearly extinct birds can come back
[12:42:17] <Renderwww> wake up sheeple!
[12:42:50] <Crocodillian> well that's wonderful
[12:44:14] <Crocodillian> I have another idea for managing an invasive species called homo sapiens, we can bring back small carnivorous dinosaurs and let them loose in areas of concentrated populations.
[12:44:53] <Crocodillian> what do you think?
[12:45:07] <jotham> i think you're having a wank on the internet
[12:45:28] <Crocodillian> did you mistake for a serious channel

[12:46:21] <Crocodillian> yeah I know that state very well
[12:46:24] <jotham> i stop working at like 26C
[12:46:37] <jotham> had to debug a live payment gateway for an office building
[12:46:43] <jotham> while wanting to lay down and nap
[12:46:47] <jotham> was fairly annoying
[12:47:03] <jotham> wonder if i should just go back to being nocturnal 
[12:47:19] <ERROH> you like the hands down approach eh
[12:47:28] <Crocodillian> don't you have days when you'd like to let loose a horde of carnivorous dinosaurs at your office building
[12:47:37] <ERROH> can you imagine yourself working as part of a scrum team ham?
[12:47:49] <Renderwww> you need one of those funny hats with a ventilator and solar panel
[12:52:51] <Crocodillian> there's another advantage to the dinosaur solution, all the idiots would die first

[12:54:15] <Crocodillian> we need something like that
[12:59:02] <jotham> ERROH: haha i used to be team lead writing java for the ministry of education
[12:59:08] <jotham> we had daily scrums, but i wasn't the scrum master
[12:59:13] <jotham> and i was regularly fucking outraged
[12:59:25] <jotham> that the dumb solution was better than the good solution
[12:59:32] <jotham> now days i get it, i didn't back then
[12:59:46] <jotham> never be clever when you program, it will fuck you in the arse
[13:00:00] <jotham> doing java for the ministry of education was extremely fucking dull work
[13:02:56] <Crocodillian> you think humans would have ever become anything without the terror of death from big cats and many other things
[13:03:55] <jotham> millions of years of viruses and bacteria trying to eat our face off
[13:03:57] <jotham> not big cats
[13:04:00] <jotham> you're being romantic
[13:04:07] <Renderwww> how did that saying go about not writing as clever code as you can because you have to be twice as clever when you have to debug it?

[14:16:57] <Carbonflux> i don't know, seems like the cancer industry can talk people into taking poison. So many people die from Chemo.
[14:24:30] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: did you see what I said earlier re: carbon chips
[14:25:16] <Carbonflux> yup
[14:25:37] <Carbonflux> i did not feel qualified to form an opinion
[14:26:08] <Carbonflux> i want carbon based computing, personally. So i am imagining it to be so.
[14:26:18] <Carbonflux> i have no idea if it will come to pass.
[14:26:49] <Crocodillian> do you want to know the darkest most guarded secret on this planet
[14:27:15] <Carbonflux> no
[14:27:20] <Crocodillian> good
[14:27:57] <Carbonflux> ya, its better at my age not to know.
[14:30:03] <MaNI> is it the recipe for coke?
[14:32:49] <Carbonflux> it is a dark and secret, good guess.
[14:36:52] <Carbonflux> if i had to guess, it would be the most horrifying thing i can imagine, and yet the best thing; There is no end of the world.
[14:44:31] <T`aZ> or we live in a simulation, and some people hava access to the software
[14:44:48] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:44:53] <T`aZ> meta: it runs linux, so there is an exploit bound to happen
[14:47:02] <Carbonflux> ya, i have been binge watching Sword Art online on Netflix, so i am feeling fairly cynical about admin access.
[14:57:39] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: regarding your earlier point about people being in certain positions because of essentially winning the lottery, I agree with you to a large extent, billionaires describe themselves as "successful" which doesn't really mean shit, they do occasionally need some skills and talent for enterpreneurship but it's still essentially the lottery
[14:59:06] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: but we can go further, if you are shaped by your life experience, you have to have the "fortune" to have those experiences, generally through no purpose/fault of your own
[15:00:01] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: and then there is the question of free will, how much of your "success" or "failure" is due to your own choices
[15:00:53] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: I don't know
[15:02:27] <Carbonflux> well, it think its about fundamental roles the "universe" needs and finds people to fit them. So this "success" is a kind of dream logic place holder.
[15:02:54] <Carbonflux> but it creates its own back story
[15:04:09] <Carbonflux> the problem is that it can't be replicated using the narrative espoused by the in place role player.
[15:04:37] <Carbonflux> so people get frustrated by it or they attribute special talent.
[15:06:55] <hinst> Prof. Dr. Carbonflux
[15:13:06] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: yeah I remember this guy on wall st. saying something like "why are these idiots poor, why don't they become rich like us"
[15:13:48] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: I've learned not to have an agenda anymore, I'm only interested in having pleasant conversations with people who aren't idiots
[15:15:14] <Crocodillian> not that I don't actually have various agendas, everyone does
[15:15:43] <Crocodillian> but I'm not going to go on #politics and shout obscenities at people who have no interest in thinking about anything

[15:39:30] <Renderwww> incel lost to AMD
[15:41:31] <pingpongball> oh i use arch btw.
[15:42:49] <T`aZ> one of us
[15:43:03] <Crocodillian> arch is ok as a vanilla linux distro
[15:43:16] <Crocodillian> nothing terribly bad about it, I used it for docker images sometimes

[15:43:56] <Crocodillian> except for the AUR stuff, that is a hot pile of shit
[15:44:02] <Renderwww> archfatman.png
[15:44:29] <Crocodillian> I'd recommend tumbleweed if you want a higher quality rolling vanilla linux
[15:45:08] <pingpongball> does it have AUR like thing, if i dont get packages

[15:46:27] <Crocodillian> sorry, still getting used to new keyboard, just killed my tmux by accident
[15:46:49] <Crocodillian> yeah it has OBS, which has people maintaining a bunch of non-mainline stuff
[15:47:08] <Crocodillian> but really you should learn to use podman and build stuff yourself when needed
[15:49:41] <Crocodillian> OBS is really cool, you can open kind of pull requests against standard packages etc.
[15:50:54] <Crocodillian> but the most cutting edge in linux distros right now is nixos and guixsd
[15:51:28] <dukwon> nichts OS
[15:51:33] <Renderwww> just flatpak all the things
[15:51:55] <Crocodillian> yeah flatpak/snap can be useful sometimes
[15:52:27] <Crocodillian> you can also use nix on non-nixos
[15:52:30] <pingpongball> Crocodillian nix and guix =D  you are coming to lisp area
[15:52:36] <Crocodillian> and they have a cool thing called home-manager
[15:52:47] <Crocodillian> if you like lisp then you'll love guix
[15:52:56] <Crocodillian> and yeah you can use guix on non-guixsd
[15:53:16] <pingpongball> i'm currently learning lisp by that pcl :)
[15:53:27] <Crocodillian> pcl?
[15:53:28] <pingpongball> although bit weird syntax,
[15:53:33] <pingpongball> practical common lisp
[15:53:36] <Crocodillian> ah
[15:54:04] <Crocodillian> sbcl is extremely powerful and can do a lot of things you can't do or do as easily in C++
[15:54:15] <Crocodillian> I don't know practically anything about CL yet
[15:54:19] <pingpongball> whoah
[15:54:26] <pingpongball> :]
[15:54:49] <pingpongball> if these lisp things were powerful why they decline and not used anymore? main reason
[15:54:52] <Crocodillian> like, you can compile some code in the repl instantly and make it faster than you can easily make any C or C++ code
[15:55:36] <Crocodillian> yeah also try slime for emacs
[15:56:03] <pingpongball> yes i use doom emacs, it is preconfigured and i'm hacking with this common lisp
[15:56:19] <pingpongball> well not hacking , learning
[15:56:20] <Crocodillian> nice, are you using sbcl?
[15:56:27] <pingpongball> i think yes
[15:56:46] <pingpongball> i heard sbcl is fast as c , is it correct?
[15:56:48] <Crocodillian> also check out quicklisp
[15:56:57] <Crocodillian> it's faster than C
[15:57:10] <T`aZ> zomgbbq
[15:57:12] <Crocodillian> in the sense that it's easier to write code that is faster than the idiomatic C code
[15:57:34] <pingpongball> you have such knowledge on lisp
[15:57:48] <Crocodillian> quicklisp is a package/library management thing
[15:58:08] <Crocodillian> yeah I know stuff about it, but I've write practically nothing in it yet
[15:58:08] <pingpongball> right i heard from someone
[15:58:36] <pingpongball> ok guys thanks for

[20:33:53] <dukwon> >>Passports: From Monday, all new Belgian passports feature Tintin, the Smurfs and other heroes of Belgian comic-strip art. It is part of making passports harder to forge and … more fun?
[20:34:28] <Crocodillian> So Belgium invented the smurfs?
[20:34:47] <dukwon> apparently
[20:35:42] <ERROH> our gov the other year tried to update passports with pictures of things that are no longer within our borders
[20:35:50] <ERROH> nationalists have no taste
[20:36:24] <Crocodillian> one of the best things about belgium is those pots of mussels and some of their beers

[20:38:37] <ERROH> i wouldn't even mind czech krtek

[21:01:41] <T`aZ> funfact : the family that inherited the copyright for tintin , is a bunch of crooks, asking and suing every single person using any picture or name or reference to the tintin universe
