[00:02:31] <Patsie> there isn't really a good threading option in any of the awks, but I did implement something for awk-videoplayer

[00:04:53] <Patsie> it's not easy to do though and requires some finicking around
[00:05:30] <Patsie> performance wise it didn't really speed it up that much at all
[00:06:17] <Patsie> it definitely spreads out the data processing acros multiple cores, but the main bottleneck in awk-videoplayer is the displaying part
[00:07:59] <Patsie> and be sure to have a unique string for each command. I just added a '-v thread=%d' to the string so each process has a unique command (not really using the variable in the thread process)

[00:15:40] <user51> maybe a small vm could work. similar to what thy did in the awk book
[00:18:02] <user51> for reference: http://sprunge.us/Pmjo7K
[00:29:15] <tkonto> @Earnestly apparently this is an awk syntax issue
[00:29:17] <tkonto> explaining:
[00:30:05] <tkonto> https://paste.debian.net/1232791/
[00:30:24] <tkonto> so the moment the pattern match is parced by awk, everything falls appart
[00:31:38] <tkonto> so up to grepping and sed'ing all is ok... how to convert the three lines to a single line, tab delimited?
[00:31:47] <tkonto> rephrasing.
[00:31:56] <tkonto> ideally the output should be csv 
[00:41:56] <Patsie> user51: it's quite do-able to make a decent sized emulator in gawk -> https://github.com/patsie75/awk-chip8
[00:42:18] <Patsie> even has a(n) (dis)assembler

[00:45:39] <user51> impressive stuff, makes me wanna retry doing the 8080 emu in awk. iirc the biggest issue was no bit ops, but that can be solved in gawk.

[00:47:58] <user51> screenshot is pretty fancy, i debugged my emu with printf and grep :D
[00:48:28] <Patsie> the youtube video is even more fancy
[00:48:43] <Patsie> but yeah, I couldn't really do this well in anything but gawk
[00:50:21] <user51> i can think of a few smart ways to do it, but it gets into too smart territory
[00:50:25] <Patsie> the 8080 CPU wouldn't be too difficult. it's the rest of the system you want to emulate. video output, keyboard input, other forms of I/O, etc
[00:51:12] <user51> at the time i gave up because i ha no idea how to do it
[00:51:41] <Patsie> well, I cheated a little. chip-8 is easy and all opcodes are 16 bits
[00:52:16] <user51> don't say that, it means you know how to pick your battles :)
