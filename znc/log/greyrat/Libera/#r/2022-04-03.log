[17:06:08] <aitap> Can I use the value of an environment's SEXP (i.e. its pointer) as its identity? In other words, should I assume that an environment's SEXP will remain the same as long as it exists?
[17:16:09] <aitap> As for the reason for the question, I would like to track the lifetime of a bunch of objects. Given an environment, I would like to access a corresponding weak reference containing the metadata for the objects I'm tracking. utils::hashtab can do that for me, but I'd like to target older versions of R, too. I see that environments are hashed by their pointers, but that's definitely an implementation detail.

[22:59:00] <aitap> I think I'll do it. This is seems to be the assumed by a lot of code in core R and isn't destined for CRAN anyway.
