[07:30:07] <user_> how can i mount a FAT32 usb stick *not* read only ?
[07:33:03] <tomreyn> user_: the file system is probably marked as unclean (dirty bit set). you will then need to run windows chkdsk or (less preferably) ubuntu's ntfsfix on it.

[17:09:39] <cxl> Hi all, is there a way to tell Ubuntu to not do cached writes to USB keys or memory cards? I find it very inconvenient that the copy dialog shows that it copies at 500MB/s to a slow USB key and then pretends it's done while slowly actually copying the files from the cache to the actual USB key in the background with no indication on the progress (and messing up with the ability to eject the device)
[17:11:30] <cxl> and more importantly: is it wise to disable caching?
