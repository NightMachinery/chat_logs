[04:16:53] * shawwwn strips gwern for good measure
[04:17:56] <kuudes> it is weird how much airborne spread is still fought against
[04:18:11] <kuudes> as a concept, not as a physical phenomenon, I mean
[04:18:19] <kuudes> we have finally masks
[04:18:25] <kuudes> but no airscrubbers
[04:19:18] <kuudes> and still when I mention my portable air scrubber, I presume it would again trigger "it can't work, you are idiot and superstitious kuudes!" among some aspiring rationalists
[04:19:53] <kuudes> idgi
[04:20:55] <kuudes> it felt to me like me using an extra tool against covid somehow felt threatening to other people
[04:23:53] <adiabatic> hm
[04:24:14] <adiabatic> like, bullshit measures are annoying and take energy from non-bullshit measures
[04:24:29] <saturn2> can you get some of that fine-powdered aspartame they use for mask fit tests to test your air scrubber?
[04:24:41] <nshepperd> well the 5 micron mistake is in all the textbooks
[04:24:47] <nshepperd> if i recall correctly
[04:25:10] <adiabatic> like, if you're thinking "do I use the phone with face ID and wear gloves or do I use the phone with touch ID and wear a mask", you don't want to worry about what you're touching
[04:25:26] <kuudes> saturn2, I don't do mask fit tests; perhaps I should. I have not heard of most any other layman do such either
[04:25:54] <adiabatic> can't you just have your kids or wife fart in your face and see if you smell it
[04:26:09] <saturn2> :|
[04:26:16] <kuudes> yes, it works when I am in a smoke or mold, I get less asthma symptoms
[04:26:42] <kuudes> I use it now at home when my neighbour has started to heat with a fireplace and our home is at times filled with smoke
[04:27:05] <adiabatic> burn your neighbor's house down and you'll have to smell the smoke only one more time
[04:27:08] <saturn2> ugh
[04:27:10] <kuudes> and it reduced my astma symptoms much when we had to open the door to the attic and did not know how to close it and bad air came in
[04:27:27] <kuudes> so yes, I believe it works as it says it works
[04:27:36] <kuudes> it has been certified by institution I trust
[04:27:52] <kuudes> the only open question is if that working as intended has effect on covid protection or not
[04:28:02] <kuudes> and indeed it may be it has not
[04:28:22] <kuudes> but I don't see why that still means it makes sense for people in chats to start to dogpile if I mention it
[04:28:23] <adiabatic> well, it's not the certification. it's also a matter of it fitting your face well enough even if you bend over and/or have a 5 o'clock shadow
[04:28:30] <kuudes> it is not a mask
[04:28:35] <kuudes> it is a portable air scrubber
[04:28:37] <adiabatic> oh, that
[04:28:52] <kuudes> it sucks the air in from front of you and blows purified air onto your face from down
[04:29:16] <kuudes> so hopefully, if there are lingering virus particles in residue air, it will at least dilute their concentration
[04:29:24] <kuudes> it does not replace a mask
[04:29:24] <adiabatic> hm, I'd have to look up how big mold spores are and how they compare to virus particles
[04:29:35] <kuudes> but I can use it while drinking a beer
[04:29:38] <kuudes> or eating a lunch
[04:29:49] <kuudes> and my presumption is that it is better than not having it
[04:30:22] <kuudes> and I don't understand why this should be a false presumption or a thing that warrants selfmade sceptics to try to score points on that this is clearly a bad thing somehow
[04:30:33] <kuudes> at worst, it blows air on my face.
[04:30:53] <kuudes> we already know it is good to be upwind from others re covid
[04:31:26] <kuudes> idgi
[04:31:38] <kuudes> it just feels somehow clearly dysrational way to act
[04:31:51] <kuudes> it woudl be different if I was marketing it against mask use
[04:31:54] <kuudes> but I am not
[04:31:59] <saturn2> which rationalists are dogpiling you for this?
[04:32:03] <adiabatic> ^
[04:32:08] <kuudes> it was on telegram less wrong group
[04:32:22] <rmmh> seems good
[04:32:23] <kuudes> and when I talked it on here back in freenode, someone jumped on me
[04:32:32] <rmmh> like a halfassed papr
[04:32:58] <adiabatic> I think there's a blue-tribe groupthink problem where they're worried that suboptimal anti-COVID protections crowd out known-good ones (getting a vax, masking up properly)
[04:33:02] <rmmh> I imagine if you visualized the airflow patterns it would greatly reduce aerosolized particles hitting you 
[04:33:15] <kuudes> yes
[04:33:40] <rmmh> adiabatic: probably the same dummies that believed the cdc when they said not to mask
[04:33:41] <kuudes> we have actually had somewhat lot of airflow research over here, but it seems to have got about completely sidestepped
[04:34:02] <rmmh> the west hates airflow research for stupid reasons 
[04:34:05] <adiabatic> rmmh: sounds about right. blue-tribe NPCs
[04:34:14] <kuudes> I have got a larger air scrubber for my wife to use at her office when she has mandatory near-work with customers
[04:34:17] <kuudes> she wears a ffp3
[04:34:22] <rmmh> Asia seems to understand it better, esp after the SARS apartment and so on
[04:34:27] <kuudes> but she takes it off when she has lunch in her office for example
[04:34:45] <adiabatic> can your wife open a window
[04:34:49] <kuudes> so the air scrubber hopefully reduces the amount of virus particles accruing from random customers who may wear bad masks
[04:34:54] <kuudes> we have winter here.
[04:34:55] <kuudes> no
[04:35:04] <adiabatic> can you crack a window
[04:35:11] <kuudes> windows on office buildings are usually unopenable
[04:35:16] <kuudes> there is hvac
[04:35:20] <saturn2> it seems like westerners took it seriously in airplanes, but no where else for some reason
[04:35:29] <kuudes> because on normal times people opening windows would screw hvac
[04:35:31] <adiabatic> well, it could be, like, a 100-year-old building with openable windows
[04:35:33] <kuudes> saturn2, yes
[04:35:43] <kuudes> we don't have 100 year old buildings here adiabatic generally
[04:35:53] <kuudes> this is not that part of europe that has those
[04:35:54] <adiabatic> sounds like california except for the weather
[04:36:05] <kuudes> this is the part of europe that was partly burned and bombed
[04:36:24] <kuudes> not as bad as more south though
[04:36:47] <rmmh> "I flew to Florida and it was fine but then I stayed in basement quarantine for 6 days when I got back. Don't tell my wife I enjoyed the time alone to catch up on final fantasy 14"
[04:36:57] <kuudes> XD
[04:37:06] <adiabatic> kek
[04:37:33] <kuudes> similarly back when the prevailing wisdom was "it is droplet based" no one seemed to duplicate my visor use
[04:37:46] <kuudes> instead everyone wants to use specifically bad masks or surgical masks
[04:37:55] <kuudes> no ffps, no visors, no air scrubbers
[04:38:32] <adiabatic> I'm still kind of shocked by how many presumably left-leaning hipsters still have bushy beards with a surgical or cloth mask on top
[04:38:46] <kuudes> yes, I shaved my beard when I started to wear a mask
[04:38:58] <adiabatic> granted, they're all in their 20s and not fat so they probably won't get wrecked
[04:39:00] <kuudes> because keeping a beard is idiotic if one believes one needs a mask
[04:39:13] <adiabatic> kuudes: jesus christ, I thought I was the only one
[04:39:22] <kuudes> I also shaved my hair
[04:39:27] <kuudes> well, to 9mm
[04:39:50] <kuudes> if it is airborne, it is airborne
[04:39:54] <adiabatic> I also shaved my head, but that was because getting a haircut wasn't a real option. then I started giving myself buzz cuts
[04:39:58] <kuudes> yes
[04:40:22] <saturn2> i even see people wearing an n95 on top of a huge bushy beard
[04:40:22] <kuudes> when I went to high risk places such as indoor covid test, I wore stuff I could put to wash immediately after
[04:40:25] <kuudes> yes
[04:40:27] <adiabatic> now I'm back to the hairdresser every four weeks like normal
[04:40:28] <kuudes> which is insane
[04:41:18] <kuudes> but indeed, I have specifically kept mum about me having a portable air scrubber in about everywhere since I got so much wannabe sceptic pointscorers on here and lesswrong telegram when I mentioned it
[04:41:28] <adiabatic> I remember leaving boxes out in the frontroom before we figured out that touch transmission wasn't much of a thing
[04:41:45] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: I mean, I see people walking around the street wearing masks below their nose. That's like, terminal nonsense
[04:41:53] <kuudes> I still wash or sterlize my hands everywhere
[04:42:06] <kuudes> well, I suppose it is better than no mask
[04:42:14] <kuudes> I mean, if we are in for reducing particles
[04:42:16] <rmmh> are you still not vaxxed
[04:42:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Like... there's no rule whatsoever forcing you to wear a mask on the street *at all*. None. So you *must* be wearing it because you have freely chosen to do so
[04:42:26] <kuudes> rmmh, who? me? I have three doses
[04:42:26] <Obormot\Gaia> But then... you don't cover your nose with it???
[04:42:29] <saturn2> Obormot\Gaia: insane
[04:42:34] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: meh. if you need to have it handy and don't want to put it totally off, and you need your phone to recognize your face, then that makes sense, assuming you're not staying by any one person for long
[04:42:55] <Obormot\Gaia> Why need to have it handy
[04:43:02] <Obormot\Gaia> These are people casually strolling
[04:43:08] <Obormot\Gaia> Not walking into or out of stores
[04:43:08] <kuudes> rmmh, all my dearest adults have now three doses
[04:43:15] <rmmh> Nice
[04:43:25] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: I don't always yank my mask off when I exit the grocery store because then it'll just dangle around my neck and that's not really an improvement when I'm bending down lots to put food in the back of the car
[04:43:26] <shawwwn> A mange in perspective is worth 80 rabies points
[04:43:27] <kuudes> because of this insanity that we are stopping to test for covid and let it spread
[04:43:43] <kuudes> I also have an oxygenerator at my home
[04:44:11] <kuudes> so I can give one person oxygen if I need, that should hopefully save all my dear ones
[04:44:18] * shawwwn is starting to think kuudes is a hypochondriac
[04:44:37] <adiabatic> shawwwn: seems like a boy scout to me
[04:44:43] <kuudes> sure. I just get some 15 colds per year
[04:45:05] <saturn2> he's immunocompromised iirc
[04:45:09] <adiabatic> ok, yeah, that pretty much totally explains it
[04:45:53] <shawwwn> Oh
[04:45:57] <kuudes> that economist javascript "what happens to you personally if you get covid" gave me per us data 13% chance to get hospitalized and 1% chance to die if infected while unvaccinated
[04:46:18] <shawwwn> You have a 1% chance to die? Lucky…
[04:46:20] <shawwwn> .rr
[04:46:21] <feepbot> shawwwn: Click. 
[04:47:12] <kuudes> but I presume now with three doses I might be sort of normal numbers, I hope
[04:47:27] <kuudes> but I plan to get fourth dose still in the week before christmas very likely somehow
[04:48:04] <kuudes> but indeed the lack of air scrubbers feels really odd to me
[04:48:15] <kuudes> and it is not even that they are hard to come by
[04:48:25] <kuudes> much of world's air scrubber production is in finland
[04:48:41] <kuudes> we made them even before the pandemic
[04:49:14] <kuudes> simple things, work with AC electricity. plug and forget
[04:49:51] <kuudes> microcovid gives them a factor of 1/5 which is comparable to everyone wearing ffp2
[04:50:21] <kuudes> so given the thing is very infective, we likely would get much out of those if we just spammed all shops and bars and whatnots with them
[04:51:11] <kuudes> meh

[05:54:51] <feepbot> Man On Internet Almost Falls Into World Of DIY Mustard Enthusiasts (DES MOINES, IA—When Steve Gibson first became casually involved with an online community of mustard makers, he had no idea his mild interest in the condiment would, within a few short months, spiral dangerously out of control.)
[05:55:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've considered making my own mustard
[05:55:56] <gwern> '"I saw my wife putting French's mustard on a bologna sandwich for our 5-year-old son, and I just lost control," Gibson said. "I said things—awful things that I'm not proud of—and the two of them were clearly shaken. I can never take those words back. When I looked in the mirror and barely recognized that livid face staring back at me, I finally understood that these mustard people...
[05:56:02] <gwern> ...weren't really my friends."'
[05:56:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It sounds fairly easy
[05:56:12] <gwern> 'When a MustardMonster member who was "deep into the lifestyle" suggested Gibson till up his yard to grow his own mustard plants, the 41-year-old didn't even balk at the idea. By this point, Gibson said, mustard had become his only reason for getting out of bed in the morning.'
[05:56:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It was there that he first learned about mustard's use in various folk remedies: how to relieve chest congestion by making a plaster from the condiment" ... I'm pretty sure this is still a pretty standard thing in Russia...
[05:59:38] <catern> mustard doesn't even taste good
[05:59:45] <gwern> you shut your whore mouth
[06:00:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[06:00:22] <catern> they hated him because he told them the truth
[06:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, from that Serious Eats review:
[06:01:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "_Space Jam: A New Legacy_ is not good. Compared to its predecessor, which is at least watchable, it has worse writing, worse acting, and worse visuals. It's a pure I.P. grab, a cynical product of studio plotting that's even more cynical than most modern Hollywood blockbusters,
[06:01:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Naturally, a new _Space Jam_ movie has a new _Space Jam_-themed cereal. And, like its namesake, the cereal is bad. However, it's not as bad, relatively speaking, as the movie. "
[06:01:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The single biggest problem with this cereal is it doesn't taste like anything. The writing on the box says, “Berry With Marshmallows,” but there's no berry flavor—not even the generic berry flavor that you get in most breakfast cereals—and there are barely any marshmallows."
[06:01:26] <catern> it's a placebo taste
[06:01:47] <gwern> now, you want bad hot takes on food - my aunt was deeply offended when she said 'we have a rule in our house, to never eat candy corn before october first' and I replied 'and in mine, to never eat it after october first as well'
[06:02:08] <catern> apparently this reviewer ignored the clear marking on the box "For Placebo Responders Only"

[06:03:14] <gwern> yeah. it's one of the premier examples of a candy/food/dessert which exists solely because of tradition and a holiday. candy corn wouldn't last an instant if it had to compete on the mere plane of taste
[06:03:23] <gwern> I'd rather eat turkish delight imo

[06:04:13] <adiabatic> that's why I asked
[06:04:19] <catern> are you implying turkish delight is not good and also exists solely because of tradition? surely not - I mean, it's weird and overpoweringly sweet, but sugar tastes good y'know

[06:24:44] <PapuaHardyNet> looks like the stuff video game protagonists wear tbh
[06:25:32] <gwern> https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2395/8271/products/JACKETRESOURCEM-3_1500x.jpg?v=1625138785 when you want to look like you're a video game cosplay without the inconvenient questions about which one
[06:26:01] <catern> this one is pretty cool https://www.demobaza.com/collections/aw21-1/products/top-coat-oneness-w?variant=40070268682437
[06:26:12] <feepbot> TOP COAT ONENESS W – DEMOBAZA (detailed smooth neoprene asymmetric high collar coat)
[06:26:41] <catern> when social justice advances to forcing men to wear dresses to prove they are in touch with their feminine side, I'll wear that
[06:27:38] <adiabatic> not me, it's too warm to wear something that puffy
[06:27:58] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: you'll look badass instead of feminine
[06:28:12] <catern> it's called malicious compliance, heard of it
[06:28:23] <PapuaHardyNet> first time
[06:28:29] <adiabatic> birthday suits are unisex, I'll wear that
[06:29:25] <PapuaHardyNet> and you'll be sued for public exposure
[06:29:42] <adiabatic> not if I'm on zoom calls all day and leave the camera off
[06:29:58] <adiabatic> what I want to know is to know what kind of work goes into these: https://www.demobaza.com/collections/ninja-masks
[06:30:09] <feepbot> NINJA HATS – DEMOBAZA
[06:30:13] <catern> oh shit
[06:30:20] <catern> this is what I was talking about a week or so ago
[06:30:40] <PapuaHardyNet> https://www.demobaza.com/collections/aw21/products/no-sleeve-varnish?variant=40057089065157
[06:30:44] <PapuaHardyNet> final fantasy ???
[06:30:51] <feepbot> NO SLEEVE VARNISH – DEMOBAZA (heavy knitted ribbed high collar waxed wool vest)
[06:30:58] <catern> >all this talk about how boring modern clothes are makes me want to wear some fancy clothes
[06:31:04] <catern> >but what ostentatious clothing even is there?
[06:31:36] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: Cid: https://www.demobaza.com/products/gloves-rib-vega-m
[06:31:48] <feepbot> GLOVES RIB VEGA M – DEMOBAZA (man rib cozy finger gloves)
[06:31:52] <catern> my wish has been granted, now I am tested to see whether I will keep my word
[06:32:00] <gwern> you could start out with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zentai
[06:32:11] <feepbot> A zentai suit (from Japanese  ゼンタイ zentai) is a skin-tight garment that covers the entire body. The word is a portmanteau of zenshin taitsu (Japanese: 全身タイツ, lit. 'full-body tights').
[06:32:18] <gwern> the good thing is they hide your face so you can experiment without worry about it following you forever
[06:32:20] <catern> zentai is exactly the opposite of fancy/ostentatious!
[06:32:28] <gwern> what? it's super fancy and ostentatious
[06:32:38] <gwern> put on one and go out in public and see if people don't stare
[06:32:38] <adiabatic> I can't tell if these are all drop-crotch or if they're just wearing their pants low: https://www.demobaza.com/collections/shorts-demoman
[06:32:48] <catern> gwern: this was in the context of the ACX post about how modernist art is obsessed with making things super simple and streamlined
[06:32:50] <feepbot> SHORTS – DEMOBAZA
[06:32:52] <adiabatic> gwern: the trick is wearing them in places where people _don't_ stare
[06:32:53] <catern> and how that applies to modern fashion too
[06:33:03] <gwern> zentai is *so* fancy that I bet there's not a single store in your town that sells them
[06:33:14] <catern> gwern: zentai is like the ultimate in modernist fashion, in this sense
[06:33:18] <PapuaHardyNet> of course, women don't wear it low, only the male model does
[06:33:25] <gwern> catern: but you can make it arbitrarily decorated and colored
[06:33:55] <catern> if there's a zentai suit which has some kind of complicated artistic print on that, yes, that might qualify
[06:34:02] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphsuits look even WP agrees: "Industry: fancy dress"
[06:34:02] <catern> but that's obviously a non-standard zentai suit
[06:34:03] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, it is a "drop-crotch" as you put it, the crotch part sometimes reaches the knees
[06:34:10] <gwern> catern: of course!
[06:34:13] <feepbot> Morphsuits is a company in Edinburgh, Scotland. It distributes branded spandex costumes, based on the existing skin-tight garments, which cover the entire body.
[06:34:19] <gwern> that's the whole point! fancy clothes are non-standard
[06:34:27] <gwern> if you're buying standard, then you're a lamer, in every era
[06:34:30] <PapuaHardyNet> how can you even run with such pants?
[06:34:38] <gwern> 'As of May 2011, it claimed to be the world's largest fancy dress brand.[16]'
[06:34:47] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: same way you run in stiletto heels. you take them off first
[06:34:51] <PapuaHardyNet> hot
[06:35:20] * gwern concludes that demobaza is just 'Naruto: The Clothing Store'
[06:35:55] <adiabatic> decent video-game-villain vibes: https://www.demobaza.com/collections/robes-1/products/robe-merkaba-1
[06:36:06] <feepbot> ROBE MERKABA – DEMOBAZA (highly detailed reconstructedelastic denim high collar robewrap closing by buttonszipped pocketsvintage washed effect)
[06:36:24] <adiabatic> what I want to know is why they went for a bunch of bow-legged pigeon-toed models
[06:36:39] <gwern> they're pigeon-toed from the arms-back running
[06:37:32] <PapuaHardyNet> gonna wear this to my graduation ceremony: https://www.demobaza.com/products/semi-overall-cabin?variant=37710145487045
[06:37:43] <feepbot> SEMI OVERALL CABIN – DEMOBAZA (detailed elastic denim semi overallremovable upper partzipped pockets, elastic beltvintage washed effect)
[06:37:54] <adiabatic> wear https://www.demobaza.com/collections/robes-1/products/shawl-blanket-nomad in SF and see who gives you a thumbs-up knowingly and who gives you a buck to get back on your feet or at least into a homeless shelter: https://www.demobaza.com/collections/robes-1/products/shawl-blanket-nomad
[06:38:00] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:38:05] <feepbot> SHAWL BLANKET NOMAD – DEMOBAZA (soft touch re-constructed blanket shawl with hoody and laces, raw, super trashy look, closing by wrapping)
[06:38:06] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: ninja graduation, right? right?
[06:38:08] <adiabatic> er, sorry for posting the same link twice. I have the memory of a mayfly
[06:38:26] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, I'll finally become a chuunin
[06:38:55] <catern> with drip like this you'll be the next hokage
[06:39:09] <adiabatic> what do you even put in an elbow cabin: https://www.demobaza.com/products/elbow-cabin-1
[06:39:21] <feepbot> ELBOW CABIN – DEMOBAZA (detailed elastic denim neoprene elbowzipped  pocketvintage washed effect)
[06:39:24] <adiabatic> AirPods case?
[06:39:46] <PapuaHardyNet> contraceptives, b/c of all the girls wanting to jump you
[06:39:48] <catern> adiabatic: i know this one! it's for storing ammo in the postapocalypse
[06:40:16] <adiabatic> catern: c'mon now, ggreer isn't around so I'm going to have to sneer at you on his behalf
[06:41:10] <PapuaHardyNet> but seriously, this is something you can probably wear outside, if you leave out the cap, the glasses, and the gloves: https://www.demobaza.com/products/top-protestor-m?variant=37709245055173
[06:41:21] <feepbot> TOP PROTESTOR M – DEMOBAZA (detailed elastic net no sleeve topsoft comfortable touchvintage washed effect)
[06:41:40] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: not here, I live in normieville
[06:42:41] <adiabatic> https://www.demobaza.com/collections/robes-1/products/big-cloth-purity-black-1 doubles as a $550 beach towel when you're not Black Maging it up
[06:42:42] <catern> adiabatic: it's https://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com/bandolier_wrist
[06:42:47] <catern> well, moved up a bit I guess
[06:42:52] <feepbot> BIG CLOTH PURITY BLACK – DEMOBAZA (DEMOBAZA deconstructive long detailedhooded bath towel blanketzipped pockets)
[06:42:54] <feepbot> Wrist bandolier has a volume of 0.25 and a weight of 0.07. It does 0 bashing damage and 0 cutting damage. You can find more information here.
[06:43:12] <PapuaHardyNet> wut, that was a serious description?
[06:43:25] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, it was the description of the chezzo link
[06:49:33] <gwern> I think the worst part of 'elbow cabin' is that it's *only* that little pouch
[06:49:38] <gwern> like $100 for that
[06:53:36] <adiabatic> this would work well in a world with Adam Jensen's ACR-designed jacket: https://www.demobaza.com/collections/overcoats-demoman/products/topcoat-metatron?variant=1523018989598
[06:53:47] <feepbot> TOPCOAT METATRON – DEMOBAZA (re-constructed formal asymetric overcoat, high collar with snap fastening, closing by buttoms)
[06:56:13] <gwern> looks very low poly
[06:56:22] <adiabatic> very true
[06:56:43] <adiabatic> it's very simple, like a TNG-give-or-take Star Trek uniform
[07:00:41] <adiabatic> imagine sitting down in your car to drive to work and your zippers on https://www.demobaza.com/collections/overalls-demoman/products/overall-gyan-m?variant=31485890035808 shred your seats
[07:00:53] <feepbot> OVERALL GYAN M – DEMOBAZA (detailed hooded short combat overallmulti zipped pocketsroll up sleevesclosing by zipper)
[07:03:36] <gwern> it's just as well. if you tried to walk, everyone would stare at how the low cut makes you look like you're a duck waddling
[07:03:47] <catern> uh, where are you going to get the gasoline for that car in the postapocalypse? it's all going to be denatured after the first 5 years
[07:03:48] <catern> be realistic
[07:04:38] <gwern> biofuel
[07:04:51] <PapuaHardyNet> what does that even mean
[07:05:00] <gwern> and maybe you can ferment the bodies of your enemies into more fuel to power your conquests
[07:05:22] <adiabatic> hmmmmmm, I saw Jack Dorsey in some Rick Owens drop-crotch cargo shorts and he was mid-stride and it didn't look wrong
[07:05:33] <adiabatic> but this was just a picture, not a movie or IRL

[09:37:42] <PapuaHardyNet> CoJaBo: is this the same spam detector?
[09:37:57] <CoJaBo_> Yes :/
[09:40:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You know I'm hardly a Facebook defender but it doesn't seem like the link to "Facebook bans this but not that" is very strong
[09:41:29] <CoJaBo_> Antivaxxers who get COVID should indeed avoid the ICU.

[09:42:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, it doesn't help that the treatments we have for people who get seriously ill with COVID actually mostly don't work
[09:42:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like the survival rate is horrifyingly low
[09:45:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously the right conclusion to draw from this is "get the vaccine, you idiot", but... if you start with a premise of "vaccine doesn't work and/or is harmful" and then observe "people who get serious cases go into ICUs and mostly don't come out alive", and you have not learned the skill of thinking "if the situation is actually unsolvably terrible, then I desire to believe that the situation is actually unsolvably terrible".
[09:45:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> ..
[09:45:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... then "there must be better treatments, they're just not telling us about them" *is* the natural next step
[09:47:08] <CoJaBo_> One of the HCA award recipients the other day was particularly hilarious
[09:47:32] <CoJaBo_> Praying for a miracle cure. Rejecting the miracle cure. Dying of the virus.
[09:47:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again, part of the problem is that our health/medical experts are extremely reluctant to say things like "the treatments that we use in case of <whatever> are mostly completely ineffective and probably won't help you and you will probably die after suffering a lot and we have no idea how to improve that situation"
[09:48:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even if that is (a) actually the reality, (b) not at all their (the experts') fault
[09:48:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> This reluctance makes the actual outcomes look like evidence of some sort of malfeasance or something
[09:50:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, of course, just in general, saying "we don't have a solution, but trust us - neither does anyone else" is almost never going to be persuasive)
[09:53:27] <CoJaBo_> Natural selection will eventually solve this problem.
[09:53:31] <PapuaHardyNet> hopefully
[09:54:08] <saturn2> i guess the real doctors have to claim their treatments are effective, since the people selling hydrogen peroxide inhalers are definitely going to

[10:08:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> In any case the sins of the father merely constitute suffering for the sins of the grandfather
[10:09:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Original sin is just heritability of personality traits
[10:10:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, because they will suffer, therefore you desire to believe that which will occur and not shy away from reality (litany of tarski if I remember correctly)

[19:06:35] <MrFantastik> i could replace them with better feet
[19:06:38] <TheWhisper> My own feet? 13,000,000 USD
[19:06:58] <MrFantastik> but only one would be uneven
[19:07:08] <feep> shawwwn: best answer I can give you with limited thought is somewhere between 300k and 150k
[19:07:18] <kuudes> wow, thats cheap
[19:07:36] <kuudes> government might actually be able to buy a foot from you for someone else
[19:07:38] <feep> kuudes: that gets me to leanFIRE levels, so what we're actually asking is "foot vs like eight years of lifetime"

[19:08:29] <MrFantastik> I imagine if i had those only on my feet 
[19:08:36] <MrFantastik> i'd be pretty fast
[19:08:46] <MrFantastik> also 8 feet tall
[19:08:48] <kuudes> fire seems on average lower reliability than pension system insurance here
[19:08:57] <shawwwn> I guess $300k is a decent price for a foot
[19:09:03] <kuudes> because rarely people actually protect their own capital against themselves
[19:09:19] <feep> kuudes: yes we know you live in competentstan
[19:09:20] <MrFantastik> wdym by that
[19:09:30] <feep> approximately nobody my age in germany expects to get meaningful rent :P
[19:09:33] <MrFantastik> protect capital from oneself
[19:09:40] <kuudes> fire people are still liable for stuff like their child having to get brain surgery or dying
[19:09:48] <feep> joke's on you I'm unmarried
[19:09:49] <kuudes> and they can then cash out their pension capital if they control it
[19:10:00] <kuudes> in pension system you can't
[19:10:08] <kuudes> so your child will die, but you will get pension
[19:10:16] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what, we should be able to mortgage our useable organs
[19:10:18] <feep> but yes, iff you could like ... have access to a sensible pension system
[19:10:48] <feep> hm tho otoh fire is still better because it's on your schedule
[19:11:09] <feep> if you could literally buy monthly income for the rest of your life
[19:11:10] <kuudes> feep, yes, which is why I have made some effort to try to find out if I could hire friends from abroad over internet so that I would have to pay for their pension payments and they would therefore become eligible to pension from finland
[19:11:13] <feep> that'd be optimal
[19:11:13] <nshepperd2> yes, the early part is rather essentiate to FIRE
[19:11:27] <kuudes> nshepperd2, yes
[19:11:35] <nshepperd2> the whole point is not be a slave of the system until 65

[19:11:59] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, what - you want to hire people, so you have to pay their pension, so you become eligible for pension?
[19:11:59] <kuudes> yes. otoh over here you get stuff out of the pension system before 65
[19:12:06] <feep> shawwwn: yes

[19:28:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I find it rather pathetic when white people write about how it is a good thing for affirmative action to be aggressively biased towards minorities. Keep in mind I'm not white.
[19:28:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not even saying affirmative action is wrong - it just seems stupid - it is literally a power play, and you are voluntarily giving away political power.
[19:29:26] <PapuaHardyNet> to clarify: I'm not saying affirmative action is stupid - I mean the actions of such white people is stupid
[19:30:16] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps some people are playing 4D chess and sticking to the party line while actually making power plays for their benefit privately? that would make more sense

[21:55:26] <feep> so there was a bit where I was fighting these three guys, and I shot one, dropped my gun cause it was out, at that point the second grabbed my gun, reloaded it, pointed it at me, and I immediately went into a disarm move
[21:55:57] <feep> as part of the disarm move you sweep the gun through the point where the enemy's head is on the ground, so I just grabbed my gun back, shot him in mid-move, and shot the third.
[21:56:11] <feep> then I paused the game and just sat there like ":D!!!!" for a full minute
[21:56:27] <feep> it was the smoothest piece of combat that has ever happened to me in a videogame

[21:57:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Yes, I love that about the Oni combat system
[21:57:24] <feep> also the final boss is a letdown though, come on, at least give him a second phase or sth
[21:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> eh

[21:57:59] <feep> extradimensional space magic can explain basically anything
[21:58:32] <feep> also the german translation of the game had one of the worst missteps I've ever seen lol
[21:59:01] <feep> you --- okay, the non-americans here, do you know that thing where you hear something when playing a game as a kid that makes no sense
[21:59:25] <feep> and later on you learn english and at one point it just clicks and you go "OH, THAT'S WHY THE POKEMON MOVE IS CALLED PFUND"
[21:59:43] <feep> "because the translation was done by a blind idiot and they used the noun form of pound instead of the verb"
[22:00:16] <gwern> I think the most striking thing about this chinese power thing is how... self-inflicted? it seems
[22:00:37] <feep> anyway, oni has the wonderful time where your dream alter ego calls you a "TCTF farmer"
[22:00:54] <feep> and ... it took me a while to figure out that this was a chess metaphor that got destroyed in a very bad translation
[22:01:09] <feep> (the "pawn" piece is called "farmer" in german chess)
[22:01:15] <rsaarelm> Hah.
[22:01:43] <rsaarelm> Pfund = pound sterling?
[22:01:46] <feep> yep
[22:01:48] <rsaarelm> Nice.

[22:01:51] <gwern> do pawn and peasant come frmo the same roots?
[22:01:53] <feep> for a few years, I was very confused though, I think it only clicked when I played the english version
[22:02:21] <rsaarelm> I think the translators are given like just contextless snippets to work with.
[22:02:37] <feep> gwern: wiktionary says no
[22:02:55] <gwern> rsaarelm: or used crude '90s machine translation for the first pass
[22:02:57] <feep> pawn comes from peon
[22:03:19] <feep> rsaarelm: I think in oni's case it was just a genuinely bad translation.
[22:03:31] <feep> like, the translator couldn't think of a better phrasing
[22:03:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ah yes, STALKER has one of those
[22:03:41] <rsaarelm> I put on Finnish subtitles in Horizon Zero Dawn and it was surprisingly good for the initial intro narration, took five minutes until the first obviously unidiomatic translation and until I hit the first machine puzzle where it was hopeless.

[22:03:55] * gwern notes 'Pandora papers' is bad branding because it sounds so much like 'Panama papers'
[22:04:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a weapon which is translated as "SGI-5k 'Arrow'"
[22:04:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why? In Russian - transliterated - it's "SGI-5k Strelka"
[22:04:45] <gwern> (oh, and there was a 'Paradise Papers' too, which of course you don't remember because this is way too much alliteration)
[22:04:46] <rsaarelm> I don't remember what was involved in the HZD puzzle exactly, but technical vocabulary is tricky to translate and I basically had no idea how the Finnish text corresponded to anything in the game world.
[22:04:46] <feep> I can't remember if that gun was good or not
[22:05:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, "strelka" does mean "arrow" (actually, it means "arrow" as in the symbol; it's the diminutive of "strela", which is the word for "arrow" as in the projectile)
[22:05:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[22:05:46] <feep> all I remember is that the trs-301 was the best
[22:05:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> In this context it's a ... homonym? of the actual word, which is "Strelka", i.e., the possessive form of "Strelok"
[22:05:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. it SHOULD be "Strelok's SGI-5k"
[22:06:00] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: ... LOL
[22:06:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course this is not a coincidence, because "Strelok" means "archer" in the first place)

[22:07:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah they updated it at some point I think
[22:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, no, the weapon is not that amazing (it's good but not standout good; I did use it for a little while though)
[22:07:49] <feep> yeah it's a transitory gun I think

[22:09:24] <feep> well hang on though, best, sure
[22:09:43] <feep> but I think all of those fall into a vague cluster of "'second half of the game' weapons"
[22:10:22] <feep> that as opposed to the akms and the pistols and the shitty viper, *actually feel good to use*.
[22:10:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok well the best first-half-of-game weapon is the Fast-Shooting AK (in SoC) or the Abakan (in CoP)
[22:11:21] <feep> okay, but ignoring specials
[22:11:28] <feep> I would actually put the viper on top?
[22:11:58] <feep> ammo was fairly plentiful and even though it didn't have much stopping power it at least felt like shots went where I put them.
[22:12:33] <feep> all the "second half" guns have the pleasant property that you can fairly reliably produce headshots with them
[22:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Abakan is not a special, technically
[22:12:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for headshots, you use a sniper rifle for those
[22:12:53] <feep> oh I'm just co--- no, what
[22:12:57] <feep> you *always* want headshots
[22:13:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, you always want headshots, but if you're in a position to *reliably* go for headshots, take out your sniper rifle
[22:13:26] <feep> I feel that's a core part of why the enemies never felt like bullet sponges for me
[22:13:38] <feep> idk, I don't think I ever carried a dedi sniper
[22:13:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> whaaaaat

[22:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> But sniper rifles are like the most fun part of the game!!!

[22:15:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Huh? Ammo's plentiful
[22:15:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I never had a problem getting ammo for that thing
[22:15:42] <feep> sniper ammo..? I never had that impression
[22:15:51] <feep> I saw maybe one mag per level
[22:15:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[22:16:08] <feep> well I mean ~none of the enemies use it
[22:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> First of all, the Vintar uses standard 9x39
[22:16:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's one of the things that makes it so awesome
[22:16:52] <feep> at least with 5.56 you can sometimes find it
[22:17:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you load up on the 9x39mm AP stuff and you're g2g
[22:17:17] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, I was thinking of 7.62
[22:17:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, of course

[23:38:19] <shawwwn> All they had to do was ignore robots.txt
[23:38:20] <shawwwn> But no
[23:38:31] <saturn2> if EA continues growing as a % of all charity i predict there will be EA art museums as soon as museums start having trouble fundraising from non-EA sources

[23:39:09] <catern> saturn2: you can predict that on the basis of cynicism but I don't think "they fund EA propaganda today" is evidence of that
[23:39:20] <saturn2> yes
[23:41:48] <saturn2> though utilitarianism may have altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human
[23:42:54] <kuudes> shawwwn, you don't know they don't *preserve* things behind robots.txt. they just don't *show* things behind robots.txt
[23:43:21] <kuudes> they should indeed try to avoid lawsuits to be able to preserve more
[23:43:38] <kuudes> and their preservations are more protected than if they show something
[23:43:40] <shawwwn> We also don’t know that EA doesn’t do cat pictures, even though all they do is CLIP images

[23:48:52] <feepbot> <gwern> https://equusmagazine.com/news/arko-clone-born
[23:48:52] <feepbot> Clone of famous show-jumping stallion Arko born - The Horse Owner's Resource (The clone was generated from a small skin sample taken from Arko and genetically preserved by UK-based genetic preservation company, Gemini Genetics.)
[23:50:03] <shawwwn> Sigh
[23:50:09] <shawwwn> I guess I should do some actual work today
[23:50:58] <shawwwn> I got annoyed on Wednesday when Routable told me to make https://github.com/shawwn/pysigning private
[23:51:10] <feepbot> GitHub - shawwn/pysigning: Python library and CLI scripts for signing and verifying data - GitHub - shawwn/pysigning: Python library and CLI scripts for signing and verifying data
[23:51:23] <shawwwn> I pointed out it was basically like a library that computes SHA1
[23:51:48] <shawwwn> I.e. no reason to keep it private, and it makes it easier to write software in a modular way
[23:52:11] <shawwwn> They were like “I don’t care if it’s console.log(“hello world”), Routable owns the IP”
[23:52:17] <shawwwn> I was like OHO
[23:52:20] <shawwwn> I see
[23:52:43] <gwern> sounds like they believe in security by obscurity. if they cared about security, the IP ownership wouldn't make a lick of difference
[23:52:50] <shawwwn> Lovely fellows
[23:53:21] <shawwwn> Nah, it’s not even about security. Just power
[23:53:56] <shawwwn> It took a great deal of restraint not to tell them exactly what I thought of their policies. But, being a money slave does have its benefits
[23:54:00] <shawwwn> Such as money
[23:55:47] <saturn2> but it isn't private
[23:55:48] <catern> RiversHaveWings: charlie stross continuing to be lame - what happened to him to suck out his brains and make him so joyless and opposed to everything he wrote in accelerandO?
[23:56:45] <catern> shawwwn: did you actually mention it willingly to your employer?
[23:57:00] <catern> my strategy is to get one open source project approved and then claim that everything I do is part of that
