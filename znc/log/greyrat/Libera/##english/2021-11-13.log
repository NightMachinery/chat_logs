[00:13:18] <mdogg> bbbbb－ I can't stand memes at all.
[00:13:39] * blkshp enjoys a good meme
[00:15:12] <blkshp> bbbbb, weren't you just 4 b's before?!
[00:16:08] <bbbbb> haha yes, but I forgot my password and email account that I used to register, so I had to set it up again
[00:16:33] <mdogg> Regarding the "should've" statement - I can see how that might *sound* like 'should-of' but it is "should have".   
[00:17:14] <mdogg> And blkshp is a native English speaker.
[00:17:44] <blkshp> bbbbb: I've been racking my brain about what was wrong lol!
[00:20:18] <bbbbb> It's a reflection on my ability to spell :p
[00:20:29] <blkshp> xD
[00:22:09] <bbbbb> Oh I didn't realise blkshp was a native English speaker, for some reason I thought s/he was just a master of it as a second language
[00:23:37] <blkshp> I'm English from England! :D
[00:25:16] <bbbbb> but...you know grammar and good words and stuff...
[00:25:42] <blkshp> I'm and Englishman from England that likes language!
[00:26:09] <blkshp> I'm definitely not perfect at it because I haven't studied it properly in any detail, something that second language learners do.
[00:26:31] <blkshp> This is why often a lot of learners know more about what the technicalities are than native speakers.
[00:26:38] <blkshp> We know what sounds right, not why!
[00:27:32] <bbbbb> yeah! I've actually learned a lot about my own language here.
[00:28:01] <blkshp> Me too :)
[00:29:00] <bbbbb> I once took the English language test that's given to university students. I found it really hard!
[00:30:23] <blkshp> I might have to have a go too. Perhaps an ESL test to see how good I am!

[00:44:48] <blkshp> No, the name blkshp is owned by a clothing company. I'm happy to let them have it (until they're not happy for me to be here using it and then they'll have a fight on their hands.

[00:51:53] <blkshp> Well looking through the questions that i got "wrong" they're perfectly correct colloquially. Like i used "before" it wanted "beforehand"
[00:52:10] <blkshp> I used "opposing" it wanted "against"

[00:53:27] <blkshp> I screwed one up for real...
[00:53:47] <blkshp> "He has seen a hundred Euro note on..." should have been "He saw a hundred Euro..."
[00:54:01] <blkshp> Other than that correct.
[00:56:20] <bbbbb> 'He has seen' could be correct
[00:56:48] <blkshp> The next sentence continued in the past tense.

[00:57:19] <blkshp> he had seen ... would have just about worked but yes, he saw. I was just trying to be cocky and do it in 3 minutes flat.
[00:57:36] <mdogg> "He has seen a hundred Euro note before."  would be fine.  But "He saw a hundred Euro note late July." would be correct.
[00:57:51] <mdogg> late = last
[00:58:01] <blkshp> id still say that should be "had"
[00:58:12] <mdogg> Had seen?
[00:58:27] <blkshp> he had seen a hundred € note before.
[00:58:34] <mdogg> Oh, no way bro.
[00:58:44] <blkshp> ...bro? :P
[00:58:48] <mdogg> Sorry.. lol
[00:58:51] <mdogg> Brother.

[00:59:48] <mdogg> Well, I do kind of think of you as my language brother on the other side of the pond.  We both have a similar passion about the language and enjoy helping people as much as we can.
[01:00:07] <blkshp> There's a film I can't remember when someone gets called "bro" and turns around and sarcastically says "Bro" as if he's stabbed him
[01:00:23] <blkshp> I don't really have an issue with being called "bro" :D
[01:00:31] <mdogg> Oh ok..
[01:00:34] <blkshp> It's just not regularly heard here
[01:00:53] <mdogg> We use "bro" and "brother" quite a bit.  
[01:00:55] <blkshp> "dude", i still hear that a lot
[01:01:07] <blkshp> mainly from my friends!
[01:01:08] <mdogg> Americans sound like imbeciles when we say "mate".
[01:01:18] <blkshp> xD
[01:01:24] <bbbbb> OK so this is an instance where I know 'he has seen' and 'he had seen' indicate slightly different things, but I don't know why
[01:01:24] <blkshp> yes :)
[01:02:02] <blkshp> hmmm. my explanation for this is about to prove me wrong.
[01:02:20] <blkshp> You can't really unsee something so you have always seen it.
[01:02:32] <blkshp> "so he has seen a policeman.""
[01:02:51] <blkshp> 20 years later he has still seen it.
[01:03:17] <mdogg> Makes sense.
[01:03:24] <mdogg> That's a good way of looking at it I think.
[01:03:47] <blkshp> Like I said, not an English scholar so not 100%
[01:04:18] <mdogg> "He has killed a spider before."  
[01:04:43] <bbbbb> 'had seen' seem to indicate something that's related to something in the present
[01:04:47] <blkshp> s/ before//
[01:04:48] <chat> blkshp thinks mdogg meant to say: "He has killed a spider."  
[01:05:01] <blkshp> same thing with one less word :D
[01:05:09] <mdogg> Correct.
[01:07:28] <bbbbb> he had seen the instructions, but couldn't recall them when he needed to use them
[01:07:38] <mdogg> I can't stand it when people add "all over again" when speaking about déjà vu.  Some people say, "It's déjà vu all over again" which is redundant. 
[01:08:42] <LuisP18> where might such test be located?

[19:00:46] <Fohsap_> Yeah.  That makes sense.  You don't want two main verbs so 'would have had + verb' should be incorrect.
[19:02:23] <Fohsap_> If you had been in college.  If you would have been in college.  If you would have had been in college.

[19:38:21] <lpapp> hi, what is the opposite of advance? E.g. in programming, I advance an index of an array, but at the same time I would like to decrease another index coming back from the back of the array.
[19:38:39] <lpapp> I could use increase and decrease, but advancing an index is a common term in programming, so wondering what the opposite would be.

[19:54:40] <Fohsap_> But I mean, I guess you could use any of them.
[19:55:04] <Fohsap_> maybe pull back
[19:55:29] <LuisP14> quite an amount of antonyms in existence
[19:55:35] <Fohsap_> or backtrace
[19:55:58] <LuisP14> backtrack
[19:56:02] <Fohsap_> retrocede, backpedal... 
[19:56:44] <Fohsap_> dude, you could say retrocede with a red leather jacket.
[19:57:27] <Fohsap_> hey, LuisP14, do you sell your writing?
[19:58:04] <LuisP14> regress, retrogress, retrograde
[19:58:05] <LuisP14> ?
[19:59:48] <LuisP14> rewind
[20:00:36] <lpapp> the interesting thing is that increase and decrease are more evident :)
[20:01:13] <LuisP14> and forward backward
[20:01:23] <lpapp> yep
[20:02:29] <LuisP14> procede re[tro]cede
[20:04:34] <LuisP14> so aggressive ... must be regressive :>
[20:08:43] <lpapp> :)
[20:08:55] <lpapp> yes, recede sounds like the opposite of procede
[20:09:12] <lpapp> I was thinking of regress myself.
[20:09:37] <lpapp> like we say for bugs that there is a regression in the software
[20:09:39] <lpapp> otherwise advancement.
[20:11:08] <LuisP14> it's all so ..congressive.. lol

[21:59:10] <blackfield> hello, do you have a verb for getting (oneself) somewhere, but being implicitly clear it/one is lost.. in sentences this could be 'where did my hat *go*?' or 'where should i *depart/get myself to*?' (neither go, or get to seems to me like the subject is lost though)

[22:23:32] <dTal> I don't follow the hat example
[22:23:54] <dTal> "where did my hat go" is perfectly idiomatic to say when you've misplaced your hat

[22:24:43] <dTal> I mean if you're asking "where did my hat go" then the hat is clearly lost

[22:44:41] <blackfield> i suppose i'd like the verb itself to imply (the subject) being lost, not through the sentence structure.. for example 'get lost' does so, but rather explicitly :D you could ask 'whither could i ever go?' as in you have no place to go, but the word 'go' implies just motion, nothing else.. i was only curious if there is some such english word, if not i won't be surprised
[22:50:50] <dTal> they're pretty separate things to want to unify
[22:51:32] <dTal> you can want instructions without being unsure of where you are, and you can request information on where you are without needing to go anywhere in particular

[22:52:17] *** Joins: iroha (~iroha@user/iroha)
[22:52:37] <dTal> and what's more, after you've been given the instructions and are in the process of "going", you are no longer lost
[22:52:54] <dTal> so the verb that means "going" can't carry lost-ness with it

[23:02:27] <blackfield> i guess so :) translating poetry to english is so unsatisfying.. (i suppose if someone said 'get lost', they could just as well say 'disappear'.. and the word can mean lost in that way, where did the hat disappear to? where can i disappear to? those sound awful of course but carry the meaning somewhat :D
[23:02:36] <blackfield> in any case thank you for trying to help :))
