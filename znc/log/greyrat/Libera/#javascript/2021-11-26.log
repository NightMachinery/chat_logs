[07:12:37] <EdFletcher> whatsupdoc: yeah, node is a javascript runtime specifically for _outside_ the browser. there's no use of it within the browser, which already has a built-in JS runtime.
[07:12:58] <whatsupdoc> i wanted to use libraries from node
[07:15:00] <EdFletcher> whatsupdoc: ah yeah then you'll need a bundler like webpack

[07:17:29] <ljharb> whatsupdoc: yes, webpack or another bundler.
[07:17:34] <ljharb> whatsupdoc: it's required for modern web dev.
[07:18:25] <whatsupdoc> why isn't this just built into javascript? are there security concerns or something?
[07:21:34] <tempest> historical reasons mostly
[07:22:00] <tempest> also yes some security constraints about loading things cross origin

[14:06:15] <austincheney> the problem is that you need a map of timezone offsets to geographies
[14:06:38] * austincheney hates timezones as completely unnecessary
[14:06:56] <austincheney> india and china get timezones right
[14:07:21] <D4mned> how so ?
[14:08:18] <OnkelBlade> austincheney: yeah, and I wouldn't want to keep that array and do the browser's job
[14:08:25] <ashnur> sylario, probably better if you reproduce it in something like stackblitz or codesandbox or jsfiddle or jsbin
[14:08:32] <OnkelBlade> I hoped there is a way to ask the browser

[14:28:55] <austincheney> sylario, your code errors for me:  querySelectorAll of null
[14:29:32] <austincheney> also querySelectorAll is one of the slowest operations you can perform in JavaScript

[20:38:29] <ThePendulum> anyway if you just want to render every column returned from the database, I would put Object.values instead of the for (j) iteration and have something like Object.values(result[i]).map((value) => `<td>${value}</td>`), not taking sanitation into account
