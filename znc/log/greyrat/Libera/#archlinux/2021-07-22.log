[00:16:18] <cmnky> at this point, I'm just going to copy the broken users files over to the new working user
[00:16:39] <cmnky> it doesn't provide any answers, but it seems to be a fix that takes little time
[00:16:55] <teraflops> so my guess is that you have root owned files in your home dir related to xfce, the only think that comes to mind is to run something like find . -type d -exec namei -mo {} \; | grep root at the root of your home dir 
[00:17:09] <teraflops> thing rather
[00:18:17] <cmnky> theres only 1 root owned file, and its a voip phone firmware .zip file I was working with yesterday
[00:18:47] <teraflops> then I run out of ideas I'm afraid
[00:19:04] <cmnky> its cool, I think the simple fix is to just delete and recreate the user

[02:31:25] <demize> Are the XPS keyboards better than what's on the rest of their more 'business' oriented laptops, or the same?
[02:31:26] <edgy> earnestly: x230 is only 12"? is that ok with you?
[02:31:30] <drop> Yeah, the Dell XPS 15 looks very good, but I wouldn't be opposed to a Thinkpad X1 Carbon either.
[02:32:04] <edgy> Fingel: you say they are just like any other laptop till you try the other ;)
[02:32:08] <earnestly> edgy: Wouldn't want a laptop larger
[02:32:30] <earnestly> x230 works with screenmods, coreboot, etc.
[02:32:45] <Fingel> Fair enough, I've only ever used Thinkpads and a macbook
[02:32:55] <demize> I wish they'd start making laptops with taller aspect ratios again.
[02:32:59] <drop> The older Thinkpad displays are just awful. It's tolerable if you're on a budget, but if money wasn't an issue, I'd definitely go for something else.
[02:33:25] <earnestly> Essentially frankenpads
[02:33:33] <edgy> earnestly: what do you mean by screenmods?
[02:33:36] <earnestly> Nothing else is even remotely close to being decent, imo
[02:33:40] <earnestly> (As a laptop)
[02:33:53] <Fingel> demize: yea what's up with that. My thinkpad has a wider/shorter screen than my Mac, and you'd think the "media experience" would be more important so it'd be the other way around.
[02:33:54] <earnestly> edgy: nitrocaster
[02:33:58] <Fingel> The super wide screens are terrible for coding
[02:34:38] <demize> Speaking of taller aspect ratios, Huawei is releasing a 28" 4k IPS 3:2 monitor, which is.. interesting.

[02:35:33] <tlgs> I asked this earlier but wondering if anyone can give me a few pointers; I installed Arch a couple of months ago and looked for the simplest configuration possible for the filesystem (i.e. ext4). I think I'm now comfortable enough to go for a "better" setup using BTRFS and disk encryption.
[02:35:39] <tlgs> As far as I understand this involves nuking my current system and install from scratch, is that correct? Any specific tips besides backing up all of my data/configs?

[02:36:08] <Namarrgon> you can back your system up, repartiton/reformat and then restore the backup
[02:36:49] <thurstylark> that's pretty much the big item. Save stuff so you can rebuild if disaster strikes. A full image makes this much easier
[02:37:03] <demize> There are tools for both converting an unencrypted block device to an encrypted one, and from ext4 to btrfs in-place.  I wouldn't trust either of them however.
[02:37:28] <Fingel> Yea plus there's nothing like that new Arch smell
[02:37:32] <Fingel> I'd just go for the reformat
[02:37:55] <tlgs> Perfect, thanks guys.

[04:10:29] <lantech19446> yea so opening up the router to access interdomain broadcasts doesn't make any more sense than consolidating it all into one network

[04:11:52] <cmnky> because it was making getting asterisk / voip working a headache

[04:12:51] <cmnky> its just kinda crazy with NAT is all, because of SIP/RTP handoffs
[04:13:19] <MacGyver> Why would you ever do NAT on an internal router? o.O
[04:13:56] <cmnky> because I have 2 HP EliteDesk mini pc's that I use as routers, and I copied the config from 1 to the other, and kept them relatively in sync
[04:14:35] <cmnky> which allowed me to test stuff on the internal one before applying it to the main one, and I have my office firewalled from the rest of the house so the smart TVs and chinese cameras don't get into my bank account
[04:15:00] <cmnky> it wasn't hurting anything until asterisk got involved
[04:15:03] <lantech19446> personally i don't see the point of having enterprise routers and firewalls on a soho network to begin with unless you're doing it to learn for your career

[04:16:08] <cmnky> its not an enterprise router ... its a cheap used HP ElitDesk ... I used OpenWRT / DDWRT on your standard consumer routers before that, but those were a pain to admin / flash
[04:16:29] <cmnky> my router/firewall is just a plain PC with arch linux and iptables
[04:16:48] <MacGyver> Also, FWIW, consolidating all that into a single /16 shouldn't be a problem, it's not as though you're actually adding 60.000 devices.

[04:42:22] <bougyman> Relying on a firewall for protection is a thing of the past.
[04:42:40] <bougyman> A bad idea that's proved itself inadequate.

[04:45:05] <MacGyver> Yeah... no. There's just way too many shitty devices that don't do their own protection properly to just throw out firewalls altogether.
[04:45:25] <MacGyver> I mean sure, conceptually I agree that endpoints shouldn't trust the networks they're attached to.

[04:49:50] <cmnky> and some day, maybe, if I get off Santas naughty list, I'll be able to turn my monitors off, because when I do that now, the nvidia drivers freeze the entire box
[04:50:02] <MacGyver> Oh nvidia :')

[15:03:51] <paperbenni> the first mirror in the default mirrorlist started randomly redirecting to this website
[15:03:53] <paperbenni> https://www.zerobounce.net/
[15:04:08] <paperbenni> it's the evowise mirror
[15:04:08] <paperbenni> https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=all&protocol=http&protocol=https&ip_version=4
[15:04:35] <paperbenni> pacman just downloads the html and inevitably fails to read it as a db file

[15:07:39] <aminvakil> worldwide first
[15:07:44] <grawity> (there's a reason they're all commented out by default)
[15:09:16] <paperbenni> wouldn't it make sense for pacman to try the next mirror if the db file of the current one is corrupted?
[15:09:45] <paperbenni> It also does this if a mirror is down, so why not also do it if the db file doesn't make any sense?
[15:09:59] <grawity> it might, but that's more of a question for developers in #archlinux-pacman I think

[17:15:54] <Keridos> After update to linux-5.13.4 I have a kworker that is eating up one core of my system permanently

[20:51:40] <grawity> yes, it's more or less bash array syntax
[20:51:41] <Namarrgon> kuhilas: is the "modconf" hook not already in the HOOKS array?
[20:52:05] <grawity> but more commonly you'd do these two specific things through HOOKS=(... modconf) and MODULES=(whatever synaptics needs)
[20:52:15] <kuhilas> the modconf is present in HOOKS
[20:52:17] <grawity> not sure why you need the touchpad in initramfs though
[20:52:45] <grawity> and also the xf86-input-synaptics has nothing to do with the kernel module for synaptics

[21:09:51] <kuhilas> Currently one blacklisted and one loaded in modules-load. if I don't include them in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf I guess then I'm in default state. I haven't added anything to xorg.conf yet

I set it up to to auto connect and it did when I booted until yesterday evening. Journalctl doesn't really give me any helpful messages. Just that it failed with 'exit-code'. ip link shows this wlo1 interface which it got renamed from wlan0

[22:13:10] <tatsumaru> hey guys I want to format a drive in ext4 that used to be ntfs so that I can use it on my system. it's a data drive, so no OS on it. do I have to wipe it first or do i simply mkfs and fstab?
[22:13:24] <tatsumaru> (i know that I can use it as ntfs too but I don't want to)
[22:14:04] <grawity> it's a good idea to use wipefs to delete the bits that currently make its contents recognizable as NTFS
[22:14:14] <grawity> otherwise you can end up in situations where some tools see it as ext4, others as NTFS
[22:14:30] <NthDegree> I'd also change the partition identifier to be Linux not HPFS
[22:14:38] <grawity> but it's not necessary to do a full wipe
[22:14:43] <tatsumaru> grawity how do i do this
[22:14:54] <grawity> run `wipefs --all /dev/sdc5` or wherever the partition is
[22:15:22] <NthDegree> you can also just dd the first 100MB or so
[22:15:30] <grawity> not for all filesystems
[22:15:55] <tatsumaru> grawity it deleted 8 bytes and completed near instantly, was that the expected outcome?
[22:15:58] <grawity> yeah
[22:16:16] <tatsumaru> NthDegree do I change the partition identifier with fdisk?
[22:16:40] <NthDegree> yeah you can do

[22:17:30] <kuhilas> phew this wifi problem was a monkey brain problem from me at least. I had pressed the "airplane" key on the top row to make wifi "powered off". The iwd's device list showed me it's in "off" state and figured it out that way. Well I will be trying this iwd now.
[22:17:43] *** Joins: kulak1 (~kulak@user/kulak)
[22:17:48] <grawity> the MBR has both the bootcode and the partition table crammed into a single sector

[22:17:59] <NthDegree> tatsumaru: MBR is the type of partition table
[22:18:19] <h4rd3n3D> kuhilas:  to clear, you never installed 'wifi-menu' as there is no such package.  wifi-menu has always been provided by netctl.  As you now know, during install iwd/iwctl work well, but on my WiFi only laptops, I prefer to install NetworkManager to manage connectivity.  Use what works well for you
[22:18:28] <grawity> but the partition table is part of the same structure, so it's still called a "MBR" in general
[22:18:49] <h4rd3n3D> to *be clear
[22:19:23] <tatsumaru> NthDegree it says disklabel type dos
[22:20:00] <tatsumaru> that's mbr right

[23:25:19] <h4rd3n3D> why?  LVM on LUKS / encryption is more secure
[23:25:19] <p9> i don't think grub has anything to do with it

[23:59:22] <h4rd3n3D> MacGyver:  you should probably ask 'our' newest minted 'Astronaut', but very fair queries, indeed :)
[23:59:24] <p9> I wonder how robust the autologin is. It probably varies with each display manager. you essentially want it to autologin only once after boot (and unlocking system) without any chance to trigger after logout
