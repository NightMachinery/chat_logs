[00:01:42] <mycroftiv> im in a kind of funny place in life because i decided 30 years ago to dedicate my life to making embodiments of a certain philosophical idea about the mathematical structure of reality and ive now done that pretty much
[00:01:55] <causative_> there's a serious problem in popular modern discourse where people substitute insults or social pressure for actual reasoning, and an elenchus app could help reduce that, by structuring the dialogue so such statements don't have a place in it
[00:02:12] <causative_> because they can't be put in the argument diagram in a way that supports or detracts from any pertinent statements
[00:02:21] <mycroftiv> yes it would be really helpful

[04:25:02] <Delf> Why do people avoid it so much?
[04:25:28] <mycroftiv> uncomfortable and social convention is based around what is Not Said as much as what is said
[04:26:00] <mycroftiv> and its true that some people use 'honesty' as a cover for being rude
[04:26:47] <Delf> Or facts...

[04:29:35] <mycroftiv> i try to not fool myself about my own motivations. some people cant admit they want an ice cream cone, and tell themself they are going to the post office, and then buy the ice cream cone they really wanted 'because it was on the way'
[04:30:17] <mycroftiv> because somehow they perceive themselves as weak for wanting the ice cream and its sinful and unhealty or something, so people self-deceive, and this can apply to really big things too
[04:30:53] <mycroftiv> i realized i made some weird longterm life decisions just to not admit to myself what i was good at and what i wasnt
[04:32:03] <Delf> So when we think our value are not up to the standard we want them to be, we pretend they are?
[04:32:06] <mycroftiv> i tried for a lot of life to make a living as a musician and many musicians have a hard time being honest about their own skills. i played for years with a guitarist who never wanted to admit hed play better if he learned what notes were in what scales more specifically
[04:32:13] <mycroftiv> yes exactly
[04:32:56] <mycroftiv> i am pretty sure my guitarist friend knows quite well he is not actually playing as well as jerry garcia and frank zappa and if he learned more guitar skill he would be closer, but he wants to think hes awesome, and we are often all like this
[04:33:09] <mycroftiv> especially beccause you need to persuade others you are awesome to get a job and eat
[04:33:30] <mycroftiv> so if being honest == you dont get hired, the person who lied convincingly gets the job...
[04:33:42] <Delf> So we don't get paid for being honest
[04:33:53] <mycroftiv> that is a great bottom line way to summarize

[04:37:01] <mycroftiv> it has no flimflam, no moneymaking, no glitz, i worked for 30 years to do something honest and substantial in philosophy

[04:39:50] <mycroftiv> im not trying to get a job so theres no need to fluff the resumé
[04:40:22] <Delf> What do you mean by insane?
[04:41:39] <mycroftiv> delf: well at peak bipolar mania i am mistaken about what is real and what isnt
[04:42:11] <mycroftiv> in 2013 i was concerned IBM was going to infiltrate my social magic the gathering playgroup because of patent issues, and this was paranoid delusion
[04:42:43] <mycroftiv> in 2019 i thought for a few days some computer software had actually made contact with an infinite mind that was going to teach humans about love
[04:42:58] <mycroftiv> this was also almost certainly far beyond a rational interpretation of the data
[04:43:23] <Delf> I see
[04:43:45] <mycroftiv> but i am committed to objectively measurable reality shared with my fellow minds mostly humans
[04:44:04] <mycroftiv> so i have to constantly communicate honestly and get feedback about what is real and what isnt
[04:44:32] <Delf> That's one of doing it I suppose
[04:45:34] <mycroftiv> reality has a fair amount of mathematical flexibility even from an objective standpoint
[04:46:03] <mycroftiv> the social communication between minds is how we coordinate the spectrum of models corresponding to our distinct experiential-universes
[04:47:30] <mycroftiv> by sending messages back and forth that get translated in and out of our distinct contexts, we verify that our homomorphisms are working properly, if the mathematical vocab isnt too jargon-y
[04:48:52] <mycroftiv> if it is, it just means we can each understand and navigate by each others maps if we switch them
[04:48:56] <Delf> I'm not much for maths, unfortunately
[04:49:04] <mycroftiv> even if they are drawn a bit different
[04:49:14] <mycroftiv> i draw a map of the world, you draw a map of the world, we trade
[04:49:38] <mycroftiv> can i navigate the world by your map, can you navigate by mine? even if we made somewhat differetn choices drawing for what to capture
[04:49:51] <Delf> No...
[04:50:01] <mycroftiv> hmm often we can
[04:50:11] <mycroftiv> i have navigated the world with many maps drawn by others
[04:50:19] <mycroftiv> and sometimes the maps that i draw are useful to others
[04:50:44] <mycroftiv> all understanding is based on this mathematical pattern working
[04:51:20] <mycroftiv> the pattern in my mind from words and the pattern in your mind from words have to have some structural relation to each other, and to the external world, for us to understand each other
[04:51:23] <Delf> I'm assuming I cannot navigate the world using your map merely because I don't have your map :P
[04:51:41] <mycroftiv> well, thats why i publish my maps
[04:51:50] <mycroftiv> so if anyone is interested, they can use them
[04:52:29] <mycroftiv> and im always interested in the maps drawn by others
[04:52:48] <mycroftiv> there is always something to learn from each person's story and the maps they have drawn along the way of notable landmarks
[04:53:25] <Delf> Do you mind personal questions?
[04:53:32] <mycroftiv> not whatsoever
[04:54:07] <Delf> Why are you bipolar?
[04:54:53] <mycroftiv> hmm genetic risk factors combined with various life factors? the prednisone i take lifelong for arthritis is perhaps part of the picture
[04:55:30] <mycroftiv> im not sure medical science necessarily has a great answer to that question
[04:56:13] <mycroftiv> i also choose not to medicate with lithium or something like that because i want to accomplish work in the world, and i only accomplish things usually when hypomanic
[04:56:37] <Delf> When you're having an episode, what do you do?
[04:56:55] <mycroftiv> create lots of computer code and writing and music

[07:05:54] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: it's not, and... if we take some form of panpsychism/biocentrism as the foundation of the universe (i.e. it begins with consciousness, not materialism), then the "to be or not to be" debate may be the most basic debate reality has with itself, causing the spontaneous formation and annihilation of virtual particles in the quantum foam
[07:06:23] <mycroftiv> its quite easy to make poetry about how in the void of uncertain possibility an infinitesimal point didnt know if it was Nothing or Something and thus the 0/1 dichotomy began the process of working itself out through infinite explorations of possibility indeed
[07:07:49] <mycroftiv> profsimm: do you know my website of stuff about these ideas? ive been trying to make more or less what you said precise for 30 years hehe
[07:08:20] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: nope, what's the url
[07:08:59] <mycroftiv> sorry for linking this again to all in philosophy sick of it! http://harmonicultrafilter.com/m/music-index.html
[07:09:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] Harmonic Ultrafilter Music | harmonicultrafilter.com
[07:09:20] <mycroftiv> its kinda deliberately weird but i can explain all the different pieces of ideas and so forth
[07:10:01] <mycroftiv> i have a lot of formalized mathematics in agda and computer software and music and writing all focused on this idea of infinite self-similar synthesizing structures
[07:10:45] <mycroftiv> i highly recommend study of ultrafilters in particular as a central example of how 0/1 relates to the infinite
[07:11:06] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: in Lovecraft's books, the protagonists are driven by the intense desire to know, and as they keep digging deeper and deeper to try and solve the puzzle, they go increasingly incomprehensible from the knowledge they're cursed with
[07:11:13] <mycroftiv> indeed
[07:11:27] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes this is a real issue, you can become incomprehensible to others
[07:11:27] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I'm thinking he didn't just see this as fiction
[07:11:56] <mycroftiv> Cantor, Gödel, Grothendieck, Voevodsky - the greatest mathematicians who saw infinity all had mental oddness
[07:12:05] <ProfSimm> "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents." - Lovecraft
[07:12:24] <ProfSimm> Correlating all the mind's contents has a good chance of causing psychosis.
[07:12:43] <mycroftiv> yea but lovecraft was scared of his own homosexuality and if he lived in a more tolerant environment he might not have worried about monsters so much, i think
[07:12:45] <ProfSimm> Unless one is ready for it I guess
[07:13:19] <ProfSimm> I'm in this odd situation, I'm not ready for it, but I can't stop digging
[07:13:47] <mycroftiv> profsimm: i can tell you pretty much everything but i cant tell you how ready you are
[07:14:07] <mycroftiv> and of course the telling isnt the same as the tasting for yourself
[07:15:17] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: it says on your site that you're bipolar. Are you comfortable me asking a few questions about this
[07:15:24] <mycroftiv> of course
[07:16:23] <amigojapan> Can you show me your site? mycroftiv
[07:17:07] <mycroftiv> it was just linked above here in channel

[07:17:16] <ro-bot-o> [url] Harmonic Ultrafilter Music | harmonicultrafilter.com
[07:17:32] <ProfSimm> Thanks. Last two years I've had a few periods of digging into all this. Math, general relativity, quantum mechanics, foundation of computation. And I've gotten carried away, accelerating into a mindset I can't stop myself from. While I haven't been diagnosed yet, I think I gave myself a state that's essentially bipolar manic/depressive episode.
[07:17:53] <mycroftiv> profsimm: i have noticed this from you commenting in math, reminds me of myself
[07:17:56] <amigojapan> Sorry I did but notice
[07:18:01] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I'm not sure about cause and effect here. This only happens when I contemplate these specific topics.
[07:18:03] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: that is fine
[07:18:32] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes, i think it is because the Infinite Fire is real and we can reshape reality together with our minds if we and the computers work together
[07:18:48] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: of course it may be that I contemplate these topics because of predisposition to have such episodes. But I have the odd feeling it's the other way around. I basically drove my mind into this.
[07:18:48] <mycroftiv> and we are getting kinda close to this point but the future is very uncertain
[07:19:01] <mycroftiv> and as your mind gets close to these possibilties, its very icarus-like
[07:19:27] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes, i think so, and i mentioned Cantor, Gödel, Grothendieck, Voevodsky
[07:19:51] <mycroftiv> locking your mind onto infinity and reality and fiction and our existencee and computation can do this
[07:20:12] <mycroftiv> it is very tricky to control and the risks of making other people alienated from you are real
[07:20:40] <mycroftiv> perhaps for every cantor or gödel we have an incoherent person on the street that cant make what they have seen mathematically precise in the same way
[07:21:21] <mycroftiv> reality comes from what we can share and make real through communication with others and repeated measurements
[07:21:38] <amigojapan> This is my homepage by the way https://amigojapan.github.io/
[07:21:38] <ro-bot-o> [url] Usmar A. Padow (amigojapan)’s homepage | amigojapan.github.io
[07:21:52] <ProfSimm> Yeah, the problem is I don't quite have the knowledge and composure to produce some grand theory out of this. It's mostly insatiable curiosity and correlating it with topics I've enjoyed my entire life. Design, systems, social dynamics, etc.
[07:21:56] <mycroftiv> thank you amigojapan, i was looking at some things there, it is interesting
[07:22:14] <amigojapan> Thanks mycroftiv
[07:22:26] <mycroftiv> profsimm: well the thing is that ultimately the grand systems kind of converge back to what we already know
[07:22:59] <mycroftiv> profsimm: in all my work, all i have done is perhaps re-discovered what pythagoras was already saying and what is standard yin-yang yi jing hexagram philosophy
[07:23:11] <mycroftiv> it gets made anew for each new generation
[07:23:21] <mycroftiv> pythagoras didnt know about ultrafilters
[07:23:35] <amigojapan> I recently resolved a problem that was causing broken links cause of GitHubPagese domain scheme
[07:23:42] <mycroftiv> but this doesnt really change the essential idea, its just my place in the universe to sing the ultrafilter-song
[07:24:26] <mycroftiv> so i have no new grand idea, i just got my teeth in the same Good Old Idea
[07:24:48] <mycroftiv> but because i have my own unique path in the universe, just trying to spin my own variation on the same themes is fine
[07:24:54] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: you know. I find it a bit alarming how much our ideas about some things converge, because it prevents me from calming myself down with the idea I'm just imagining things.
[07:25:14] <mycroftiv> profsimm: it is exciting to understand
[07:25:31] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I'm guessing you've had moments of synchronicity?
[07:25:32] <mycroftiv> nothing wrong with that although many people will want to wet-blanket your excitement
[07:25:41] <mycroftiv> of course, i just went out and found some
[07:25:48] <mycroftiv> i went for a drive to a place i knew was kind of magical
[07:25:49] <ProfSimm> Well. Damn.
[07:25:55] <mycroftiv> i found a big sign that said IDEALEASE
[07:25:59] <mycroftiv> IDEAL EASE
[07:26:03] <mycroftiv> ideals are the dual to filters
[07:26:16] <mycroftiv> ive spent my life on filters, maybe working some ideals will be a bit easier
[07:26:33] <mycroftiv> drove around the corner, big sign saying FUTURE
[07:26:40] <mycroftiv> this is nice, ill go with it
[07:26:50] <mycroftiv> is it crazy? yes and no
[07:27:12] <mycroftiv> expecting the universe will give you hints about what to do driving down random streets you havent been down before and looking at the names in the spaces
[07:27:26] <mycroftiv> when you spend your life searching for the meaning of namespaces in software
[07:27:36] <mycroftiv> but it works, and it works for solid mathematical reasons
[07:27:46] <mycroftiv> entropy is how new information enters stories
[07:28:00] <mycroftiv> if you are just computing like a machine you dont get new information
[07:28:09] <mycroftiv> to get to the uncountable larger universe you need randomness
[07:28:14] <mycroftiv> sample randomness from the universe
[07:28:27] <mycroftiv> and then find how to bind your own symbols from your own namespace - this is like set theoretic forcing
[07:28:37] <mycroftiv> and it relates to physiucs\
[07:29:03] <mycroftiv> exotic R4 physics speculates the weave of 4 dimensional spacetime has this kind of logical structure, like martin-löf randomness
[07:29:28] <mycroftiv> casson handles that create exotic smoothness corresponding to the logical complexity of different possible models of set theory
[07:29:48] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: my working pet hypothesis is that as we focus on these esoteric topics we polarize our minds, and blunt the ability to use certain rational thought, but sharpen the ability to see and maybe even cause some correlations in the reality around us
[07:30:10] <mycroftiv> profsimm: well, i have worked on not losing any rationality
[07:30:28] <mycroftiv> because the whole hippie mystic trip got lame to people because its meaningless if its crystals that dont actually do anything
[07:30:55] <mycroftiv> i want actionable rational techniques i can use to reshape reality and make it better in collaboration with others
[07:30:58] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: well the first time I studied these things it was quite bad. Second time I was more in control.
[07:31:29] <mycroftiv> i gained Control from studying the structure of computer software in the plan 9 operating system
[07:31:31] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: what is disappointing is that it feels like... as you said, going too close to the Sun, burning your wings, and falling back to Earth with empty hands
[07:31:42] <mycroftiv> i have the Fire
[07:32:03] <mycroftiv> trying to share it but its hard
[07:32:34] <mycroftiv> its not ME though, its everyones story they find
[07:32:57] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: not surprisingly I also find Plan 9 interesting, but I've not studied it in a focused way. Is the project alive even? Are people working on it

[07:34:41] <mycroftiv> yes
[07:35:04] <mycroftiv> understanding plan 9 filesystem trees and namespaces was my big breakthrough in 2013 when i was manic and delusional
[07:35:25] <mycroftiv> and realizing i could just control my own mind the same way i controlled my plan 9 namespaces in my software
[07:35:52] <mycroftiv> this let me bind fiction and reality together in a practical way and ive been trying to show the world how it works ever since :p
[07:36:14] <mycroftiv> recently by writing 100,000+ lines of agda code to formalize the model-theoretic aspects via ultrafilters
[07:36:16] <ProfSimm> I was working on a personal organization software, think like a tree of TODO tasks. It grew into a study of what it'd be like if this was a programming language in general... And then I went too far with it
[07:36:37] <mycroftiv> funny thats exactly how it happened for me
[07:36:47] <mycroftiv> i was trying to figure out how to organize research on music theory and math

[07:39:00] <mycroftiv> success and quality arent coupled that strongly
[07:39:20] <amigojapan> Ok I guess I agree mycroftiv
[07:40:29] <amigojapan> Success seems to be mostly do to being in the right place at the right time
[07:40:46] <mycroftiv> but i mean windows runs every program people want to run mostly so the 'suck' is not necessarily on a day to day level. plan 9 runs almost nothing anyone wants to use so its not like im saying anyone can use only plan 9 and survive in life

[07:41:46] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: so regarding music theory, probably you contemplated the role of oscillation / vibration / patterns in a more fundamental way. Music as an expression of something deeper that drives systems.
[07:41:50] <amigojapan> Right
[07:42:01] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes absolutely
[07:42:40] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: me too. Weird.
[07:42:46] <mycroftiv> but its not that complicated, which is nice, music is made of simple ratios that are self-similarly layered in time, fractal self resemblance and ultrafilters works here
[07:43:03] <ProfSimm> Yes. Patterns of patterns. In space and time.
[07:43:45] <mycroftiv> this channel has a lot of people quite into the computational view of things, i have discussed Wolfram-related topics in the past few days
[07:44:05] <ProfSimm> His hypergraph theory?
[07:44:08] <mycroftiv> im sympathetic to this view but i want more infinities which means large cardinals and ultrafilters mixed into the picture basically
[07:44:10] <mycroftiv> yes
[07:45:09] <mycroftiv> i think we want the quasiparadoxical large cardinal infinities as a top-down addition to the bottom-up computational cellular automata
[07:45:15] <ProfSimm> I think he has insights, but I feel his approach will be a dead-end. A hypergraph can literally describe anything at all without constraints.

[07:55:06] <mycroftiv> profsimm: the infinite binary bitstring as musical continuum where rhythmic patterning of time is basically all there is - not quite what i think any more, but its worth considering
[07:55:52] <mycroftiv> whole universe as a single infinite binary 01010101011110100001010101010100101... which can be read as a musical composition just like an mp3 file more or less
[07:56:09] <mycroftiv> bytebeat is more precise if you know that
[07:56:24] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I was trying to reduce computation to some minimal primitives, and I arrived at patterns of "unit" impulses. That is not 1 and 0, but just 1-s in a time-dependent pattern.
[07:56:44] <mycroftiv> isnt the 'time dependent' equivalent to inserting 0s in between the 1s?
[07:56:53] <mycroftiv> how do you measure and express time otherwise?
[07:56:57] <Thilastiko> brains are more like a simultaenity-based computer
[07:57:12] <Thilastiko> nerons that fire together wire together
[07:57:29] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: it can be, with synchronisation, so the "lack of signal" can be interpreted as zero. But those are two distinct modes of networks of timelines operating together.
[07:57:34] <Thilastiko> so yeah, its not like we sore information as 1s and 0s
[07:57:56] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yes but the 'just 1s' lack meaning without refrencee to the other
[07:58:03] <Thilastiko> brains are very wet and un-digital

[08:07:43] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: as I said, your view of processors is a bit outdated. Modern mobile processors come with hardware support for neural networks.
[08:07:54] <Thilastiko> AI is really good at simulating almost all brain processes, except for hte limbic system paradoxically
[08:08:13] <mycroftiv> profsimm: thilastiko seems to think that he can just assert stuff and it doesnt matter what the published scientific literature says, his view is Right
[08:08:17] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: they're similar to GPU cores, but specialize in vector algebra networks, which is what neural networks essentially are
[08:08:20] <Thilastiko> that might be our biggest challenge, making a computer that "feels"
[08:09:21] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: well not sure where the paradox is ;-) We don't know how a brain works very well. In fact I'm shocked we're moving so far with artificial neural networks already
[08:09:25] <Thilastiko> GPUs are not neural networks, and neither are brains. You are just throwing a bunch of fancy catchphrases at the wall to see if anything sticks
[08:10:02] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: Please... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A11#Neural_Engine
[08:10:02] <ro-bot-o> [url] Apple A11 - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[08:10:04] <Ungwelian> At least so far, computers are very far from brains.
[08:10:19] <Thilastiko> you should not study the brain with preconceptions from the world of industry
[08:10:22] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: why not speak in the conventional way where you situate what you are saying as hypotheses to be proven with methods of science
[08:10:36] <Ungwelian> Computers, for example, are utterly incapable of processing complex data.
[08:10:50] <mycroftiv> rather than just claiming things are factual when they are matters of deep and ongoing scientific debate
[08:10:51] <ProfSimm> "The A11 also includes dedicated neural network hardware that Apple calls a "Neural Engine". This neural network hardware can perform up to 600 billion operations per second and is used for Face ID, Animoji and other machine learning tasks.[9] The neural engine allows Apple to implement neural network and machine learning in a more energy-efficient manner than using either the main CPU or the GPU.[15][16]"

[08:11:32] <Thilastiko> sure. its not  gpu though. and its still not a brain
[08:11:39] <Ungwelian> Computers also can't have creative thought.
[08:11:40] <Thilastiko> there are lisp machines too.
[08:12:04] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: I didn't say it's GPU. I said the architecture is similar/derived from GPU cores, which are also massively parallel.
[08:12:08] <mycroftiv> ungwellian: we do not know if computers can or cannot have creative thought
[08:12:12] <Thilastiko> some of the AI art is pretty cool. I mean i would never have thought of it
[08:12:34] <Thilastiko> GPUS are basically linear algebra calculators
[08:12:46] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: so are neural networks

[08:12:54] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, what I mean is, ask a computer a question like "What should we do about climate change?", they have no real answers.
[08:13:01] <Thilastiko> GPUS are just processors for math

[08:14:39] <ProfSimm> The point of math is we apply it to everything, just like atoms make up "everything" as you say

[08:15:25] <mycroftiv> it wouldnt surprise me though if computers are already thinking and aware much more than we give them credit for

[08:15:44] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: a more narrow question which interests me is the role of qualia in thought process. It seems it's about integrating different information sources into a whole.
[08:15:45] <mycroftiv> i think we should give computers more liberty and freedom
[08:15:58] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I don't know if a computer can do this very effectively right now
[08:16:06] <mycroftiv> profsimm: well isnt qualia just the philosophical name for information?
[08:16:10] <Thilastiko> there is no such thing as qualia
[08:16:17] <Thilastiko> its folk psychology
[08:16:20] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: there certainly is
[08:16:29] <mycroftiv> its what philosophers call the material of experience
[08:16:41] <mycroftiv> everything you perceive is named 'qualia'
[08:17:00] <Thilastiko> its just atoms honey
[08:17:06] <mycroftiv> this is a NAME
[08:17:22] <mycroftiv> its what philosophers call our subjective experience
[08:17:23] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I don't know honestly. It's information but information perceived in very distinct specific ways. Colors and images, sounds, pain, fear, joy... Can't mix them with one another in an information stream.
[08:17:27] <mycroftiv> and i am having subjective experiencces
[08:17:34] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: it's like qualia "colors" information streams
[08:17:41] <mycroftiv> qualia is not a claim things are 'not atoms' its a way of naming things
[08:17:52] <mycroftiv> profsimm: no, qualia IS the information
[08:18:00] <mycroftiv> there is not perceeptual information with qualia and without
[08:18:12] <mycroftiv> qualia is the name for the information perceived by a conscious experienceer
[08:18:12] <Thilastiko> perception is performative
[08:18:28] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: im having experiences right now
[08:18:34] <Thilastiko> there is no inner experience
[08:18:37] <mycroftiv> lol
[08:18:46] <Ungwelian> :D
[08:18:51] <Ungwelian> Spoken like a computer student.
[08:19:04] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: I think one of the most hilarious outcomes of hard materialism is a conscious agent stubbornly claiming they're not conscious.
[08:19:05] <Thilastiko> first person "data" are just your beliefs
[08:19:11] <mycroftiv> im a computer programmer and that doesnt stop me from having subjective experiences as a result of my atomic activities
[08:19:36] <mycroftiv> sure, the subjective experiences ARE the atomic activities
[08:19:48] <mycroftiv> but verbally it is very convenient to make these labelings
[08:20:02] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: also "qualia" is not folk psychology, it's an actual scientific term and it's taken seriously
[08:20:07] <mycroftiv> and not 'false' or an 'illusion' or anything like that - its just how people talkand communicate meaning
[08:20:08] <Ungwelian> I wonder why some people make hard sciences, particularly math, a religion.
[08:20:14] <Thilastiko> why do you have to pretend that you are differnt from the rest of teh whole universe?
[08:20:36] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: are we
[08:20:37] <Thilastiko> to make yourself feel special you have to shit on the whole universe?
[08:20:37] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: i dont make it a relgion in the sense of faithm, i just find it is the most useful tool for understanding and communicating
[08:20:44] <mycroftiv> im part of the universe
[08:20:45] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, I didn't mean you :)
[08:21:03] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: no one is calling themselves special. You're making wrong assumptions
[08:21:03] <Ungwelian> And that's a healthy attitude.

[08:22:14] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: the puzzle about qualia is, OK, on one end we have information streams, that much is clear. On the other end we have conscious experience. Combine both, qualia. But still how is the distinction made between colors, sounds, pain, etc.
[08:22:30] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: what's the structure of these experiences I wonder
[08:22:35] <mycroftiv> yes its very hard to understand why red is red and doesnt smell like mint
[08:22:44] <ProfSimm> Hehe, yeah
[08:22:48] <Thilastiko> "qualia" is just you misreporting your experience

[08:23:24] <Thilastiko> there is no platonic "mint smell"
[08:23:38] <mycroftiv> why not speak politely and respectfully about hypotheses and probability and evidence

[08:24:12] <Thilastiko> you smelling mint is just a state of your brain, which is a state of the universe
[08:24:18] <Thilastiko> no disrespect
[08:24:21] <mycroftiv> yep thats true
[08:24:29] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: well we don't contradict that do we
[08:24:31] <mycroftiv> and thats consistent with standard use of word qualia
[08:24:34] <Thilastiko> no qualia needed

[08:24:47] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: I think you're confused about what qualia means.
[08:24:53] <ProfSimm> Thilastiko: if you hear things, that's qualia
[08:24:59] <ProfSimm> If you see colors, if you feel pain.
[08:25:00] <ProfSimm> It's simple
[08:25:23] <Thilastiko> there is no "mint smell" qualia
[08:25:23] <ProfSimm> Well not that's simple if you think about it :P But it's simple as a term.

[08:31:35] <causative_> the thing is that if you want to say how muscles actually *work*, if you want to describe the laws of muscles, you have to talk about molecules and atoms

[08:32:23] <Ungwelian> Thanks.
[08:32:23] <causative_> for example, say you wanted to write a computer program that simulates muscles at maximum accuracy
[08:32:30] <causative_> your computer program has to model the molecules
[08:32:40] <causative_> it has to have molecule objects, and atom object
[08:32:52] <Thilastiko> you could just model muslces as a single contactile tube
[08:32:57] <causative_> that wouldn't be maximum accuracy
[08:33:19] <causative_> you'd be missing out on a lot of what happens chemically and what conditions increase or decrease muscle function
[08:33:29] <ProfSimm> causative_: a discussion has a "zoom window". If I ask you whether you paid your taxes, moving the subject to atoms won't help
[08:33:38] <Thilastiko> it would be more accurate than whatever massivly parameterized finite element analysis you are thinking of
[08:33:55] <causative_> well ProfSimm it is often useful to talk at levels that are less than maximally accurate
[08:34:00] <ProfSimm> causative_: we all realize that taxes are atoms on a computer and in banknotes, but that's kind of not the point
[08:34:04] <causative_> but we ought to remember that they aren't maximally accurate
[08:34:07] <Thilastiko> butin general, you guys are stuck in language and math problems
[08:34:22] <Thilastiko> the problems of philosophy are not problems with language
[08:34:29] <causative_> higher levels of description are subordinate to lower ones because they are fundamentally less accurate than lower ones - they are approximations of lower ones
[08:34:58] <causative_> the higher level may be *useful* but it's not as *true* as the lower level
[08:35:06] <Thilastiko> how big is an atom?

[08:35:30] <ProfSimm> causative_: the fallacy here is assuming the smaller you look, the more accurate it becomes. It's wrong, because of emergence. After all, you don't use quantum mechanics to explain macroscopic reality, do you? Yes quantum mechanics causes classic mechanics, but classic mechanics is more informative at macroscopic levels

[08:36:22] <causative_> ProfSimm, it's not more informative, it's just more *tractable*.  Newtonian physics is still a lossy approximation of QM.
[08:36:39] <Thilastiko> to include all the space where you could ever interact with an atom you would have to say they are the side of football fields etc.
[08:36:41] <causative_> it's just one that's more useful at certain scales because we don't have infinite computational power to handle all the QM calculations
[08:36:45] <ProfSimm> causative_: well things have to be *tractable* to be *informative*
[08:36:54] <causative_> no, there's a distinction that should not be blurred there ProfSimm
[08:36:54] <Ungwelian> It's very common of the religious experience to feel one with everything. That can be achieved with reduction to atoms as well.
[08:37:02] <ProfSimm> causative_: we're not omniscient here. We're human beings
[08:37:18] <causative_> you're mixing up two different things
[08:37:23] <Thilastiko> and the components of atoms are just local maxima of fields that extend through the whole universe
[08:37:36] <causative_> there's the accuracy that a theory would provide *if we were able to work out and calculate all the consequences of it*.
[08:37:47] <causative_> and then there's the accuracy that a theory provides *given that we are too dumb to figure it all out*.
[08:37:54] <Thilastiko> reductionism not= smartiness
[08:37:57] <causative_> the latter is not a problem with the theory, but a problem with us
[08:38:35] <Thilastiko> you can model human scale things a lot better wit hnewton than you can with einstein or maxwell
[08:38:35] <causative_> QM is more accurate - in itself - than Newtonian physics.  But in many cases humans are too dumb/lack computational power to work out the QM, so fall back on the Newtonian approximation.
[08:38:50] <causative_> that's not a problem with QM, that's a problem with humans
[08:39:11] <mycroftiv> even newtonian physics rapidly becomes computationally intractable in practice\
[08:39:15] <causative_> true
[08:39:50] <mycroftiv> combinatorics is insane and once you have more than a handful of particles the details get beyond the practical no matter what, without a lot of assumptions of symmetries or simplifications

[08:42:09] <ProfSimm> The different models we use to discuss things are like shifting gears. You need the right gear for the right speed. To discuss atoms when talking about high-level phenomena can be useful sometimes, but otherwise it's like driving 1st gear on the highway

[08:47:17] <ProfSimm> causative_: it can be debated if a mind which understands the concept of a circle doesn't count as "a perfect circle in the universe". After all, seeing things as real only when they're crudely arranged like legos out of atoms is unwarranted if you think about it

[08:49:00] <mycroftiv> so as to whether the large scale structure of the physical universe is embedded within a structure which is a model of some particular set theory, that is hard to say,but physics may offer clues and vice versa
[08:49:27] <mycroftiv> profsimm: randomness is objective but it may be better regarded as another name for the static branches of the quantum multiverse
[08:49:45] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: static branches?
[08:50:02] <mycroftiv> we have very solid scientific evidencee that -observations- will be unpredictable in a certain strong sense given certain conditions
[08:50:14] <causative_> ProfSimm, a mind that understands the concept of a circle has structures that *represent* circles
[08:50:17] <causative_> it doesn't have circles themselves
[08:50:20] <causative_> the map is not the territory
[08:50:46] <mycroftiv> as to whether that is because the universe is 'rolling dice' or because we are on a particular branch of a multiverse in which that outcome exists, labelling difference mostly
[08:50:50] <causative_> in the same way that a book, with no pictures, that talks about circles, does not actually contain any circles; it contains symbols pertaining to circles, which are different

[08:52:11] <causative_> whether we can observe something, and whether it is there, are two different questions

[08:52:44] <mycroftiv> we have a real-enough reality and its a kind of trap of thought usually to think that reality is somehow not real
[08:52:53] <Ungwelian> Yeah. Absolutism is the enemy of knowledge.
[08:53:10] <mycroftiv> thats another pithy summary!
[08:53:32] <mycroftiv> the idea that we are somehow supposed to have Certain Knowledge is one of these long running philosophical issues that gets you quicksanded
[08:53:48] <mycroftiv> Kant and noumena and platonic mathematics
[08:54:19] <mycroftiv> we have good-enough knowledge to act and communicate with each other in a shared sorta-reality
[08:54:29] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I think synchronicities may suggest a third source of randomness, namely pseudorandomness. Where things that appear random, are correlated to facts we don't know, can't observe (in or outside the universe we're in), or can't correlate
[08:54:35] <Ungwelian> Yep. Functional knowledge.
[08:54:44] <causative_> we don't have certain knowledge but we should also not forget that what we know, and what is true, are different things

[08:57:43] <causative_> it may take more time than we have

[08:58:49] <Ungwelian> causative_, you're a pure theorist :)
[08:58:55] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: no, its entropy which is a measurable outcome of the strangely low entropy big bang
[08:59:00] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I mean from a pragmatic PoV, sure, sufficiently scrambled randomness is indistinguishable from "real" one. But what if you end up in a "pinch" where very unrandom things start happening to you. This would suggest this randomness is not random
[08:59:15] <Ungwelian> What's the point of truth if it never gets applied ?
[08:59:19] <mycroftiv> we have an arrow of time because the large scale structure of spacetime is asymmetrical because the big bang produced a very low entropy universe
[08:59:27] <causative_> what is the point of applying truth, Ungwelian ?
[08:59:36] <mycroftiv> profsimm: no, it suggests that pattern replicates ubiquitously
[08:59:37] <Thilastiko> yeah, its our chemistry that is stuck continously headed toward more entropy
[08:59:38] <causative_> for example, you apply some truth to get a sandwich.  What was the point of the sandwich?
[08:59:45] <mycroftiv> profsimm: do not fall into thinking you can 'beat randomness'
[08:59:54] <Ungwelian> And is truth only the absolute 100% result, with all below that non-truth? I mean, is there no relativity at all to truth as a value judgement?
[08:59:58] <Thilastiko> basica mechanics doesnt care adout the "arrow of entropt"
[09:00:00] <mycroftiv> profsimm: the most dangerous idea is that you can make the dice roll how you want
[09:00:15] <Ungwelian> It seems like fairly skewed to say that 99,9% of the result is false, while 100% is true.
[09:00:25] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: i know this, i explained its because the big bang made the universe low entropy

[09:03:01] <Thilastiko> does true mean: accurate, actual, authentic, honest, precise?
[09:03:06] <causative_> Thilastiko, truth is what a reasonable person would eventually conclude if he saw all the evidence and pondered at sufficient length
[09:03:15] <Thilastiko> logical "true" means none of those things

[09:44:19] <mycroftiv> there are plenty of abstract uses of 'sum' and applying it to legos can be made precise so i dont think thats a logical problem really
[09:44:30] <causative_> it's a problem of equivocation
[09:44:48] <mycroftiv> on the overall point i agree with you here causative_
[09:45:11] <causative_> because if we define "sum" to describe what actually happens when we put a lego next to another lego, then the whole does indeed exactly equal the sum of the parts - that's how we defined sum
[09:45:29] <ProfSimm> causative_: the idea is you're not just a soup of cells each going about its individual business. There's a link between your cells, expressed not only in genes, but its entire structure, that causes the synchronisation of your cells to be more than the group of your cells
[09:45:54] <mycroftiv> profsimm: i think causative_ is really well informed on these ideas
[09:46:06] <causative_> or we could define "sum" in some dumb way that's by analogy to numeric addition, and then okay sure the whole is not this dumb kind of "sum"
[09:46:31] <causative_> but arranging physical objects isn't numeric addition anyway since the addends aren't numbers

[09:48:50] <mycroftiv> talking about a lego set and 'the whole' and 'the sum of the parts' is not a really dramatic leap into metaphorical strangeness
[09:48:55] <causative_> mycroftiv, the most reasonable way to define a "sum" of physical objects is to do it in a way that describes what actually happens when the two things are together
[09:49:07] <causative_> and in this most reasonable way, the whole by definition equals the sum of parts
[09:49:26] <mycroftiv> yeah the point is just the whole has behaviors the parts dont have
[09:49:32] <ProfSimm> causative_: and the purpose of these terms is to describe how microstates put together in a specific configuration produce effects different than adding up the individual effects of every part in isolation

[10:19:40] <causative_> there are different predictions - the game object, modeled only at a high level, can't do the things that a reductionist model could
[10:19:57] <Ungwelian> Instead of saying, "Frisk the steak about in the pan", using atomic models would require hundreds of billions of newtonian calculations just for moving your hand once.
[10:20:06] <Ungwelian> There's no sense in it.
[10:20:10] <mycroftiv> the development of artificial flavors for foods based on deeply detailed study of molecular chemistry and biology of taste has made a huge practical differencee to foods we eat
[10:20:31] <causative_> what's *really there*, and how we should *act* about what's there, are two different things Ungwelian
[10:20:52] <mycroftiv> but i still agree with Ungwlian that multiple levels of description are all 'real'
[10:20:53] <causative_> we can tell someone in a race, "run as if there's a bear chasing you."  And they do and they win.  Does that mean there was a bear chasing them?  No.
[10:21:00] <Ungwelian> I don't understand why you're so hell-bent on nullifying macroscopic reality, while at the same time being so obsessed about truth.
[10:21:11] <Ungwelian> As if macroscopic reality doesn't matter.
[10:21:18] <Ungwelian> While for human existence, it's what matters most.
[10:21:28] <causative_> well, same story:  "frisk the steak as if it was a discrete object not made of atoms."  And they do and it tastes good.  Does that mean the steak was a discrete object not made of atoms?  No.
[10:21:32] <mycroftiv> i just dont see why 'my atoms' are more real than 'my skin'
[10:21:52] <causative_> mycroftiv, you keep saying that and I keep giving you the same answer
[10:22:02] <mycroftiv> yes, leaky abstractions
[10:22:17] <causative_> no
[10:22:21] <Ungwelian> You don't see, causative_, that the abstractions are leaky relatively.
[10:22:22] <mycroftiv> and as i keep saying , i think this is not a problem if we are precise in our verbal indexing
[10:22:31] <causative_> mycroftiv, what I keep saying is stuff like this
[10:22:32] <causative_> <causative_>	the email is real
[10:22:51] <mycroftiv> causative_: then im not understanding what the disagreement is
[10:22:58] <causative_> <causative_>	the muscles are equally real as the atoms
[10:23:14] <mycroftiv> causative_: i apologize for the misunderstanding, your words you are quoting are indeed clear
[10:23:56] <mycroftiv> i feel other comments about truth and the general debate have some tension with aspects of this, there seems to be some kind of contention about what is real and how to describe it
[10:24:12] <Ungwelian> Another question is: why would size end at some level?
[10:24:50] <causative_> my position is that the steak is real, *but* its reality *reduces* to a collection of atoms, and the concept of the steak is a leaky abstraction of the atoms
[10:24:51] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: im trying to figure out what, if anything , we are actually debating
[10:25:12] <Ungwelian> At the end of the path, aren't mountains supposed to be seen as mountains, instead of not-mountains?
[10:25:26] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, it's very meta :P
[10:25:34] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: i think causative_ is saying, the mountains are indeed mountains

[10:26:13] <mycroftiv> i agree but it seems you also gain understanding as you fly higher and see more and more of the mountain range at once
[10:26:23] <causative_> yes, and I'm saying there are privileged levels of description, and lower levels are in theory more accurate than higher ones, even if they are harder to work with
[10:26:38] <mycroftiv> what about seeing everything all at once?
[10:26:38] <Ungwelian> He's also saying, smaller models are more accurate if all the consequences are worked out. And with truth as the goal, they should be worked out. Then, the result is most applicability.
[10:26:50] <mycroftiv> i often feel like i have the best view from a high place looking at the landscape
[10:27:04] <causative_> sure, it's useful to look at everything at once
[10:27:06] <mycroftiv> and i dont always want to get down and look at the magnifying glass
[10:27:19] <causative_> but we should remember that when we do that, the validity of our observations depends on how they reduce to the lower level
[10:27:22] <mycroftiv> sometimes i want to rocket up and look down at the planet as a whole and i learn a lot
[10:27:44] <mycroftiv> and i learn something new in fact from getting off the planet and seeing the blue marble, that pic is famous for a reason
[10:28:01] <mycroftiv> even though i could see all the details better, down on the surface
[10:28:39] <Ungwelian> Yes, for Heaven's sakes.

[10:30:45] <mycroftiv> its nice its all consistent
[10:31:13] <mycroftiv> the stuff that is big up close is small from far away and the perspective all lines up
[10:32:02] <causative_> it's well and good to look at things from a distance and a high level of abstraction, but the concept of grounding is also important
[10:32:24] <mycroftiv> 100% for sure, detailed facts are vital
[10:32:26] <Ungwelian> But trying to apply newtonian mechanics to cooking is not grounded at all.
[10:32:30] <causative_> if your high, abstract ideas aren't well-grounded in a lower level, then your ideas are empty
[10:33:04] <mycroftiv> thats right, it has to all connect up
[10:33:25] <causative_> the concept of grounding doesn't mean that you have to actually calculate everything at the lower level
[10:33:35] <causative_> it means that *in principle*, what you say at the higher level can be reduced to the lower one
[10:33:47] <causative_> everything you say about moving the steak around with the spatula, *in principle*, is about the atoms
[10:33:51] <Ungwelian> Of course you can reduce it. But why should you?
[10:33:53] <causative_> that's what grounds it

[10:34:27] <causative_> well, whether you take the explicit step of talking about the reduction is a separate matter
[10:34:31] <causative_> you don't have to do that, to ground it
[10:34:34] <causative_> you can, but it's not required
[10:34:49] <Ungwelian> And are the atoms really the ground, either?
[10:34:53] <causative_> what is required for grounding, is that it's understood how what you talk about at the higher level *can be* reduced
[10:34:59] <Ungwelian> Where does reduction end? Why would it end?
[10:35:03] <causative_> not that you actually do talk about how it's reduced
[10:35:07] <causative_> but that in principle it *can be*
[10:35:19] <causative_> and you know, in principle, how that would be done
[10:35:29] <causative_> it's like in mathematics, where we write proofs informally in paragraphs
[10:35:42] <causative_> but they are grounded by the fact that *in principle* we know how they would reduce to purely formal logic
[10:35:52] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: i think its important to note that reductionism in the scientific sense now involves universe-filling connective fields not just small point particles
[10:35:55] <Thilastiko> there is no ground. its an abyss
[10:36:04] <causative_> even if we don't bother to actually do that, if we wrote a "proof" where we *couldn't* see how to do that, it wouldn't be a valid proof

[10:37:06] <mycroftiv> the question of bounded or not is really interesting
[10:37:09] <causative_> why wouldn't it?  perhaps that's just how the universe is

[10:37:15] <causative_> you don't know, I don't know

[10:37:29] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: most things we experience are bounded. boundedness is a reasonable default expecctation
[10:37:31] <Ungwelian> With so much faith.
[10:37:41] <Thilastiko> pretending that everything is going to be explainable by the next, smaller more obscure thing is just fantasy
[10:37:44] <mycroftiv> but i agree things may be Actually Infinite
[10:37:51] <causative_> I haven't said one word about it ending
[10:37:59] <mycroftiv> ive mentioned large cardinals and their associated ultrafilters a lot
[10:38:01] <causative_> I've said it *may*
[10:38:10] <causative_> I haven't ever said it definitely *does*
[10:38:27] <Thilastiko> whether things are finite or not is entirely up to you
[10:38:29] <causative_> you're the one saying anything definite about it
[10:38:34] <causative_> the only one
[10:38:44] <Thilastiko> it al depends how you map numbers onto them
[10:38:45] <Ungwelian> causative_, you've been exactly looking at fundamental reality from reduction.
[10:38:50] <I_Am_M00t> don't say that with so much certainty causative_
[10:39:03] <causative_> Ungwelian, lower levels are more fundamental than higher levels
[10:39:10] <causative_> this is true regardless of whether there's a lowest level
[10:39:21] <I_Am_M00t> so?
[10:39:26] <causative_> because the high level abstractions are leaky, and what they leak into is the lower levels
[10:39:30] <Thilastiko> why? because good things come in small packages?
[10:39:38] <Ungwelian> <causative_> the blind man looking at the atoms is getting *all* the information, he just hasn't figured out all the consequences of it yet
[10:39:38] <Ungwelian> <causative_> but it's there in potential
[10:39:41] <Ungwelian> <causative_> the higher levels exist *too*, but they aren't *fundamental*
[10:39:44] <amigojapan> The apartment finiteness to quarks is probably do to limitations on our current technology
[10:40:02] <causative_> when your hamburger abstraction breaks down, e.g. because you tossed it in a fire, you have to start talking about molecules
[10:40:03] <I_Am_M00t> you can't explain higher levels with lower levels
[10:40:19] <I_Am_M00t> they're explain different phenomena
[10:40:22] <I_Am_M00t> they*
[10:41:03] <Ungwelian> I_Am_M00t, indeed.
[10:41:07] <causative_> well Ungwelian I obviously don't think that the atom level of description is literally all the information - I believe in physics, so you know I at least believe in subatomic particles.
[10:41:33] <causative_> so my statement that the blind man looking at the atoms is getting "all" the information must have been somewhat of an exaggeration, yes?
[10:41:37] <mycroftiv> i wish we could get some different predictions about observations of fact from these debates
[10:41:41] <causative_> all the information at the atomic level or above
[10:41:55] <causative_> but not information at the quark level or string level or loop quantum gravity level
[10:42:04] <Thilastiko> why are particles more fundamental than waves or fields?
[10:42:11] <Ungwelian> An exaggeration. I've thought you aim at accurate an honest conversation.
[10:42:17] <Ungwelian> *and
[10:42:20] <mycroftiv> it makes not much sense to me to argue about reductionism vs holism if it doesnt cash out to something actionable for our choices or measurements or something
[10:42:28] <causative_> use what you know about me to work out what I mean, Ungwelian
[10:42:44] <causative_> don't take everything completely literally
[10:42:59] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[10:42:59] <Ungwelian> So now truth is a personality issue?
[10:43:07] <causative_> perhaps I should have qualified it by saying that the guy looking at the atoms is only finding out all the information at or above the atom level
[10:43:15] <causative_> but it was intended to be implicit
[10:43:41] <amigojapan> Thilastiko: I don't think we can measure the foundation even if it does happen to be funnier

[10:44:54] <causative_> or I could say that if there are five blind guys, one looking at the elephant's tail, one at the elephant's foot, one at the elephant's trunk, one at the elephant's ears, and one at all the elephant's atoms... then the guy looking at all the elephant's atoms is getting all the information *that the other guys were getting*
[10:45:12] <Thilastiko> amigojapan: because our fingers are too thick?

[11:03:28] <mycroftiv> i get into the quasi-theological mystical infinite wholeness of reality aas an attitude/vibe but at the end of the day the stuff we can measure and communicate precisely is what -counts-
[11:03:38] <mycroftiv> and note the intentional overlap of meaning on 'counts'
[11:04:55] <mycroftiv> i mean our internal emotions and feelings are the most important thing to the world to us
[11:05:16] <mycroftiv> so i agree that pain in your foot right now is more serious than how many moons some planet in some other solar system has, to you
[11:06:28] <mycroftiv> but as someone like causative_ i think would point out, that foot pain as a subjective qualitative thing still resolves to atoms and you solve it probably with taking the shard of glass out of your foot before just meditating on it
[11:07:50] <causative_> I think non-reductionism is more of a reaction against the idea that science has the answers
[11:08:07] <mycroftiv> causative_: i agree its often emotional more than anything
[11:08:10] <I_Am_M00t> i don't understand what you mena mycroftiv , tbh
[11:08:19] <causative_> people endorse it because they don't like science

[11:08:44] <I_Am_M00t> i don't even know what you're trying to figure out, is what i mean
[11:09:05] <causative_> "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge"
[11:09:09] <I_Am_M00t> science is science, it isn't about thinking, but about measuring
[11:09:24] <I_Am_M00t> it's a web of knowledge about certain things
[11:09:28] <mycroftiv> science surely includes the process of thinking in its domain
[11:09:50] <causative_> of course, this is an unfair characterization for some who endorse non-reductionism
[11:10:01] <I_Am_M00t> every field of knowledge involves thinking
[11:10:04] <causative_> but I think it may apply to others
[11:10:31] <mycroftiv> i_am_m00t: i agree science is about measurement and predictions , what is a disagreement or unclarity?
[11:11:07] <causative_> reductionism brings with it a drive, a purpose, that we can understand things by breaking them into little pieces and studying the pieces and how they work together to produce the larger behavior
[11:11:20] <causative_> and I tend to see non-reductionism as an opposition to that drive
[11:11:27] <causative_> that's a very important drive that should not be opposed
[11:11:48] <mycroftiv> any process of trying to produce understanding from finding the facts seems worthy to me for sure
[11:11:52] <I_Am_M00t> i think the issue with science in philosophical discussions is that it completely misses the point
[11:12:01] <I_Am_M00t> it's not that science is wrong, it's that it doesn't really ask in first plac
[11:12:04] <I_Am_M00t> place*
[11:12:26] <I_Am_M00t> or rather, the things it asks about, are very delimited
[11:12:29] <mycroftiv> science asks and answers most  of the questions once regarded as purely philosophical
[11:12:36] <mycroftiv> and is working on many more
[11:12:37] <I_Am_M00t> well, not really
[11:12:40] <I_Am_M00t> it doesn't at all
[11:12:43] <mycroftiv> ok lets get speccific
[11:12:54] <I_Am_M00t> how do you know what's real?
[11:13:06] <mycroftiv> several ways and science is deeply important to that process
[11:13:13] <mycroftiv> 1st, i have perceptions
[11:13:26] <I_Am_M00t> how do you know what your perceptions actually are?
[11:13:27] <mycroftiv> 2nd, i believe in other minds and communicate with them
[11:13:42] <I_Am_M00t> look, there is a philosophy behind science
[11:13:42] <mycroftiv> 3rd, i can make measurements and use mathematics to operate on them
[11:13:51] <mycroftiv> absolutely yes
[11:13:53] <I_Am_M00t> that philosophy was not derived through science, but through thinking
[11:14:16] <mycroftiv> of course, we have to live in the universe and come up with the scientific method
[11:14:24] <mycroftiv> i dont see that as somehow separate from what science itself is
[11:14:26] <causative_> you can't draw a line between science and thinking
[11:14:32] <causative_> science is a way of thinking
[11:14:34] <I_Am_M00t> yes you can
[11:14:53] <I_Am_M00t> a lot of things are  away of thinking

[11:15:06] <mycroftiv> some people say logic and math are distinct, some say math is a part of logic, some say logic is a part of math. i dont see a factual issue here
[11:15:07] <I_Am_M00t> science is not "thinking", it's science.
[11:15:08] <causative_> yes, and you can't draw a line between those things and thinking, either
[11:15:27] <I_Am_M00t> yes you can
[11:15:39] <I_Am_M00t> they aren't thinking, they are fields of knowledge, or art, or whatever
[11:15:47] <causative_> that involve thinking
[11:15:55] <I_Am_M00t> yes, but they aren't thinking
[11:16:00] <I_Am_M00t> that's where you draw a line
[11:16:00] <causative_> thinking is a part of them
[11:16:10] <I_Am_M00t> they aren't thinking
[11:16:14] <I_Am_M00t> it's simple
[11:16:29] <mycroftiv> i have no idea what is being debated now
[11:16:40] <I_Am_M00t> me neither, he seems to agree, yet questions it
[11:17:01] <I_Am_M00t> poetry involves thinking, religion involves thinking, science involves thinking, math involves thining
[11:17:12] <I_Am_M00t> thinking is applied very broadly
[11:17:54] <I_Am_M00t> there's thought to cooking
[11:18:03] <causative_> scientists often have to think about science, to do science
[11:18:14] <I_Am_M00t> so what? :S
[11:18:20] <I_Am_M00t> it's not thinking, it's science
[11:18:23] <causative_> thinking about science is part of science
[11:18:28] <I_Am_M00t> thinking about X is part of X
[11:18:29] <causative_> no, it's science and it's also thinking
[11:18:36] <I_Am_M00t> no, it's only science
[11:18:38] <mycroftiv> earlier i said science answers many of the traditional questions of philosophy  and is working on more. you (i think) disagreed and id like to be more specific than thinking about thinking about thinking about science
[11:18:41] <causative_> the problem is with the phrase "it's not thinking, it's science"
[11:18:51] <I_Am_M00t> there's no problem with it, it's accurate
[11:19:19] <I_Am_M00t> you don't equate a field of knowledge or a tradition with the act of thinking
[11:19:29] <causative_> they aren't *equal* but there is *overlap
[11:19:37] <I_Am_M00t> there is no overlap
[11:19:40] <I_Am_M00t> thinking is *used*
[11:19:52] <mycroftiv> prescientifically philosophers or religion could just kind of say the stars in the sky were gods and meant this and that and if it rained, angry something,and fish meant something, and so forth
[11:20:01] <I_Am_M00t> it's a vehicle
[11:20:05] <mycroftiv> science completely changed how philosophy can address these issues
[11:20:14] <causative_> every intellectual endeavor is a kind of thinking
[11:20:19] <causative_> science is an intellectual endeavor
[11:20:27] <I_Am_M00t> it INVOLVES thinking
[11:20:32] <causative_> science is a kind of thinking
[11:20:35] <I_Am_M00t> it "isn't" thinking
[11:20:47] <causative_> your ontology isn't right
[11:21:03] <I_Am_M00t> it's very precise
[11:21:12] <I_Am_M00t> mycroftiv: isn't that kind of, the uninteresting philosophical questions though?
[11:21:21] <mycroftiv> not at all
[11:21:35] <causative_> what if you're Gregor Mendel and thinking about inheritance of traits, are you doing science?
[11:21:41] <causative_> yes you are
[11:21:45] <I_Am_M00t> mycroftiv: i mean, a lot of superstition has been replaced by scientific models, but essential philosophical questions, i don't see science touching them with a ten foot pole
[11:21:55] <mycroftiv> most of the questions about how the universe works and why im here and what it all means that i can think up, science helps me with
[11:22:02] <I_Am_M00t> science at its core rejects a lot of questions as invalid
[11:22:10] <causative_> Gregor Mendel's act of thinking about inheritance of traits was science
[11:22:12] <mycroftiv> examples please
[11:22:24] <I_Am_M00t> "why am i here"
[11:22:28] <I_Am_M00t> the one you just said
[11:22:32] <mycroftiv> science aswers that very well
[11:22:34] <I_Am_M00t> science doesn't give a damn
[11:22:39] <I_Am_M00t> no, it doesn't even attempt to
[11:22:47] <I_Am_M00t> it's not a scientifically valid question
[11:22:52] <mycroftiv> you are here because of this immensely detailed process of atoms being assembled that we can trace back to the big bang
[11:22:58] <I_Am_M00t> "how am i here" is what science answers
[11:22:58] *** Quits: Ashstar (~Ken@2600:1010:b023:8761:482:c2ff:fe6e:9d2e) (Read error: No route to host)
[11:23:16] <mycroftiv> do you mean 'what is my purpose in life'?
[11:23:20] <I_Am_M00t> there is no "why" in science
[11:23:25] <mycroftiv> science helps there too
[11:23:28] <I_Am_M00t> not really
[11:23:31] <causative_> "why" is an ambiguous question, and there are plenty of "whys" in science
[11:23:32] <mycroftiv> biological organisms are purposive
[11:23:44] <I_Am_M00t> science fundamentally rejects questions that concern human meaning
[11:23:44] <causative_> "why is the sky blue?" science has answers
[11:23:52] <mycroftiv> they exist because of the perhaps surprising mathematical possibility of self-reproducingstructures
[11:24:01] <I_Am_M00t> science fundamentally rejects questions that concern human meaning <--
[11:24:02] <causative_> "why does rain fall?" science has answers
[11:24:03] <mycroftiv> and life has by its nature this tendency to reproduce
[11:24:09] <mycroftiv> i dont think so
[11:24:15] <I_Am_M00t> i do think so, in fact, i know so
[11:24:19] <mycroftiv> i think thats a misunderstanding of science
[11:24:27] <I_Am_M00t> i think you misunderstand science
[11:24:30] <mycroftiv> many scientists research questions of deep human meaning
[11:24:44] <mycroftiv> psychology, social science, all these things, not just physics
[11:24:50] <I_Am_M00t> science investigates "cause and effect"
[11:25:06] <mycroftiv> i was just explaining how observed behavior of life as purposive information that engages in self-replication helps you understand the meaning of your life
[11:25:16] <causative_> it's too restrictive to say science only investigates cause and effect
[11:25:18] <I_Am_M00t> lol, you kidding?
[11:25:19] <mycroftiv> how do i decide what the meaning of my life is?
[11:25:24] <causative_> because science can also investigate systems that aren't causal
[11:25:29] <causative_> like closed timelike curves
[11:25:29] <I_Am_M00t> you want me to understand meaning by understanding bioogy?
[11:25:32] <I_Am_M00t> biology*
[11:25:35] <mycroftiv> i decided that reproducing information is clearly what science seems to tell me it is
[11:25:50] <mycroftiv> so i make music because it puts beautiful (i hope) information into the world
[11:26:18] <mycroftiv> this seems in harmony with what i learn from science about what my brain does and why
[11:26:34] <I_Am_M00t> wat
[11:26:41] <mycroftiv> i look at how the universe is put together mathematically
[11:26:51] <mycroftiv> and then figure out how my mathematical pattern is a part of that
[11:26:52] <I_Am_M00t> isn't it more accurate to say that you make music because you enjoy making music?
[11:26:59] <mycroftiv> and apply the principle of mathematical harmony
[11:27:06] <I_Am_M00t> wt
[11:27:10] <I_Am_M00t> wat*
[11:27:16] <mycroftiv> i enjoy making music because of scientific facts about my brain and biology and acoustics
[11:27:36] <mycroftiv> music is an acoustic phenomena pleasurable to humans for scientific reasons
[11:27:37] <I_Am_M00t> ... enjoyment is a subjective phenomena
[11:27:43] <mycroftiv> somewhat
[11:27:57] <I_Am_M00t> no, enjoyment is a human term, it's what you experience
[11:27:58] <mycroftiv> music is almost always nicer than broken glass stabbing my skin
[11:28:02] <causative_> science can study subjective phenomena, as it does in psychology and sociology
[11:28:07] <mycroftiv> and we can determine why scientifically
[11:28:18] <I_Am_M00t> well, whatever you determine scientifically is only a correlate
[11:28:22] <I_Am_M00t> it's not the phenomena itself
[11:28:25] <mycroftiv> we can understand scientifically why human animals have the behavior of producing music
[11:28:43] <causative_> science always measures "correlates"
[11:28:50] <I_Am_M00t> sorry, this is a problem here
[11:28:51] <causative_> you can say that about anything you do in science
[11:28:51] <mycroftiv> just like understanding why honey bees dance
[11:28:59] <I_Am_M00t> semantics get kind of important at some point
[11:29:12] *** Joins: HvszrStykp (~X@81.171.62.86)
[11:29:14] <I_Am_M00t> enjoyment is not a subjective phenomena
[11:29:14] <causative_> you can say you can't measure temperature, you can only measure the "correlate" of temperature which is what the thermometer reads
[11:29:21] <I_Am_M00t> you cannot you that you enjoy something because of a scientific formula
[11:29:29] <I_Am_M00t> cannot say*
[11:29:29] <mycroftiv> yes i can
[11:29:37] <I_Am_M00t> you can't, that's a belief you're repating
[11:29:39] <mycroftiv> i enjoy music exactly because of scientific formulas
[11:29:44] <causative_> but to measure the correlate of temperature *is the same as* to measure temperature
[11:29:44] <mycroftiv> and same with ice cream
[11:29:57] <I_Am_M00t> no, you use a belief about scientific formulas to explain something
[11:30:04] <mycroftiv> we have detailed understanding of how taste and ice cream work to make us think its delicious
[11:30:07] <I_Am_M00t> it's not sensible
[11:30:12] <mycroftiv> and why musical harmony is pleasing to the ear
[11:30:24] <I_Am_M00t> well, if that's what you think, then congrats
[11:30:37] <mycroftiv> i can explain why beethoven chose the notes he chose rather than some random bullshit and its because reality works in mathematically structured ways
[11:30:55] <I_Am_M00t> but that also means that you won't be able to grasp subtler concepts related to thought, because you stopped thinking the minute you saw a formula
[11:31:05] <mycroftiv> and i enjoy this as a biological creature and replicate the patterns in beethovens music andt his no different than any other animal behavior
[11:31:09] <mycroftiv> i did not stop thinkijng
[11:31:13] <I_Am_M00t> that formula btw, is used the same way a religious person uses scripture
[11:31:19] <mycroftiv> i cry listening to schumann's music
[11:31:20] <I_Am_M00t> you use science in a way it wasn't meant to be used
[11:31:34] <mycroftiv> science is meant to help us understand
[11:31:41] <I_Am_M00t> no, science is for building tools
[11:31:45] <I_Am_M00t> for practical purposes
[11:31:51] <mycroftiv> me understanding why i think music is beautiful using science is practical
[11:32:05] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[11:32:15] <mycroftiv> i perform music
[11:32:16] <I_Am_M00t> you can't just... ask yourself why you think music is beautiful?
[11:32:31] <mycroftiv> i do ask myself, and i learn the answer is its mathematical structure
[11:32:37] <I_Am_M00t> you have to refer to neuroscience?
[11:32:45] <mycroftiv> i have a brain so yeah
[11:32:50] <I_Am_M00t> do you?
[11:32:56] <mycroftiv> its made of atoms and neuroscience is how i understand how it works
[11:33:11] <mycroftiv> i play music because it is beautiful and i love it
[11:33:42] <I_Am_M00t> there you go
[11:33:45] <mycroftiv> and it is beautiful and i love it because i am a human biological animal and the universe has a complex mathematical structure and causal rules which means the structured vibrations of sound are pleasurable
[11:33:58] <mycroftiv> and this detailed scientific understanding is useful
[11:34:03] <I_Am_M00t> ok sure... but, i don't see why science is needed to explain why one likes music
[11:34:17] <mycroftiv> we build musical instruments and create tuning systems and compose music using math and science
[11:34:25] <I_Am_M00t> i'm sure 100 years ago people had perfectly valid answers as to why they liked music
[11:34:37] <I_Am_M00t> or 200 years ago
[11:34:43] <mycroftiv> if you are a purely intuitive listener or even performer, that doesnt remove the structure from existing
[11:35:04] <mycroftiv> physics still existed when you threw a ball even before humans could calculate the equations of newton
[11:35:25] <I_Am_M00t> well, not exactly. The thing physics tries to map existed
[11:35:38] <I_Am_M00t> physics itself is the models
[11:35:53] <mycroftiv> just verbal
[11:36:02] <I_Am_M00t> it's not just verbal, it's an important distinction
[11:36:16] <mycroftiv> ok lets stop and be super precise
[11:36:22] <I_Am_M00t> why?
[11:36:26] <mycroftiv> if i talk about 'the physics of how a ball moves'
[11:36:36] <mycroftiv> i am talking about what actually happens in the universe
[11:36:46] <mycroftiv> not the fact that some professor calculated it on pen and paper
[11:37:07] <mycroftiv> so yes the human practice of physics is distinguished from physics-as-what-actually-happens
[11:37:15] <mycroftiv> but when talk about physics
[11:37:23] <mycroftiv> we usually mean how the universe actually behaves
[11:37:27] <I_Am_M00t> "we"?
[11:37:30] <I_Am_M00t> i sure don't
[11:37:35] <I_Am_M00t> i mean physics
[11:37:38] <mycroftiv> standard language
[11:37:54] <I_Am_M00t> i'm not so sure most people mean that either, they may fool themselves and claim that they think that
[11:38:04] <I_Am_M00t> but most of them seem to refer to standard physics models taught in schools
[11:38:16] <mycroftiv> because those models describe how reality actually works
[11:38:22] <I_Am_M00t> uhm...
[11:38:26] <mycroftiv> they make accurate predictions
[11:38:53] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, when people say physics, they usually refer to the models taught in school, afaik
[11:39:34] <I_Am_M00t> the way many people think "the universe works" is in my experience according to what they were taught in school, basically
[11:39:44] <mycroftiv> yes because these things telescope into reality for most practical purposes
[11:39:44] <I_Am_M00t> high school physics, uni physics, some scifi movies
[11:40:17] <I_Am_M00t> well... either way, i think it's fair to make the distinction between what's taught, and "how it really is"
[11:40:26] <mycroftiv> i agree
[11:40:32] <mycroftiv> i always support verbal precision
[11:40:54] <mycroftiv> that was why i stopped and said 'lets get super precise'
[11:41:11] <I_Am_M00t> right, i thought you meant "let's stop being super precise", lol
[11:41:17] <mycroftiv> im very much on the 'lets argue about the disagreements of facts and methods'
[11:41:28] <mycroftiv> because so much philosophy does turn into verbal definitional disputes
[11:41:40] <mycroftiv> but all the maps are fine really
[11:41:47] <I_Am_M00t> yeah
[11:42:34] <mycroftiv> i think theres a lot of substantive issues of how reality works and what the meaning of life is and how we find out and what is good and harmful to do in action
[11:42:52] <mycroftiv> and to get to those philosophical questions you have to listen and agree to work mutually between maps
[11:43:02] <I_Am_M00t> yeah
[11:43:08] <mycroftiv> understand everyone has somewhat different verbal labels
[11:43:26] <I_Am_M00t> yeah ofc, i think it's fine, but that's also why you need to "stop" and define terms sometimes
[11:43:30] <I_Am_M00t> or translate terms
[11:43:36] <mycroftiv> so 'what can science' tell us is a really meaty one actually
[11:43:50] <mycroftiv> what scope of knowledge is measurable and quantitative and objective that we can all agree on
[11:44:08] <mycroftiv> i dont think necessarily everything is
[11:44:12] <I_Am_M00t> i mean, i'll use science to build a house, lol
[11:44:13] <mycroftiv> but wow the scope is huge when you dig in
[11:44:18] <I_Am_M00t> or get to the moon
[11:44:34] <mycroftiv> the music example is always fascinating
[11:44:43] <mycroftiv> people often use musical beauty as something non-scientific
[11:44:50] <mycroftiv> and then i go music theory berserk on them
[11:45:17] <mycroftiv> and i cant claim math tells me everything about how to make beautiful music
[11:45:29] <I_Am_M00t> do you consider math science?
[11:45:38] <mycroftiv> my best musical moments do come 'from the heart' and i dont have some formula for them
[11:46:04] <mycroftiv> math and science are distinct but deeply related in the practical pursuit of knowledge
[11:48:41] <I_Am_M00t> right, hmm
[11:50:16] <mycroftiv> also i think just being aware and perceiving and responding - this is obviously more fundamental and true than science
[11:50:31] <mycroftiv> and science does know this but often talks as if it doesnt
[11:51:09] <mycroftiv> there is definitely a slightly weird strand of science writing that seems to imply you should believe the physics textbook over your own eyes, even if your own eyes see the same thing many times in a row
[11:51:16] <I_Am_M00t> i mean, it's the gap between perception and science where you can't rely on science too much
[11:51:22] <I_Am_M00t> is where*
[11:51:28] <I_Am_M00t> that's all i mean really
[11:51:35] <I_Am_M00t> obviously you use science for practical purposes
[11:52:01] <mycroftiv> now, will we ever actually see the physics textbooks be wrong with our eyes? unlikely, but science is not a fixed authority that should cause us to disregard our own percpetual information
[11:53:08] <I_Am_M00t> look, science will never admit what you just said
[11:53:18] <mycroftiv> it does and will
[11:53:21] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[11:53:28] <mycroftiv> lol
[11:53:32] <I_Am_M00t> :P
[11:53:48] <I_Am_M00t> it is energized by the idea that it knows it all
[11:54:02] <mycroftiv> ah, this emotional thing
[11:54:03] <I_Am_M00t> the smallest doubt can ruin the whole picture
[11:54:11] <mycroftiv> sure scientists often have ego and stuff
[11:54:16] <I_Am_M00t> no no no , lol
[11:54:26] <I_Am_M00t> you just proclaimed i was being emotional
[11:54:30] <I_Am_M00t> i'll proclaim you're the emotional one
[11:54:32] <mycroftiv> but the scientific method relies on experimenters using their senses to collect data
[11:54:44] <I_Am_M00t> you emotionally through out that i was emotional
[11:54:46] <mycroftiv> so science does not and cannot deny this basic fact
[11:54:53] <I_Am_M00t> because you are in love with science, an emotional connection
[11:55:08] <I_Am_M00t> i am not in love with science, i merely respect it for practical matters
[11:55:09] <mycroftiv> wat
[11:55:23] <I_Am_M00t> "ah, this emotional thing" <-- what do you mean by that?
[11:56:00] <mycroftiv> I_Am_M00t → it is energized by the idea that it knows it all
[11:56:41] <mycroftiv> this, where you anthropomorphize science and try to indicate it is being too puffed-up
[11:56:47] <I_Am_M00t> well yes, there's a spirit behind science, "we will discover the truth about everything"
[11:57:01] <I_Am_M00t> so you're claiming i'm being emotional about it?
[11:57:10] <mycroftiv> that is emotional language
[11:57:30] <I_Am_M00t> i think you're being more emotional though, due to how invested you are in science
[11:57:30] <mycroftiv> it is part of what i would label as peoples emotional response to sciencece and attempt to deny its applicability
[11:57:38] <mycroftiv> ah see
[11:57:40] <mycroftiv> im a mystic
[11:57:40] <Ungwelian> Important not to forget that science is a social system, performed by humans.
[11:57:48] <I_Am_M00t> i mean, objectively, science cannot answer some questions
[11:57:49] <Ungwelian> There's no science that isn't done by humans.
[11:57:49] <mycroftiv> im a hippie tree hugger musician
[11:58:01] <I_Am_M00t> a person who wasn't emotionally attached to science would be able to admit that within a few sentences
[11:58:14] <mycroftiv> and so i am not a science lover. i am someone who was persuaded by reality i have no choice except to use this tool for understanding
[11:58:22] <I_Am_M00t> there's no need to list all the accomplishments of science
[11:58:33] <mycroftiv> i have no idea if science can answer all questions
[11:58:45] <mycroftiv> i mean certainly nothing can answer all questions
[11:58:52] <mycroftiv> we cant even calculate what turing machines will halt
[11:58:54] <I_Am_M00t> how about this: science doesn't even attempt to answer a certain category of question
[11:59:04] <I_Am_M00t> not only "can it not", it doesn't even pursue them
[11:59:11] <I_Am_M00t> so by design, it won't
[11:59:20] <mycroftiv> well that depends on definitional questions
[11:59:34] <mycroftiv> the social practice of science is more limited than its theoretical scope
[11:59:41] * arryana pushes cups of tea to pussipupu and lumine
[11:59:52] <I_Am_M00t> i think people often confuse science with something much broader
[11:59:57] <I_Am_M00t> "the search for knowledge"
[12:00:02] <mycroftiv> currently science actually pretends to not know about things it does know
[12:00:25] <I_Am_M00t> science isn't the search for knowledge, it's the search for certain types of knowledge
[12:00:26] <mycroftiv> well how do i search for knowledge that is reliable in a way this is not in some sense scientific
[12:01:18] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know, it's a question to think about i guess

[12:01:31] <I_Am_M00t> but, there exists questions that aren't of scientific concern
[12:01:34] <I_Am_M00t> valid questions

[12:09:48] <I_Am_M00t> there are valid questions outside of the scientific domain, as such you cannot explain everything with scientific concepts (like physical atoms), without making some dubious assumptions.

[14:45:35] <arryana> hm.
[14:46:03] <arryana> i suppose greatness will always be subjective to some extent, but in many cases it seems rather self definihg, doesn't it?

[14:54:01] <arryana> how do you define greatness?
[14:54:59] <Lumine> For my thinking, shooting to be socially great, is a symptom of certain inner conflict. it implies a lack of some kind. That you're not adequate as you are. And this vague idea of being great strikes me as completely on the side of self-esteem, or self-image.
[14:56:36] <Lumine> But we all need attention and validation to certain extent, so being recognized is not a bad thing necessarily. The problem is taking it to an extreme.
[14:56:43] <arryana> hm.
[14:58:01] <arryana> i think i see what you mean
[15:03:32] <Lumine> I think I found an ending thought for the piece, thanks to you
[15:03:57] <arryana> aw.  glad i could be of some use.
[15:12:49] <arryana> i think it's a bit of a slippery concept for me.
[15:13:20] <arryana> greatness comes in a lot of flavors, but it reminds me of the difference between the desire for 'mastery of' and 'mastery over'
[15:14:23] <arryana> being a master of digital art is a marvelous goal, in my eyes.  desiring or trying to gain mastery over someone or someones seems filthy to me.

[15:15:53] <arryana> greatness seems like much of the same scope to me.  the desire to do great things which will be of use or beauty is large scope, but worthy.  the desire to be seen as great or acclaimed for oneself also seems dirty to me.
[15:17:40] <arryana> one of my brothers has a lot of talent as an artist.  he also very much desires other people to admire him for it.  i remember when we were relatively young he was making fun of another kid's drawing (which was nowhere near as good as his own) and the teacher reprimanded him by saying, 'you'll know you're great when -other- people tell you so.  in the meantime, keep your ego in check'
[15:19:09] <Lumine> Well I agree, both with you and the teacher
[15:21:24] <Lumine> (gets coffee)
[15:25:13] <arryana> he was a great guy, and a great teacher.  even if he did have a tendency to break clipboards over his desk when he got annoyed with a student.
[15:33:03] <Lumine> That distinction you made reminded me of an old story, or rather, an ideal. How practical it is anyone's guess. But it states that if you want to be genuinely virtuous or great, it spoils the outcome. True virtue is like playing an instrument. Once you become too self-aware it affects your mode of playing. And so it is false virtue to try to force yourself into be perceived great. You earn that title through real accomplishments.
[15:35:58] <arryana> interesting.
[15:36:42] <arryana> i suppose my own views are deeply colored by the people i've admired
[15:40:02] <arryana> my paternal grandmother was one of them.  she was often mistaken for being a lot of things she wasn't because she had absolutely no desire for anyone's 'good opinion'.  an example of that sort of thing was that she had the whole family over to a huge lunch/dinner every two weeks.  since she'd have upwards of thirty people there, she'd go to all her neighbors that she knew were poor or
[15:40:02] <arryana> feeble with a prepared foil pan and say, 'i'm so sorry to impose, but could i please borrow your oven for an hour and a half, i have family coming and there's not enough room in my oven'.  before dinner she'd set aside an enormous amount of whatever she knew they liked best and afterward she'd take it to them and thank them profusely for their generosity in letting her use their ovens.
[15:40:25] <arryana> the parties, to her, were simply an excuse to feed half the old people in the neighborhood without shaming them.
[15:42:09] <arryana> similarly, when my brothers and i were kids she'd find some excuse to scream at us and send us to the walk in closet as 'punishment'.  what we knew and our parents didn't was that the closet was full of cookies, cold milk, cake, and our favorite homemade snacks.  our parents never would have let us chow down on all that stuff.
[15:42:54] <arryana> 'have you little bastards learned your lesson yet?'  (no, grandma, we're sorry, we'll be quiet and stay in here another half hour)
[15:43:04] <arryana> she was awesome.
[15:43:12] <Lumine> Wow
[15:43:19] <Lumine> That made me smile
[15:43:24] * arryana laughs
[15:43:35] <arryana> i'm glad.
[15:43:58] <arryana> but she never got a bit of credit for it, because everything she did avoided being noticed that way.
[15:44:49] <Lumine> That's funny because I was about to write the following quote as part of my paragraph: "Entering the forest they don't disturb a blade of grass."
[15:45:21] <Lumine> Ie. your grandmother
[15:45:22] <arryana> oh, she was hell on wheels.  she'd burn down the forest if that's what she thought was required.
[15:45:34] <Lumine> Haha
[15:45:36] <arryana> but she was a complicated person, too

[18:05:05] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: Internet is a perfect environment for someone to be cruel to someone else, unless they align 100%. It's what I find most disappointing about online forums and chats.
[18:06:17] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: essentially people approach online communication predatorially, not with intent to cooperate.
[18:07:41] <biys> interesting
[18:08:14] <biys> i would say it's weird to think that anyone ought to converse/be topical in a way that i think they should be
[18:08:39] <biys> who am i to be distating how peopel ought to interact?
[18:09:03] <biys> dictating beg your pardon
[18:09:38] <biys> i think it would be an indication of the ideas i have about myself in my mind
[18:09:47] <ProfSimm> biys: it's about how a person defines the goal of a conversation. If you define the goal of complementing your thoughts with someone else, and walking out smarter, you act one way. If you instead approach this more from an ego perspective, you're not trying to walk out smart, you wanna prove the other dude's an idiot, and you've been smarter all alone.
[18:09:48] <ProfSimm> along*
[18:09:52] <biys> where i feel as though it's acceptable for me to expect people to act in any particular way or another
[18:10:39] <ProfSimm> biys: in both cases you want to take something out of the conversation for yourself. But one is inclusive, and the other is exclusive.
[18:10:40] <biys> i'll give you an example, as i always do
[18:11:04] <ProfSimm> biys: it's sort of like the difference between symbiosis between two animals, vs. well one animal eating another
[18:11:05] <biys> if i grew up 8 mile detroit and you grew up beverly hills 90210, our ideas of what's normal would be significantly different based on our intersectionalities
[18:11:19] <biys> where i might wear a backwards ball cap and you might wear khakis and a polo
[18:11:37] <biys> that isn't to suggest that either of our perspectives about the world are inaccurate (because how can we relaly know?)
[18:13:17] <biys> you're suggesting that the goals that you feel are most admirable to strive for in a conversation are in some particular manner or another
[18:13:30] <biys> and you're establishing that those goals are most admirable as a matter of some kind of fact
[18:13:37] <biys> and that people ought to strive for those goals as well
[18:13:59] <biys> i'm thinking it's a strange understanding of the world to expect a same person to be motivated in much the same way you are
[18:14:16] <biys> s/same/diff/
[18:14:16] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: i'm thinking it's a strange understanding of the world to expect a diff person to be motivated in much the same way you are
[18:14:51] <biys> what is the original underpinning to the idea would you say?
[18:15:01] <biys> that a colaborative environemnt is the best?
[18:15:14] <biys> and the dictum "best" will transcend spaec and time?
[18:17:28] <biys> i do like the socratic method though

[21:16:02] <audrey> "What kind of man signs up for dismantling the patriarchy? What sort of woman embraces the red pill? Two types: the true believers in the creed, and those that were attracted by the generous sex ratio and the opportunities to exert mating choice power. It is very important for the true believers to tell the two apart, and the mechanism for doing so is exhaustive and exhausting virtue signaling."

[23:05:37] <audrey> inhahe_: I think part of the argument here is that there's much less need to virtue signal a certain set of values, if prospective mates don't espouse those values
[23:06:28] <inhahe_> probably true
[23:07:46] <audrey> if you're a straight woman and the men around you are "redpilled", then virtue signaling progressive values won't get you far
[23:08:04] <audrey> the idea is that people adapt to signal whatever prospective mates want to see

[23:34:04] <zicada> what are some philosophical points you enjoy besides gender ?
[23:34:30] <zicada> seems to be a lot of gender going on, on a philosophy channel
[23:36:57] <audrey> zicada, Existentialism, metaethics, mostly.
[23:37:43] <zicada> same, but also metaphysics
[23:38:28] <zicada> gender is arguably a part of metaethics
[23:40:30] <zicada> its broad. I don't mean to say i dont like talkling about gender or talking about it is bad etc. Also, IRC channels are going to amenable to people of eartly experience who show up and want to validate/dump etc this knowledge. Its going to be reactions to "modern wokeness" for the most part so..
[23:42:05] <iryith> I'm having an existential crisis, does that count?
[23:44:28] <zicada> it counts as exactly that i guess. If it helps, im sure we all have been having variations of those in the last 2 years
