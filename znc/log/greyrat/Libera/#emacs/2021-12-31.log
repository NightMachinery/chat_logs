[00:15:35] <bpalmer> Bayes: there are some studies around readability of text and 70ish is up there in terms of readability.
[00:15:36] <Bayes> which might be why I kinda dig wrapping lines around ~70 char when writing text (but use 80 for code)
[00:16:07] <Bayes> bpalmer yeah I'm not arguing for 60 or 70, like the exact value is kinda meaningless

[00:17:22] <bpalmer> I actually do hate rigid length limits on code lines -- my current workplace insists on 80 columns
[00:18:19] <bpalmer> which means there are a handful of locations where every single time someone edits a single parameter, the patch is spread across a huge number of lines (ruining version control 'blame'/'annotate') on basic formatting and obscuring what the actual change is

[00:19:17] <aidalgol> My workplace used to have a rule of "anything goes, because we all have wide-screen monitors now," but I successfully argued for a soft limit of 100 on the grounds that "yes, but it's nice to be able to use those wide monitors to view two files side-by-side."

[01:33:09] * madnificent can't refrain from commenting any longer
[01:33:15] <acdw> refrain not
[01:34:33] <madnificent> I also use exwm and it's great for a lot of reasons.  Except for the window placement.  For existing so long and having been able to pop up buffers for so long, I'm amazed at how much I strugle to get something sensible going.
[01:34:51] <madnificent> I'm very interested in finding approaches that others have taken to make that better.
[01:35:44] <artefact> i have a shortcut for split horizontal, split vertical. i use strict focus follows mouse and x windows fill the focused window
[01:36:28] <madnificent> To give an example: clicking on a folder in dired will try to open the new folder in a new window.  Hence there's a manual action to be taken.  Opening a terminal on a remote server when browsing to it doesn't open a new window.
[01:36:59] <madnificent> These get placed just about anywhere.  There's no "dump area" or anything like it to make sure things aren't getting messy.
[01:37:30] <artefact> you can rebind the click to dired alternate open? iirc that opens in the same buffer
[01:37:30] <artefact>  
[01:37:38] <artefact> that or play with display-buffer-alist
[01:37:41] <madnificent> A 32" 4k display certainly doesn't help in this department: there's ample space for many tiny tiny views.
[01:38:25] <madnificent> artefact: I know I can do that.  But I don't really know what a sensible approach is to be honest.  I also don't see myself tweaking that.  It would make the minor distraction an ever lasting one.
[01:38:39] <artefact> but yes, random things messing up my curated window layout is annoying. not everything follows display-buffer-alist, for example M-x man
[01:38:47] <madnificent> I'm hoping others have gone through a similar pain and I'm hoping for some package to provide some more sensible defaults for a bunch of them.
[01:38:55] <bpalmer> madnificent: rebind mouse-2 to dired-mouse-find-file rather than dired-mouse-find-file-other-window
[01:39:08] <bpalmer> madnificent: that way you keep a single window open to whatever directory you're considering.
[01:39:15] <jave> I'm trying org-latex-preview, for some math formulas, but the equations become rather small and hard to read, is there a knob to tweak for this?

[01:40:42] <bpalmer> display-buffer is not ... the simplest interface to understand.
[01:41:23] <theothornhill> madnificent: I don't use it myself, though.  I've succumbed to never understanding where anything ends up and teach myself how to switch buffers faster than light :)
[01:41:26] <madnificent> artefact: After 10 years of tiling window managers, I'm still interested to find what others have done to make things work for them.  Both i3 as well as xmonad bring interesting ideas to the table.

[01:43:16] <artefact> or "this x window doesn't have a close button, how do i close it again"
[01:43:23] <sm> this is unexpected: this line in my init.el breaks the arrow keys, causing them to insert ABCD instead of moving point:

[01:47:36] <madnificent> Somewhat better html support in emails would be a bonus too.
[01:47:43] <theothornhill> Is the discoverability poor?
[01:47:47] <madnificent> Another thing I absolutely love is having a consistent color scheme.
[01:48:18] <grym> theothornhill: there's just so much to discover
[01:48:47] <theothornhill> grym: Yeah, I try to never look
[01:48:51] <artefact> i think so. for example if you don't know M-z you won't find it by yourself, ever
[01:49:02] <madnificent> I agree on that part.  Perhaps we should focus more on the *-apropos and elisp for newcomers.  It's a barrier for many.

[04:26:10] <bpalmer> grym: not quite; although thou is certainly the intimate second person pronoun, german (and accordingly this germanic aspect of english) uses the plural second person pronoun addressed to a singular entity as a sign of respect.

[04:53:55] <bpalmer> sm: if you are in an emacs which has not yet loaded lisp-mode, indent-pp-sexp may not be defined. All (require 'lisp-mode) does is check if (featurep 'lisp-mode). If so, do nothing; if not, then it guesses there's a file "lisp-mode.el" ("lisp-mode.elc", "lisp-mode") somewhere in the load-path and tries to find it and evaluate its contents.
[04:54:49] <bpalmer> insert .gz as appropriate, I guess, although I'm not sure at what stage that's handled. 
[04:55:37] <sm> I just added the require to workgroups2.el and restarted emacs, it seems to be ok

For example, I'm pretty happy with the rate at which characters are typed if I hold down a key, but holding down M-f blasts it's way forwards a little more quickly than is ideal, same for C-n / C-p. What am I gonna have to learn to accomplish these sort of twewaks?

[09:41:55] <aidalgol> e.g. We are on a pseudonymous forum and I am trying to get your IP address to narrow down where you live, so I casually drop a link to an innocuous-looking page on a server I control, you visit it and see the silly cat picture or whatever, and you're none the wiser.
[09:42:27] <aidalgol> Now I know that you are probably somewhere in Victoria instead of just anywhere in the anglosphere.
[09:42:44] <aidalgol> I can now also try probing your router for vulns.
[09:42:58] <codingquark> Okay, first I will acquire 6 or 8 of f&b pencils and basic drawing pad right away. Then I will explore these newfangled tablets etc. Conceptually they sounds amazing, I don't have to worry about anything. All tools are software and can give way better freedom
[09:43:06] <aidalgol> There's got to be a more specific term than just "spear phishing" for that particular tactic.

[13:33:46] <kiki_lamb> twb: It doesn't seem like I could address this OS-wide: I'm happy with the key repeat rate for some things (like keys that just input characters in a buffer) but unhappy with the repeat rate for some emacs-specific bindings (like M-f/b and C-n/p).

[13:36:07] <twb> kiki_lamb: that seems like a weird thing to want.  I don't know any way to do that

[14:32:43] <twb> although if you discount all the dead and nearly-dead ones, I bet australia's count would only be like 50
[14:32:49] <twb> So handwave
[14:33:07] <bkhl> OTOH I've heard estimates like 40-50 language _families_ for pre-indoeuropean-migration Europe.
[14:33:13] <bkhl> So I guess it would be more like Ancient Europe.

[18:14:12] <rpav> that's basically just system() which is where it's painful
[18:14:20] <bpalmer> or, if you prefer perl and even more magic, https://metacpan.org/pod/Shell
[18:14:51] <artefact> probably not git-shell though. (its error message when invoked used to be funnier.)
[18:14:59] <rpav> i mean if i wanted that i'd just like exec("foo") in node heh
[18:15:15] <clemens3> shell (-scripting) is great for what it is
[18:15:37] <clemens3> no problem upgrading to a better language you need more than invokign a few things
[18:15:56] <bkhl> Switching scripting language won't do anything for various programs argument parsing though.
[18:16:02] <clemens3> shells can use all the sub commands of anything executable
[18:16:04] <bkhl> Unless you plan to write wrapper for all those commands in your shell.
[18:16:19] <rpav> bkhl: well, it will because most other languages have very nice argument parsing these days
[18:16:34] <bpalmer> rpav: well, for line in sh.run('mkdir foo && touch whatever.txt').output():   is a lot nicer API
[18:17:20] <rpav> yeah, maybe i should just look at a real scripting language
[18:17:24] <bkhl> I recommend the library Plumbum if you want to do shell-scripty stuff in Python.
[18:17:31] <bpalmer> rpav: a huge part of the common shells isn't that they're particularly powerful, it's just that they have a good workflow to avoid typing too much.
[18:17:37] <rpav> bash is just everywhere and easier to use if i don't want to build and/or can't install something
[18:17:43] <bpalmer> API design is the key.

[18:18:16] <rpav> well also that they exist everywhere .. e.g. i wrote an alternative to archive-tool in pure bash just because i can use it without having to install anything else 
[18:18:20] <bpalmer> oh, plumbum looks pretty nice.
[18:18:37] <bpalmer> If you had only written for sh/dash ...
[18:18:39] <rpav> artefact: yeah, but i'd rather use bash than either of those heh

[18:25:12] <bpalmer> the ideal password manager is integrated to the browser, so you're not susceptible to phishing (although possible also integrated with hardware tokens)

[19:50:12] <pingpongball> How can i do it in emacs?
[19:50:22] <pingpongball> both from evil mode and emacs mode?
[19:50:29] <rpav> numerous ways
[19:50:38] <twb> pingpongball: you can't.  Emacs isn't an IDE.
[19:50:43] <rpav> personally i have C-x w bound to a function that replaces the word at point with something you type
[19:51:04] <rpav> twb: 1) a dubious assertion and 2) not really relevant and 3) also not true
[19:51:17] <rpav> emacs very much "can do that" and you have a lot of choices how
[19:51:26] <twb> pingpongball: you'd have to install a language-specific framework that can actually understand the semantics, not just an approximation of the syntax.
[19:51:31] <pingpongball> yes i've already
[19:51:32] <rpav> in the above case it's a very simple string replace
[19:51:47] <pingpongball> i'm on doom, activated lsp mode, javascript, also multiple cursors and things
[19:51:49] <corwin> that screen-shot looks pretty much what I get from M-x query-replace ?
[19:52:04] <twb> rpav: er... AIUI they want to refactor all calls to Duck.fuck() method, but not other things that use the word "fuck"
[19:52:05] <rpav> pingpongball: multiple-cursors can also do that i believe, if you have a transient selection (i.e. "shift select")
[19:52:12] <rpav> twb: look closer
[19:53:00] <twb> If you just want to replace the word "fuck" everywhere, C-M-% \<fuck\> RET \<duck\> RET
[19:53:03] <rpav> but, if you _do_ have a language, and you _are_ using LSP, giving you some language comprehension, C-l r r will refactor/rename the thing at point
[19:53:40] <pingpongball> yes i can do so select likes m-% . / fuck/duck
[19:53:44] <rpav> probably the above is simple multiple-cursors selectin which emacs multiple cursors handles handily

[20:02:57] <rpav> e.g. i like some common things like C-v pasting, C-f searching, C-s saving, but a lot of emacs-isms like C-a/C-e/C-d

[22:30:07] <johnw> why what?

[22:30:48] <acdw> yeah for sure, i'm looking for that end ish
[22:30:58] <johnjaye> i'm guessing it's because the clicking sound and feel of clicking something makes the typing easier
[22:31:02] <rpav> just avoid corsair, their controllers are apparently shit and die :P
[22:31:12] <johnw> well, it took me a long time to realize that the low travel of those keys was accumulating impact stress on my fingers, and that was causing me nerve problems

[23:01:49] <grym> the standing part i can take or leave, but "this desk is exactly the right height" i snice 
[23:01:50] <johnw> the other neat thing about topre is that you can electrically modify the actuation distance, so you can configure it for super-light-touch (great for gaming, where mis-types don't matter so much), or touch-with-intention (better for accurate typing)
[23:02:32] <mwnaylor> The M570 is ok, currently using one now. I prefer the Logitech Trackman Marble. Actually prefer not using a pointing device if I can avoid it.
