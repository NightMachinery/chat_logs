[00:10:04] <ChrisM> Can someone help me fix this so that the stuff in the test string that is after the stuff highlighted in green is in its own capture group? https://regex101.com/r/PhCVy6/1

[00:41:03] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM no idea what you're doing but maybe you can work from here: https://regex101.com/r/PhCVy6/2
[00:42:01] <JohnDoe2> you can add " ?" before the second (capture group) if you don't want the space captured
[00:42:54] <ChrisM> Basically in that example I am trying to get Counterattack in a group by itself
[00:43:13] <ChrisM> I should be able to figure out the rest from there
[00:44:07] <ChrisM> But Counterattack can be anything 
[00:45:42] <ChrisM> Maybe this would be easier... I have this working how I want but it only works if the string includes a percentage in parentheses...  https://regex101.com/r/Vd03U8/1
[00:45:59] <ChrisM> I need it to work when there is not a percentage in parentheses as well
[01:47:38] <ChrisM> Can somebody help me fix this so AOE is in its own group, instead of being included in group 28? https://regex101.com/r/4vjD3C/1

[16:06:50] <digitok> hehe
[16:07:16] <Zsolt> :(
[16:07:26] <digitok> lol
[16:07:59] <Zsolt> inside <function all the function names (with storage class, return type, etc.) in the file are parsed. In the <functionName> all these parsed func. names are displayed in a list/window
[16:08:05] <Zsolt> what?
[16:08:33] <Zsolt> problems?
[16:08:38] <digitok> no
[16:09:09] <Zsolt> the problem is
[16:09:11] <digitok> was just laughing at your sad face
[16:09:20] <Zsolt> :))
[16:10:22] <Zsolt> there are exclusions in the <function> part of the code for C keywords ...
[16:11:09] <Zsolt> but these exclusions are not working because the keywords are excluded, but what follows afterward  is not excluded
[16:11:11] <Zsolt> so
[16:11:48] <Zsolt> e.g. declaring: while(WaitFor()){}
[16:12:13] <Zsolt> will show in Notepad++ function list as function name: WaitFor()
[16:12:32] <Zsolt> but that is a bug because while(WaitFor()){} is not a function definition!!
[16:12:44] <digitok> i see
[16:12:57] <Zsolt> this is my problem, and it is very very annoying
[16:14:05] <Zsolt> digitok: what I found is: the keywords are excluded, like while, long, goto etc., but what follows those keywords is not excluded
[16:14:22] <digitok> right
[16:14:31] <Zsolt> is should be something like: everything after a C keyword should be ignored, excluded
[16:14:50] <Zsolt> and I don't know how do I do that  in xml
[16:15:01] <digitok> in your actual code, you have 07(?&VALID_ID) and not 14(?&amp;VALID_ID) like in the paste i assume?
[16:15:18] <digitok> i assume the pastebin did that

[16:27:54] <digitok> army, it should work. you can see if changing / to \/ fixes it
[16:28:09] <digitok> unless "regex" doesn't allow spaces
[16:28:33] <army> yes
[16:28:34] <digitok> if that's the case, you'd need to change " " to \s
[16:28:37] <army> withou spaces
[16:28:44] <army> dont need spaces
[16:28:50] <army> remove space 
[16:29:05] <digitok> change the spaces to \s
[16:29:16] <digitok> Mibbit@\S*\s\*\shttp://mibbit\.com
[16:30:06] <army> this // is patern error
[16:30:28] <digitok> Mibbit@\S*\s\*\shttp:\/\/mibbit\.com
[16:30:36] <Zsolt> I give up
[16:30:43] <digitok> why
[16:31:00] <digitok> we're doing so good
[16:32:50] <army> this is match now https://regex101.com/r/RR3Uw6/1
[16:32:52] <army> thx
[16:32:55] <army> again
[16:33:06] <digitok> yw
[16:33:08] <Zsolt> because, I know only a few things. I know only that notepad++ uses that file to show me my function defines in a window (called Function List). I need to edit that xml (actually is called c.xml) in order to fix the issue. What I actually do is, editing that file, restarting notepad++ so see the effects
[16:33:19] <Zsolt> I don't know more
[16:33:26] <digitok> army, the // shouldn't be an error in your ircd
[16:33:29] <digitok> that's an re101 thing
[16:33:35] <digitok> that's why i didn't escape them
[16:34:08] <Zsolt> I'm not a nxml developer, nor I know regex
[16:34:20] <Zsolt> so I'm out of ideas
[16:34:20] <digitok> do you know C
[16:34:41] <Zsolt> C, yes, but this has nothing ot do with C
[16:34:51] <digitok> of course it does
[16:35:19] <digitok> where are your function defines coming from
[16:35:21] <digitok> what language
[16:35:54] <Zsolt> from C, but this is xml script, not C!
[16:36:12] <digitok> the issue with regex has nothing to do with xml
[16:36:20] <digitok> the regex matches C function defines
[16:36:26] <digitok> i need examples of C function defines
[16:36:35] <Zsolt> OK
[16:36:56] <digitok> so what i'm asking for is an example of a line of C code that should match every part of this regex
[16:37:11] <digitok> meaning type_qualifier, delcarator, pointer, etc
[16:38:03] <army> digitok: yes nice thx bro
[16:38:08] <digitok> np
[16:38:33] <Zsolt> <storage class specifier> <type specifier> <function name>(<0 or more argmunents>){<function body>}
[16:38:36] <Zsolt> e.g.
[16:39:02] <Zsolt> static int myfunc(int arg){ return 0; }
[16:39:17] <Zsolt> this is a valid example
[16:39:24] <Zsolt> an invalid example is
[16:39:44] <digitok> the regex says a type qualifier is const or volatile
[16:40:45] <Zsolt> sorry, right:  static const int myfunc(int arg){ return 0; }
[16:40:56] <Zsolt> this is a valid define
[16:41:01] <Zsolt> now an invalid one
[16:41:16] <Zsolt> static const switch myfunc(int arg){ return 0; }
[16:41:48] <Zsolt> this is invalid because switch is statement keyword it is not a type specifier
[16:42:06] <Zsolt> so the second example will fail to compile
[16:42:26] <Zsolt> but the xml tell that this is also a valid function

[17:20:00] <Zsolt> digitok: it was difficult to me to
[17:25:57] <digitok> i'm not sure what to do
[17:26:00] <digitok> you can't use lookbehinds
[17:26:56] <digitok> and the type qualifier itself is a keyword
[17:26:59] <digitok> const
[17:29:21] <Zsolt> OK
[17:32:07] <purplex> what are you are trying to do, zsoft
[17:33:40] <digitok> here's what i was working with https://regex101.com/r/Ue2WgU/1
[17:34:23] <digitok> he wants to exclude matches that contain keywords from the list inside the negative lookahead inside (?'VALID_ID'
[17:34:38] <digitok> but as you see on lines 2 and 4 it just starts matching after those words
[17:34:54] <digitok> because a function without any words before it is also valid
[17:35:28] <digitok> but "const" is valid in the context of lines 1 and 3
[17:35:39] <digitok> but not valid somewhere else
[17:35:47] <digitok> lol
[17:35:55] <digitok> it's definitely an OnlineCop cop
[17:36:04] <digitok> it has /x and everything
[17:36:20] <digitok> s/cop/job/
[17:36:21] <rebot> 14digitok meant: it's definitely an OnlineCop 07job
[17:38:00] <purplex> 85struct test const int smells like a wrong syntax
[17:38:52] <purplex> struct keyword in C creates a structure, but used before declaring a function
[17:39:26] <purplex> 84static const switch myfunc(int arg){ return 0; } is right
[17:40:07] <purplex> return type: static const of type 'switch' datatype, function name: myfunc with args and function body 
[17:43:05] <digitok> the first line i made up
[17:43:14] <digitok> :D
[17:43:37] <purplex> then it must be right :p
[17:43:43] <digitok> the issue is we can't use lookbehinds
[17:43:59] <digitok> so it'd need to be done using skip fail
[17:44:44] <digitok> but since const is both valid and invalid
[17:44:47] <digitok> i'm not sure how
[17:44:47] <purplex> the sacred syntax to gain control of regex engine
[17:45:23] <purplex> yep im not sure of it either since recursion and code parser wasn't in my interest

[17:59:13] <Me-me> No, happy to help isn't coming. Coz whenever digitok asks me for help with regex it's because (a) he plans on doing it himself and showing me up by finishing before me, or (b) he believes it to be impossible and likes to validate his poor opinion of me by proving that I can't do it either.
[17:59:34] <digitok> eh
[17:59:41] <digitok> the first one is bs
[17:59:52] <digitok> and the second one is bs
[18:00:26] <digitok> not sure why you think i have a poor opinion of you
[18:01:03] <digitok> and i don't think it's impossible, i'm just doing other stuff and it's not something straightforward
[18:01:57] <digitok> more importantly, i'm offended that you think both of those things are true
[18:02:03] <digitok> but good to know i suppose
[18:03:31] <Me-me> Let's take it to the other channel.
[18:06:38] <Zsolt> digitok: nothing, it is fine, thank for your help
[18:08:18] <Zsolt> digitok: did you rewrote the script parts?
[18:08:31] <Me-me> He posted that last one for my benefit.
[18:09:00] <Zsolt> so it is not for me, right?
[18:10:03] <Me-me> Right. It's the same as the previous link just with less indents.
[18:10:59] <Zsolt> ok
[18:12:11] <Me-me> Is there a reason we can't just prepend and append ^ and $ ?
[18:12:45] <Me-me> Or just the ^ with multiline, that is?
[18:13:46] <digitok> i think it still needs to match within actual code
[18:13:58] <digitok> but i don't know tbh
[18:14:42] <Zsolt> someone of you is using Windows?
[18:14:42] <digitok> Zsolt is the regex matching against large amounts of code? or just something like <this is a single function definition to be validated>
[18:14:54] <digitok> purplex uses np++
[18:15:17] <Zsolt> digitok: larg amount
[18:15:21] <Zsolt> *large
[18:15:33] <digitok> that's unfortunate :p
[18:15:54] <digitok> but seriously, OnlineCop does this kind of parsing all the time
[18:15:55] <Zsolt> you can install np++ and check the c.xml file
[18:15:58] <digitok> too bad he's not here
[18:16:46] <digitok> maybe if you can hang around for a while he'll be online at some point

[18:20:02] <digitok> not sure which i prefer :p
[18:41:50] <Me-me> Well I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.
[18:42:06] <Zsolt> he is actually a cop?
[18:50:18] <Me-me> Zsoft: Is it possible to get these functions in a greater context? Is there any commonality to what's before them?

[21:08:30] <JohnDoe2> re101-eel-7 match is everything that is going to be returned by the regex, while group is a selected part of that whole match
[21:08:50] <JohnDoe2> so whatever you wish to be captured of the match needs to be inside ( ... )
[21:09:20] <JohnDoe2> if you want the whole thing captured (although it's redundant since the whole match already has that), just move your ( before \. to the beginning of the regex
[21:12:56] <re101-eel-7> Oh. Got it. Thank you JohnDoe2. In python3 how to find all matches? re.findall returns list of all groups.
[21:13:31] <JohnDoe2> I don't play around with py regularly, I forget. But click the codegen link on the left sidebar - it should give you an idea
