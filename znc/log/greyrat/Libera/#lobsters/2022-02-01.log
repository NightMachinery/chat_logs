[23:52:57] <JordiGH> Hm, trying to QR decode my birth certificate.
[23:53:09] <JordiGH> It's obviously base64 encoded, that was the first step.
[23:53:18] <JordiGH> The result has most of the strings in my birth certificate.
[23:53:22] <JordiGH> But there's also lots of binary in there.
[23:53:26] <JordiGH> file(1) can't tell what it is.
[23:53:41] <companion_cube> bsandro: is it harder to get a decent understanding of Go's runtime/GC, than to master C++? I don't think it's obviously the case :)
[23:56:37] <bsandro> companion_cube: yeah, it is not; I just mean it is a big "layer down there"
[23:57:15] <companion_cube> for Go I don't think it's _that_ big (depending on your domain of application, of course)
[23:57:30] <companion_cube> for C#, a bit bigger. But I doubt you can be as productive with C++ as someone using C#
[23:57:36] <companion_cube> when C# fits the bill
[23:58:15] <bsandro> honestly I thought the same (about productivity with c++) but every single time I got proven otherwise
[23:59:23] <bsandro> and I don't even like c++ that much to be fair :D
[23:59:56] <JordiGH> Man, what is this stuff: https://pastebin.com/Tqt62AW4
