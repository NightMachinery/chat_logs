[00:35:56] <sney> but there is also some logic to change that setting via debconf based on what is detected in the existing config, if I'm reading this right: https://salsa.debian.org/ssh-team/openssh/-/blob/debian/1%258.4p1-5/debian/openssh-server.config
[00:35:56] <rawtaz> this is extremely weird then
[00:36:45] <rawtaz> you see, before settling on the "use package mantainers version", i ttried the three-way merge. it experienced conflicts, and created the following (snippet from) sshd_config.merge-error file: https://kopy.io/O3nZF

[00:37:45] <rawtaz> total mystery then
[00:38:01] <sney> and debconf shouldn't have flagged '#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password' as a change because it's the default

[00:40:06] <rawtaz> sney: i had a line at the very end of the file, in my old file, which caused it to flag i think. but the only merge conflict when i attempted the merge was that line we discuss above.
[00:41:02] <rawtaz> PMT: it's simply the .merge-error file produced by whatever the upgrade runs :D but yeah i get that you cant know exactly what that was. i can only tell you it was from the very latest buster (all up to date) to bullseye after changing to bullseye in the sources.list files.
[00:41:12] <rawtaz> tomreyn: thanks, doing so now :)

[00:43:48] <rawtaz> tomreyn: here's the output of those: https://kopy.io/zg8XD
[00:44:49] <rawtaz> PMT: hm i didnt see tomreyn writing about debconf-get-selections . can you point me to what they said?
[00:45:41] <tomreyn> rawtaz: so you have permit-root-login set to "false" in debconf, which deviates from the default value of "true"
[00:46:31] <PMT> oh, sorry, they said debconf-show, but
[00:46:38] <tomreyn> rawtaz: you don't have debsums installed, so checking which package files have been modified is not possible.
[00:46:57] <PMT> shrug, so much for that
[00:47:11] <tomreyn> but i'm not actually sure we're much wiser now
[00:48:09] <rawtaz> tomreyn: sorry if im dense here but.. if i have permit-root-login false in debconf, then why would the sshd_config thing in the update of the package try to put  PermitRootLogin yes  in the file and remove the old  #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password  ?
[00:49:00] <rawtaz> if anything, a false value for that setting would presumably result in e.g.  #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password  which is what was *removed*/replaced in the upgrade
[00:50:34] <tomreyn> rawtaz: i agree. i have no explanation for what you're saying has happened.

[00:54:42] <sney> indeed, it seems you managed to confuse debconf enough to get the opposite result somehow, but that's not exactly new information, just the original question restated
[00:54:46] <sney> good thing you caught it, at least
[00:54:49] <rawtaz> on an upgrade-related note, there was a bunch of warnings about not being able to remove folders because they were empty. e.g things like /etc/calendar (which seems to contain one file named "default"). is there some way to clean stuff like that up, or should i grab some log from the upgrade and do it manually?

[01:00:01] <sney> debconf is the apt subprocess that asks you about configuration changes
[01:00:23] <sney> it would have been hooked by one of the package scripts, probably postinst

[02:14:47] <rawtaz> dude(tte)s! i love debian. i went back to see if i could find logs containing them warnings about not being able to delete various folders during the upgrade. and sure enough i found the /var/log/apt/term.1.gz log with it.
[02:15:35] <rawtaz> not to mention that after reinstalling some header packages the zfs kernel modules started building without me having to tell apt to do so, and after htat i could get zfs running again.
[02:15:45] <rawtaz> its nice when things work isnt it :P

[02:17:25] <somiaj> make sure you install the linux-headers meta package, so you odn' thave to manually install th eheaders each kernel change
[02:19:15] <rawtaz> hm interesting. i have followed the instructions at https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Debian/index.html#installation which means im using  apt install dpkg-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r) linux-image-amd64
[02:19:31] <rawtaz> youre saying ditch the  -$(uname -r)  part i take it?
[02:19:43] <somiaj> linux-headers-amd64 will be the meta package
[02:19:55] <somiaj> that will automatically pull in nw headers
[02:20:09] <rawtaz> i see. thats a good tip. i wonder why they dont have that in the instructions :(
[02:20:48] <rawtaz> i still need the other two though right?
[02:21:32] <sney> yeah that's odd particularly since they do say to install linux-image-amd64
[02:21:40] <sney> I don't think I've ever had to install dpkg-dev manually
[02:22:12] <rawtaz> gotcha. thanks, i appreciate things that are in line with having proper and clean setup instructions :L)
[02:22:15] <rawtaz> :)*
[02:22:40] <sney> yeah, dpkg-dev is a dependency of dkms, which zfs-dkms also depends on
[02:22:56] <sney> maybe those instructions are just making sure? idk
[02:23:33] <rawtaz> maybe. its also very likely that they have evolved from older versions of the instructions and the one updating the article hasnt been sure etc so they just change parts but dont entirely clean it up

[02:45:18] <sney> if so, that would indicate that the driver is ok and the device is detected.
[02:45:24] <sney> the next step would be to make sure it isn't muted.

[02:46:36] <n4dir> i don't know why they ask you to use that script, instead of just arecord -l; perhaps it is just formatted better.
[02:47:01] <sney> probably formatted so the DAW can parse it better

[06:23:30] <sussudio> why do you feel the need to kill random processes
[06:26:49] <brentaarnold> sussudio: using WSL2 with Debian there is no systemctl, which I usually use, but instead I use pkill because I have a lack of knowledge of the OS.
[06:26:57] <brentaarnold> If there's a better way please do
[06:27:22] <gry> so 'to close wsl2' ?
[06:27:30] <gry> or what are you closing
[06:27:40] <gry> or you're closing an individual process inside wsl2
[06:27:47] <brentaarnold> Sorry, to close something such as weechat inside of WSL2
[06:27:56] <gry> in weechat you can write '/quit'
[06:28:13] <brentaarnold> I'm sorry
[06:28:22] <brentaarnold> I should clarify
[06:28:28] <brentaarnold> I used it to close znc
[06:28:29] *** Quits: kirk781 (~doors_1@2402:3a80:b57:ddf6:ce4a:6380:5f6:fad8) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:28:34] <brentaarnold> using ssh
[06:28:40] <brentaarnold> with a VM that had full systemctl
[06:28:46] <brentaarnold> SO I'm really not sure why I pkilled it
[06:29:14] <sney> usually there's a 'service' alias that talks to whatever init system, like 'service apache2 restart' will work on a system with systemd or sysv or a few other things
[06:29:25] <gry> brentaarnold, znc can be shutdown with '/msg *status shutdown'
[06:29:44] <sney> but wsl2 "not having systemctl" sounds more like path issues
[06:30:04] <brentaarnold> gry: Thank you, I'm absolutely positive that's in the documentation somewhere towards the top but I hero'd it and didn't spend the time.
[06:30:23] <gry> that's ok, if you find other apps like that, someone'd be happy to tell you how to close them :)
[06:31:17] <brentaarnold> sney: I think WSL1 has access to ttyUSB, but WSL2 doesn't, but has other functionality that makes it appealing for multiple instances, I believe.
[06:31:28] <brentaarnold> But either way both are incomplete attempts
[06:32:14] <brentaarnold> Hopefully WSL3 will be able to run a more complete kernel, if I'm using terminology correctly
[06:32:21] <brentaarnold> I'm afraid I'm butchering it
[06:34:07] <brentaarnold> If WSL3 could use serial and be efficient I'd use it instead of VMWare Workstation 16 with Debian 11, which to be damn honest I still ain't sure is the right solution.
[06:34:15] <brentaarnold> I am labbing a lot of hardware right now
[06:34:48] <brentaarnold> Debian 11 with VMWare running W10 Pro*
[06:35:13] <sney> I don't have any windows systems going atm so I'm probably a little out of touch, but whatever wsl is emulating must have *some* kind of an init system telling it what to start in order to have a somewhat complete linux environment to log into and run applications
[06:35:32] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[06:35:46] <sney> usually in debian (since debian 8), this is systemd, which is controlled by the tool systemctl. I guess it could be something else, but it seems more likely that you're missing something in your environment specifically
[06:36:08] <brentaarnold> right
[06:36:27] <brentaarnold> Well it's offical that WSL2 doesn't support TTYUSBX
[06:36:31] <brentaarnold> So that settles that
[06:36:40] <brentaarnold> But I think minicom with Debian 11
[06:36:44] <brentaarnold> what more do you need
[06:37:08] <sney> dealing with hardware devices from a vm guest has always been slightly hairy
[06:37:35] *** Quits: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[06:37:53] <sney> anyway, you should look at the docs for wsl2 and find out what the init system is, and what its limitations are and how to use it, because sometimes you won't be able to poke znc from a dialog. or whatever service you need to start/restart/stop.
[06:38:48] <brentaarnold> It doesn't use systemctl, but there is some kind of work around you can install to get systemctl running. I just want things to be as OS vanilla as possible.
[06:40:39] <brentaarnold> For the host OS, that is, not the guest OS.

[07:09:50] <sney> does 'service' work to control whatever init system it does have?
[07:09:52] <brentaarnold> PMT: WSL3 is the answer to everything bro, Windows 11 dawg
[07:10:30] <PMT> Windows 11 is still WSL2. :P

[07:11:12] <sney> nice, good to confirm.
[07:11:21] <PMT> (Unless they changed something since the last time I looked.)
[07:13:02] <brentaarnold> PMT: I keep hearing W11 is just another wrapper
[07:13:07] <brentaarnold> So I'm sure it's WSL2
[07:13:28] <PMT> brentaarnold: oh, I'm certain it's WSL2, I just meant service works unless it changed.
[07:13:38] <brentaarnold> gotcha
[07:13:40] <PMT> (Though they did add the clever WSLg stuff for GUI apps.)
[07:13:46] <brentaarnold> oh nice

[13:54:20] <bdax> Hello, for the wordpress package it lists a dependency 'on apache2 or httpd', where httpd is a virtual package which can be fulfilled by various other servers, including lighttpd which is the one I'm interested in. How can I tell apt to 'install wordpress but don't use apache2, use lighttpd'?

[13:57:42] <at0m> bdax: apt install lighttpd ; apt install wordpress ? or sort out the depends and recommends in aptitude's ncurses interface
[13:58:24] <bdax> well, well installing lighttpd first doesn't stop the second installing apache2, but I'll try aptitude now
[13:59:00] <ansgar> bdax: You also need to do the same for "libapache2-mod-php | php"
[13:59:08] <at0m> personally i find the ncurses UI easier to sort out such, hand-pick recommends etc

[18:31:36] <PMT> I guess they just bumped the point release when they reverted a patch rather than adding a debian-specific suffix, which seems like the wrong thing to have done.
[18:31:45] <Cool_Fire> But 2.7.5 and 2.7.6 literally don't exist
