[02:59:45] <makomo> Spawns_Carpeting: regarding customizable vs. "plain" variables: customizable variables can have functions that are run once they're set. a lot of the time they don't, so just setq-ing them is fine, but sometimes they do, and in that case you'll want to use the customize interface to set them
[03:01:48] <irek> Spawns_Carpeting: as far as I know if you want to enable minor-mode globally then you need to enable global version of that mode.  I don't see `global-save-place-mode' tho.  But it's easy to create global mode from any minor mode.
[03:02:16] <makomo> i suppose that technically, whether or not a custom variable has a "hook" like that should be an implementation detail and you should always use the customize interface to set them, but from what i've seen people use defcustom even when the variable will surely never have such a hook, just to make use of the customize machinery (the types and the nice listing in Customize)
[03:02:50] <makomo> that's why i think sometimes just setq-ing them is fine enough, if you know that the intended usage of the variable is just to be a "plain" variable

[05:11:48] <Wafficus> I have to use '--project' for gcloud compute ssh, and the final bit has to be '-cli'
[05:11:56] <Viking667> twb: hm?
[05:11:57] <Wafficus> if anyone here uses GCP with Tramp, please enlighten me
[05:12:08] <twb> Wafficus: GCP is some google thing?
[05:12:10] <Wafficus> glad to share my config too
[05:12:15] <Wafficus> yeah its basically an AWS rip off

[05:12:27] <twb> Ah I've been calling that "gcloud"
[05:12:28] <Wafficus> my work uses it to deploy jumpboxes as a means to enter before going into a CentOS box
[05:12:42] <twb> Wafficus: so you just want ssh -J ?
[05:12:54] <Wafficus> not sure, haven't tried that, would that work in that scenario?

[05:13:47] <twb> If that works for you, bake it into ~/.ssh/config and then tramp will automatically use it
[05:14:16] <Wafficus> basically this is the format of the command I need:
[05:14:16] <twb> This is asuming OpenSSH
[05:14:17] <Wafficus> gcloud compute ssh --project ops-dist-(client's environment name) (client's environment name)-cli
[05:14:24] <Wafficus> that's what I use for work all the time
[05:14:29] <twb> "gcloud compute ssh" is an actual command?
[05:14:42] <Wafficus> but to do that for tramp, I have zero clue and legit, feel like I'm a caveman
[05:14:59] <twb> Sounds like google are choosing to use non-standard protocols
[05:15:01] <Wafficus> yep twb
[05:15:18] <twb> gcloud isn't even part of my OS so I have no fucking clue how that would work
[05:15:37] <twb> You probably want to add something to tramp-methods
[05:15:38] <Wafficus> I want to blow people's minds with Emacs, but half of the time I have to resort to just using ansi-term, and using Vim on the end box is just eh
[05:15:59] <Wafficus> I'm also kind of disappointed with most terminals on MacOSX as they're not like xterm or urxvt standards with Emacs standard keybindings for Bash

[05:16:23] <Wafficus> lol twb
[05:16:25] <Wafficus> too funny :)
[05:16:54] <twb> oh you can also tell openssh to use a custom command for proxying
[05:17:22] <twb> ssh -oProxyCommand='gcloud fuck duck cluck suck -- nc real-backend-host 22'
[05:17:39] <Wafficus> lol
[05:17:39] <twb> ssh -oProxyCommand='gcloud fuck duck cluck suck -- nc %h %p' real-backend-host
[05:17:51] <twb> That's what people used to do before -J existed
[05:18:06] <Wafficus> gotcha, I'll put this in my work notes for my Emacs config goal notes
[05:18:09] <twb> As long as it can attach stdio to a port it'll work
[05:18:14] <Wafficus> how to implement it :/ eh, but we'll see
[05:18:37] <twb> Is "(client's environment name)-cli" the jump host or the backend server?

[05:33:53] <himesama> there is some jazz that is just sort of not musical.  i once heard some kind of bebop or something where there seemed to be a trend where right in the middle of some incoprehensible stuff they would throw in yankee doodle, perhaps as an admissison that even the musicians got lost.

[05:48:15] <himesama> there are boarding schools for elites in europe and usa

[06:07:57] <twb> In the UK, a college is a (mostly) autonomous teaching institution, and a university is a federation of same.

[06:08:14] <grym> twb: yeah, US college deans have no small amount of power
[06:08:16] <bpalmer> presumably you also had general education requirements.
[06:08:23] <himesama> the us has colleges too.  like bryn mawr, which is pretty distinct because vowels.

[06:08:52] <himesama> us college deans definitely have power
[06:08:52] <grym> not enough time
[06:09:17] <grym> 4 years to cram biomedical engineering into your head is like, two years too little for a proper BS
[06:09:20] <grym> sadly
[06:11:02] <bpalmer> The worst program I knew of in my school was the chemical engineering program, which had something like 120-130 credits of required classes (most of which were only offered once a year, so you were in lockstep), out of a total of 180 credits needed for graduation.
[06:11:23] <grym> chemE is not for the faint of heart 
[06:11:24] <bpalmer> It was routine for chemical engineers to take summer classes at least one year of their four just to try to fit everything in.
[06:11:56] <grym> ... and too often you go to waste in the oil and gas industry when you're done stabbing yourself in the eye with pchem, too

[06:13:41] <bpalmer> although now I'm having trouble recalling what the general education requirements were. Some amount of writing, some amount of history or world culture, some basic science, some basic foreign language skills
[06:14:05] <grym> the lock-step thing can get very interesting.  There's a 5-year masters program for sports physio/rehab here, with a practical exam at the end of your 4th year.  If you fail, you are effectively demoted to first year status because of the cascade of mandatory retakes that failure triggers

[06:14:47] <grym> (upshot: if you are given the choice of physiotherapists, pick one who came out of BU!)
[06:14:48] <himesama> world history would make sense but is there a world culture
[06:15:16] <twb> himesama: would it?
[06:15:17] <grym> himesama: "man, sunsets are pretty nice, huh?"
[06:15:34] <bpalmer> himesama: that's my phrasing, but some amount of history and literature across different regions
[06:15:55] <himesama> are they all just teaching postmodernism and its allies now?
[06:15:57] <bpalmer> himesama: so , maybe get some Chinese literature studies and some African diaspora film studies for credit towards "world culture"
[06:15:58] <twb> bpalmer: so e.g. Farsi poetry would count?

[06:19:23] <twb> Well I should say epistemology
[06:19:24] <himesama> logical positivism is a pretty narrow and historically bound school of thought
[06:19:29] <grym> and, uh, your experimental designs will benefit from drinking from it 
[06:19:35] <grym> himesama: it's also pretty wrong :)
[06:20:44] <himesama> well just  a little basic epistemology and metaphysics so that students do not make category errors (in the broad sense) would be welcome

[06:21:28] <cjb> aidalgol: so running a 'git gc' speed up vc-print-log by a lot, no idea why. my original assumption that loading .git/objects into ram speeds up vc-print-log seems to be wrong.

[08:52:38] <tali713> aidalgol: that's an example, post modern art is another example, the modern art movement is another example.
[08:52:46] <bpalmer> DuChamp is amusing because a number of his works look like they're simply random collections of objects, but on examination turn out to have been custom made.

[16:14:12] <bpalmer> as for the quote, it's from the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, at a point where the White Witch is briefly lecturing Aslan. His rejoinder is "Do not cite the deep magic to me, witch, for I was there when it was written."

[18:07:50] <bpalmer> xrogaan: you can rename in dired and it should affect any buffers visiting that file.
[18:08:16] <bpalmer> xrogaan: C-x d RET , and then R to rename the file when you've gone to it in dired.
[18:08:59] <xrogaan> ah, return.

[18:09:01] <xrogaan> ok
[18:09:18] <bpalmer> you can M-x rename-file RET but it won't (as I recall) affect your current open buffers ;you can also just write to a new location with C-x w but it doesn't remove the previous version of the file.
[18:09:37] <xrogaan> would rename work to move a file to another directory?
[18:10:00] <siraben> renaming with dired does that?
[18:10:02] <xrogaan> yeah, rename-file is an annoyance as my changes won't translate to the new place.
[18:10:23] <bpalmer> i'm pretty sure dired's R is just "run mv and then also handle buffers", so it should work
[18:10:36] <siraben> Hm, renaming with dired doesn't seem to affect open buffers

[18:11:01] <bpalmer> hm. That's a shame; I had memories. But I don't do it often and didn't test.

[19:49:03] <wasamasa> the typical pattern is to use push repeatedly and nreverse

[19:49:58] <siraben> oh, nconc doesn't set the variable in question

[19:50:46] <bpalmer> nconc works on values, not variables. (And I should say, working with variables, prepending is actually awkward as well)

[20:52:19] <acdw> vimsux: rpav is right with #'. in elisp lambda is a macro that expands into (function (lambda ...)) (or something)
[20:52:20] <vimsux> rpav i know i can remove # symbol but it's silly because with dash you can omit the whole lambda thing. i guess they use a macro of something to make it simpler
[20:52:41] <rpav> vimsux: i'm not sure what dash does, but what would you prefer it look like
[20:52:43] <acdw> siraben: i think.... so-long-mode ???
[20:52:43] <fsbot> Cannot predict now
[20:54:09] <vimsux> rpav with dash it is just: (--first (find-font (font-spec :name x)) mono-fonts)
[20:54:19] <rpav> if you're going for like eql or identity, i think there are easier ways to find, but that's a more complex lookup so the real cost isn't exactly in the `(lambda (x) ...`
[20:54:47] <rpav> that .. doesn't seem like much of an improvement to me
[20:55:15] <vimsux> yea it does the same thing, just shorter. is that kind of macro "abuse" wrong?
[20:55:36] <rpav> it's slightly shorter at the cost of some dubious syntax/etc
[20:55:55] <rpav> where is find-font coming from and/or why is it not completing for me
