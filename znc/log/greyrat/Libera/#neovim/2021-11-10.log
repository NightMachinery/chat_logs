[04:09:38] <mjlbach[m]> seems like a package bug
[04:10:36] <mrassiliMarouane> I don't find any documentation regarding sumneko lua installation using homebrew unfortunately, the issue I see is that I don't set the correct path or `cmd` 
[04:11:40] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, I'm saying that that tap has issues, I would just build sumneko from source
[04:12:32] <mrassiliMarouane> ahh okay I used brew because I find it easier than building from source, but I'll try that
[04:13:13] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, sumneko has made it easier to package recently but it's still getting on distribution repositories

[05:03:50] <nmuntz87[m]> so im trying to configure my LSP keybindings and my hover function  is set to  `buf_set_keymap('n', 'K', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>', opts)` is resulting in the following error: `man.vim: no manual entry for widgets` 
[05:03:50] <nmuntz87[m]> LspInfo says the client is attached
[05:04:43] <elianiva[m]> buf_set_keymap requires a bufnr as its first parameter
[05:05:17] <elianiva[m]> it should be `buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', ...)` where bufnr is the buffer with lsp attached
[05:05:25] <nmuntz87[m]> yes, this is in the on_attach function like on the example at khttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/

[05:36:22] <jaawerth[m]> the fact that it's man.vim complaining suggests to me that something else is interfering, though, unless you actually hit K from a manpage window and not the actual buffer? or the filetype is `man`?
[05:38:04] <jaawerth> or.. actualy it s ounds like it's just silently not mapping in that case, if keywordprg is set to `man`
[05:38:49] <jaawerth> you sure your `on_attach` handler has actually been invoked? I would expect at least an error if it failed to set the keymap rather than just silently not doing it

[18:28:37] <clason[m]> Bugs are actively fixed
[18:29:02] <clason[m]> But note that this is not a blanket "Neovim can't handle multibyte emojis" problem
[18:29:18] <clason[m]> The core handles them just fine (after all, much of it is shared with Vim).
[18:30:15] <clason[m]> It's only specific components that have issues, mostly those dealing with the "impedance mismatch" between different encodings or representations (Lua vs. internal, Lua UTF-8 vs. LSP UTF-16 etc.)
[18:30:31] <clason[m]> And each of these have to be tackled on their own terms

[18:37:32] *** Quits: zro (~zro@user/zro) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:38:16] <tomsen[m]> thats true. but it also maybe a better start just to create some lua file in your .config/nvim/lua directory and write your first logic there, then afterwards make a plugin out of it. of course after you found a cool name for the plugin
[18:38:47] <smolck> yeah that could work, obviously want to be comfortable with Lua scripts first ;)
[18:39:00] <tomsen[m]> here is a repo you could fork, and directly install as a plugin/make changes to it, https://github.com/jacobsimpson/nvim-example-lua-plugin
[18:39:04] <smolck> personally I would say a great way of learning is to look at other (relatively simple/straightforward) plugins, e.g. https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim, and see how they structure things
[18:39:41] <smolck> like how in that case you have `lua/rust-tools.lua`, and `lua/rust-tools/*.lua` which contains helpers/other stuff used by the main portion
[18:40:19] <dundargoc> !h write-plugin

[18:40:21] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`write-plugin`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_41.html#write-plugin) in *usr_41.txt*
[18:40:46] <dundargoc> Not sure how applicable/modern it is, but couldn't hurt to take a quick look.
[18:41:04] <dundargoc> Actually, I should've researched on it before blindly linking to it.
[18:41:16] <smolck> dundargoc: I think that's for vimscript (go figure) . . . maybe there should be a Lua version of this somewhere though
[18:41:55] <dundargoc> smolck: You are correct. Unfortunately I can't delete bot comments :)
[18:42:29] <smolck> smolck: and then in `lua/rust-tools.lua` a module is `return`ed which contains the functions it wants to export, and that is then (after the plugin is installed) used via `require('rust-tools').<some_function_from_the_module>()` or whatever
[18:42:53] <smolck> and then you have the other directories which can be used to define commands/autocmds/whatever in vimscript (although you can also do this in Lua if you really wanted, I think)
[18:43:29] <smolck> dundargoc: I can, but I think it's still at least somewhat applicable, so I won't ;)
[18:44:28] <smolck> * I think, via `vim.cmd` or otherwise, although there's no real reason to do *everything* in Lua unless you just want to)
[18:45:50] <p00f[m]> <smolck> "> <@nvim-help-bot:matrix.org..." <- how are you finding this out now? have you never done `q:` instead of `:q` by mistake?
[18:46:07] <tomsen[m]> there should be some kind of "learn nvim the hard way" book at some point. there is a lot of internal knowledge you need, to do and understand a lot of stuff.
[18:46:48] <smolck> p00f[m]: I have done that I think but you're assuming afterwards I stopped to think: "what just happened, and how did I make it happen, and where am I now?" ;)
[18:46:56] <p00f[m]> yeah
[18:47:32] <nullrequestshehe> smolck: I kinda want to try and use lua over vimscript where possible since I do need to run commands on the cli and parse output
[18:48:13] <smolck> okay so that would probably be done in a `lua/your-plugin.lua` or `lua/your-plugin/some_thing.lua` file
[18:48:28] <smolck> since I assume that'd be internal to your plugin

When leaving insert mode, it seems my rebinds take a second to take effect... For example, when I leave insert and press 'n' (my 'j' equivilent key), if I do so too quickly, i jump to the next search occurance of my most recent search
