[11:50:59] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: While FLOSS and FOSS are the same thing, they are neutral terms. It's best to just say libre software and then free software following.
[11:52:49] <DiffieHellman> A *lot* of proprietary services and software claim to be "open source", despite not meeting even the OSI's definition. "open source" can be taken to mean that the source is open and that's it.
[11:54:15] * M6piz7wk[m] uses technoliberal software
[11:54:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> as i oppose centralization :p
[11:54:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: disagree it just confuses the other party.. and Free in general is understood as Gratis..
[11:55:03] <White_Flame> how does "liberal" imply "decentralized"?
[11:55:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> technoliberal (political term)
[11:55:20] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[11:55:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> means Free Software + Decentralized 
[11:55:53] <White_Flame> ok, weird etymology then
[11:56:08] <DiffieHellman> That's why you call it libre software first, drive the point home that it means free and in freedom and not gratis and then move to call it free software (helpfully noting that proprietary software that is gratis is already named freeware).
[11:56:08] <White_Flame> if people invent terms, it'd be nice if they have a visible derivation :-P
[11:56:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> basically term made by a politilogists to represent the values that FSF established

[11:59:22] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: Things being supposedly open source but having non-free dependencies really bothers me lol, looking at you a couple rendering engines for 3d art <.<
[12:00:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: it's defined in political field not computer science so the terminology is different

[12:02:29] <DiffieHellman> It's really bothersome for hardware as well. There are libre 802.11ac and GPU drivers, but libre firmware just doesn't exist and sometimes isn't even possible thanks to signatures on firmware.
[12:03:09] <kittyblam> M6piz7wk[m]: Well, my issue is technoliberal implies liberalism, a lot of people in free software fields aren't of that description for better or for worse.
[12:03:16] *** Joins: leon (~znc@user/leon)
[12:03:39] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: Yeah there really needs to be a massive push on the free hardware/firmware/etc. front lol
[12:04:28] <DiffieHellman> It's very hard when we got characters like Broadcom.
[12:04:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: I would like OSHW/FSF more activistic in that area too.. Like EFF built a brute-forcing machine using a custom chips to prove a weakness in DSA compared to FSF that open endorses proprietary manufacturers.
[12:04:45] <White_Flame> not sure if the FCC would allow actual free firmware for radio stuff
[12:04:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> truly disgusting if you ask me -w-
[12:05:04] <DiffieHellman> There really isn't free or open source hardware, but there are libre hardware designs.
[12:05:42] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: Yes, the FCC tried to pass something that would more or less deny OpenWRT on routers.
[12:05:47] <kittyblam> I want to see unthinkable amounts of funds going into home fabs or otherwise hyperlocal fabs in makerspaces as opposed to large centralized ones for evereything
[12:06:22] <kittyblam> I don't know to what degree that is insane, but do know it would take a currently unthinkable effort for something more people aren't even aware of lol
[12:06:30] <White_Flame> need decentralized chip manufacturing.  I know there's been a few people playing with homemade fab componentry
[12:06:41] <kittyblam> ye
[12:07:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: disagree free and open-source hardware is what gave us 3D printers
[12:07:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> i hugging hate how ignorant everyone in FLOSS is to that -w-
[12:07:28] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: The FCC wouldn't care if you wrote libre firmware for a wireless card as long as it doesn't cause interference, but it is correct that you'll need to get a FCC license for the new firmware if you wanted to include that in a product.
[12:07:36] <White_Flame> M6piz7wk[m]: libre/pen hardware _plans_ you mean
[12:07:38] <White_Flame> *open
[12:07:52] <kittyblam> Yknow, on this topic
[12:08:00] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Free hardware designs gave up 3D printers, the actual hardware can't be "open source" by definition.
[12:08:06] <DiffieHellman> *us 3D
[12:08:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> White_Flame: Free/libre OpenSCAD files
[12:08:20] <White_Flame> sure
[12:08:35] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: With open enough design and quick enough personal manufacturing I think that would make sense as a term
[12:08:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: the actual hardware are dumb stepper motors and your favorite single board computer!
[12:08:47] <kittyblam> like, if everyone had a startrek replicator in their garage why not call it open source?
[12:09:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> startrek replicator is overengineering you just need to be able to make PCBs and plastics 
[12:09:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. https://www.relativty.com/
[12:09:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> just buy the material and press a button!
[12:09:39] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: Yes, but everyone doesn't have a startrek replicator.
[12:09:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... and then put it together
[12:10:41] <DiffieHellman> If something similar is created, people are going to screech about unauthorized food copying.
[12:10:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> also bioplastics are a thing so everyone can have their own startrek replicator at home
[12:10:48] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: so?
[12:10:58] <kittyblam> I was using it as an example
[12:10:59] <DiffieHellman> Yes, I'll be great.
[12:11:11] <kittyblam> If the exact hardware design
[12:11:19] <DiffieHellman> The example doesn't match the current state at all, so I pointed that out.
[12:11:23] <kittyblam> can be produced from dumb materials by an individual or small group
[12:11:31] <kittyblam> it should be considered free and open source hardware imo
[12:11:45] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: **YOU CAN LITERALLY GROW THAT AT HOME LIKE A HUGGING PLANT**
[12:11:59] <kittyblam> so like, something you can 3d print or something where there is a tutorial for wood carving a statue I argue
[12:12:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> and then grind that and pipe in the printer
[12:12:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> -w-
[12:12:06] <kittyblam> M6piz7wk[m]: what are you talking about?
[12:12:12] <DiffieHellman> Sadly home fabs aren't really suited to mass scale production, they only tend to be large enough to produce one IC at a time.
[12:12:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> bioplastics
[12:12:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> grow that like a plant at home and then print with it
[12:12:28] <White_Flame> why would you need mass scale?
[12:12:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's edible too so it can print you food 
[12:12:30] <DiffieHellman> Quality control is an issue, as each chip is made by hand as well.
[12:12:33] <White_Flame> you 're not serving a mass audience
[12:12:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> startrek-style cubes very nutritious
[12:12:54] <DiffieHellman> If you want 100 chips, doing it one by one gets old fast.
[12:13:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: you can just make a form for a chips to make them reproducible
[12:13:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> and with the 3D printers that reprap has you can probably print chips with it

[12:14:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: who in the right might would want 100 chips for this? just design the chip to do the work you expect it to..
[12:14:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> but like you can scale it
[12:14:17] <DiffieHellman> A holdout is probably to write Verilog and then to run that on a FGPA with libre programming software. If/once home fabs improve, you can just port that Verilog to a circuit layout.
[12:14:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> point being Libre and open-source hardware is a thing and FSF is shitting on it for 4 years now with that hugging "respect your freedom" garbage
[12:15:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> and even endorsing librem 5 that is proprietary af
[12:15:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> "just because it's allegedly made in KiCAD"
[12:15:45] <White_Flame> only in a vernacular sense
[12:15:49] <DiffieHellman> The FSF recommends hardware that appears to be free of malicious hardware.
[12:16:28] <DiffieHellman> Aside from the longest of graybears, truly free hardware is out of reach, so the FSF aims just a bit lower.
[12:16:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: yes that is shitting on libre and open-source hardware that makes me want to make all of my code into ethical software to make you all suffer
[12:17:24] <DiffieHellman> If you license your code under the nonfree "ethical source" license, I'll simply discard it as it obviously isn't any good.
[12:17:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: it's not.. you just need the ECAD files and can make it yourself
[12:18:38] <kittyblam> There really quite needs to be more of a focus on this type of thing tbh,
[12:18:41] <DiffieHellman> The librem 5 hardware seems to be compartmentalized to me. It does have a nonfree mobile chipset (as none that aren't exist), but such is connected via usb and you can fully disable it if you wish.
[12:19:13] <kittyblam> I think some guy got like 1k(?) transistors on a home fab recentlyish
[12:19:45] <DiffieHellman> The librem 5 is probably the best you can get if you want a mobile phone, so it's not wrong for the FSF to recommend that to people who would otherwise just get a typical Android mobile.
[12:20:26] <DiffieHellman> The FSF does also state; Please note that the secondary processor (or "baseband") on the device still contains nonfree software. To preserve your freedom and privacy, be sure to flip the killswitch after placing a call or sending a text.
[12:20:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: none gave me ECAD files when i asked for them -> proprietary, hug em

[12:21:24] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary hardware is an issue, but that's less important and much less solvable than proprietary software/
[12:21:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> How does that work for your "free software" that runs on that?
[12:21:29] <kittyblam> pine64 is so close to being an amazing company if they actually cared in the slightest about their customers tbh
[12:21:57] <kittyblam> their laptops don't even have basic things like replaceable wifi cards, its just a proprietary non-replaceable one
[12:21:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's very solvable from FSF's side by not endorsing librem 5 and thrashing "respect your freedom"
[12:22:45] <DiffieHellman> I would say in this specific situation, the recommendation is more helpful than harmful. 
[12:23:05] <kittyblam> btw going into the technoliberal term again
[12:23:26] <kittyblam> that is a dumb ass term, that I hope dies in whatever political case its being used in
[12:23:35] <DiffieHellman> A gift to someone that replaces their very proprietary tracking device, with one that tracks less is useful as considering that most people won't stop using mobiles.
[12:24:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: n terrible company that pretends to be libre while selling mostly copies or random chinese brands... the pinepen and rock64 are cool if i got ECAD files for them

[12:25:50] <DiffieHellman> Oh wait, they quote "intellectual property" on their site. Here I go attacking again. 
[12:26:09] <M6piz7wk[m]> everything can be described in a political terminology and technoliberal is the definition of values in Free Software by FSF
[12:26:21] <kittyblam> M6piz7wk[m]: It literally is much more precise than that, something a large number of people here *aren't*
[12:26:44] <kittyblam> people in the FSF or people supporting that type of thing support free software
[12:26:49] <kittyblam> not fucking technoliberalism

[12:28:07] <kittyblam> there would be some who would describe themselves as that, or maybe even agree with technoliberalism, but the politics in these groups are heavily varied
[12:28:14] <kittyblam> with the only non-variance being the factor of free software
[12:28:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. the MIT licenses that people are using are technosocialism as they allow to use the software and make it non-free.. 
[12:28:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: politologist don't have a political affiliation 
[12:28:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> they just let the science talk
[12:29:03] <kittyblam> I have never heard that term in my life,
[12:29:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> most likely because you are not politically active in that area
[12:29:33] <kittyblam> No, I am referring to
[12:29:55] *** Joins: thum (~thum@user/thum)
[12:30:03] <kittyblam> technosocialism, which is something that doesn't seem to exist as a term currently
[12:30:41] <DiffieHellman> That's just "open source".
[12:30:49] <kittyblam> and I haven't heard of any such group preferring MIT so it could be made non-free, those people are usually either corporate groups or people unfamiliar with free software and just know of open source software, who only like software to be open for
[12:30:55] <kittyblam> it literally is just as DiffieHellman said, open source
[12:30:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's not a term used it's just recognized to be compatible in many aspects the only difference being argument for making the software proprietary after it was FLOSS
[12:31:03] <kittyblam> No, not at all
[12:31:50] <kittyblam> socialism would actually imply there not being intellectual property, not "Those socialists use MIT to it so people can use proprietary software!"
[12:32:15] <kittyblam> there is one term in any use for that
[12:32:21] <kittyblam> open source, OSI
[12:32:53] <kittyblam> corporate, personal, literally the opposite of what that word would mean if it even exists
[12:32:55] <kittyblam> existed*
[12:32:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> it would imply that those who use MIT are technoliberal and we who force the use of GPLv3 compatible license are technosocial, but Free software is more liberal to be considered socialist

[12:33:43] <kittyblam> I believe you said a moment ago that
[12:34:07] <kittyblam> > eg the MIT licenses that people are using are technosocialism as they allow to use the software and make it non-free..
[12:34:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> i would rather argue it being about a culture e.g. in EU/US we have to enforce GPLv3 compatible so that people don't turn it into a proprietary and sacrifice on the values.. but e.g. in china/russia they prefer MIT as they will prefer to open-source it and make it available to everyone
[12:34:42] <kittyblam> I am quite confused because now you sound like you are saying that is not the case?
[12:35:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> i am saying that it would imply that, but it's not the case even though the argument is valid
[12:35:44] <kittyblam> it does not imply that in the slightest
[12:35:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> as that's the only argument that i am aware of to consider Free software socialist, but there are too many arguments for it to be liberal
[12:36:07] <kittyblam> because its not political itself
[12:36:07] <kittyblam> its just
[12:36:09] <kittyblam> free software
[12:36:25] <kittyblam> the only group I am aware of that is overtly political would be Social Domain licenses
[12:36:40] <kittyblam> but those aren't very popular in the slightest
[12:36:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: it does as socialism being everyone owns everyone and everyone has to have access to it which to me sounds more like our enforcing of GPLv3 compared to liberal that says you are free to do whatever you want with the software which implies MIT
[12:37:12] <kittyblam> no
[12:37:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> yes
[12:37:55] <kittyblam> these are unrelated political ideologies that shouldn't be tied in with free software, free software is its own thing
[12:37:59] <kittyblam> that also
[12:38:00] <kittyblam> is just wrong
[12:38:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> free software is politically defined as technoliberalism 
[12:38:19] <kittyblam> on every step
[12:38:23] <kittyblam> no it is not
[12:38:42] <kittyblam> technoliberalism (which is a very unpopular term as far as I can tell) may support free software
[12:38:50] <kittyblam> but free software is not technoliberalism
[12:39:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is popular term, but people are abusing FOSS to make it sounds like FOSS == OSI 
[12:39:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> so not many people are using it
[12:39:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> since there aren't that many politically active people to push for it 
[12:39:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> as OSI and their lobbist pay more :p
[12:39:43] <DiffieHellman> Past message huh?
[12:39:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: yet you can't disprove that 
[12:40:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> just saying "it is it's own thing"
[12:40:19] <kittyblam> can't disprove what?
[12:40:29] <kittyblam> I honestly don't know what you are trying to say right now, sorry
[12:40:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> FLOSS not being technoliberal
[12:40:38] <kittyblam> its not lol
[12:40:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: i am saying Free Software == Technoliberalism in political terminology 
[12:41:09] <kittyblam> this term, which isn't really even used much to begin with, may be contained within free software, or open software, or whatever else
[12:41:21] <kittyblam> but it does not contain any of those things within itself

[12:44:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> kittyblam: i am aligned with the view of certification not defining an expert on the subject, but i am not aware of any valid argument against Free Software not being technoliberalism excluding the mentioned one about technosocialism
[12:45:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> M6piz7wk[m]: also to showcase what i meant by this
