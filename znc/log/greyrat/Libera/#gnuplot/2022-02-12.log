[13:52:48] <olspookishmagus> an example of plotted vectors in 3D space?
[14:23:31] <olspookishmagus> I have made some progress
[14:23:49] <olspookishmagus> but I only get ONE arrow plotted? or maybe it's the last arrow in my file.dat?
[14:24:12] <olspookishmagus> gnuplot> splot 'file.dat' using 1:2:3:(1):(1):(1) with vectors filled head lw 2
[14:24:38] <olspookishmagus> this is what I use and this is my file.dat contents:
[14:24:39] <olspookishmagus> 0 0 0 1 5 3
[14:24:39] <olspookishmagus> 0 0 0 3 5 5
[14:24:40] <olspookishmagus> 0 0 0 1 9 4
[15:02:12] <olspookishmagus> I've been able to do what I wanted with Octave
[15:02:24] <olspookishmagus> but I want to be able to do it with gnuplot too
[15:02:48] <olspookishmagus> I mean the axis are not even aligned in gnuplot ...
[15:08:04] <olspookishmagus> oh wait, that seems to be happening also in Octave as well

[19:02:07] <jaggz> oh, here's a persistent link to my gnuplot perl script, which lets you pipe until user chooses to exit, while allowing mouse interaction with the plot: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/0581b0e6/
