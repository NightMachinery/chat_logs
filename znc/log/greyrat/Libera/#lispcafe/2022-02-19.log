[00:51:46] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[00:54:32] <gilberth> In theory the whole display state of a CLIM application is defined by a tree-structured display list of the sheet hierarchy and within the sheets of the output history aka display list within them. The application modifies this hierarchy and with time that new state is reflected to your display.
[00:55:49] <gilberth> I now ponder. Suppose I would just have a stream of all modifications done. Like "make a new sheet here", "move that thing there", "add a line", "remove that". Couldn't that be my network display server protocol?
[00:56:30] <moon-child> snapshots > diffs
[00:56:45] <moon-child> and you need a strategy for when the rate of changes exceeds the network bandwidth
[00:57:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aren't the compromises between snapshots & diffs why most video formats use both?
[00:58:00] <gilberth> moon-child: yep. I am getting there, slowly. I could "compress" the changes. And I could also transfer them on demand. Suppose a huge pane of 100k lines suddenly appearing. No need to transfer all those lines at once. You could send those few lines that are visible first.
[00:58:56] <gilberth> I imagine that the protocol knows about scrolling. Scrolling could happen at the display server.
[00:59:21] <moon-child> Aurora_v_kosmose: complicated.  Snapshots are more semantically coherent; diffs can be an _optimization_ strategy
[00:59:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> moon-child: Ah I see.
[00:59:56] <gilberth> I am just not sure how to pull that off. The server pulling what he needs would be the HANDLE-REPAINT protocol. That is server: "I'd like to display this and that part and don't know how, send me the content".
[00:59:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gilberth: It might be worth buffering a few pages both ways though to prevent stutter.
[01:00:16] <gilberth> As moon-child said.
[01:02:25] <gilberth> Aurora_v_kosmose: Yes. Cocoa does that with pixmaps. It generates redraw events for currently not visible parts of your scrolled pane. So a little scrolling could be served instantly by blittering. It then schedules more redraw events to keep some "safety" region beyond the currently visible readily rendered.
[01:03:23] <gilberth> This is important for iOS were scrolling is kind of animated.

[01:04:06] <gilberth> But as moon-child said, snapshots and diffs, compressed by skipping redundant writes, and only sending them in part, are orthogonal.
[01:04:33] <vms14> hi gilberth :D
[01:04:50] <vms14> it's at night here
[01:05:36] <gilberth> Yes, perfect time to get up, drink coffee and ponder display servers.
[01:06:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gilberth: Ah got it.
[01:06:13] <gilberth> I need to take a break from hacking. I have the feeling I am getting somewhere for a possible new display server protocol.
[01:06:13] <vms14> I've stolen a forth implementation in C
[01:06:25] <vms14> now I want to put dirty stuff on top of that

[01:07:09] <vms14> I'm sure I can find more like this one, but it seems it's good enough
[01:07:40] <vms14> found a shit that only reads words and execute them (I can do that by myself)
[01:08:07] <gilberth> I am just not sure, if I keep CLIM's output records as my display list, or if I construct my own and regard handle-repaint as the protocol. In theory not ever sheet with CLIM even has an output history.
[01:08:08] <kakuhen> i want to get ecl running on my ps vita
[01:08:50] <vms14> btw gilberth you said like something like clim maintains a state as a list?
[01:09:10] <vms14> in a way you could (save-state) into a file?
[01:09:35] <vms14> a way would be have a history of commands and just save that
[01:09:43] <gilberth> Sorry, I don't get what you are refering to.

[01:10:11] <vms14> In theory the whole display state of a CLIM application is defined   
[01:10:11] <vms14>            by a tree-structured display list of the sheet hierarchy and within

[01:10:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hayley: lol nice
[01:10:15] <vms14>            reflected to your display.  
[01:10:55] <vms14> yes, i didn't learn to use emacs
[01:11:08] <gilberth> Yes. I was pondering if the stream of writes to my internal state could already be a display server protcol. Nothing too CLIM specific here.
[01:11:20] <kakuhen> hayley: Just keep a UPS hooked to your Mac and data is integritied or something ;)
[01:12:00] <vms14> but reading this, sounds like you can save snapshots of the current clim application state and recover from that later
[01:12:26] <vms14> don't know if it's a feature present yet, but sounds like a nice feature
[01:12:28] <kakuhen> anyway, the fsync "lying" thing is imo a case of ppl forgetting that man pages are a thing
[01:12:36] <kakuhen> apple's own man pages on fsync basically tells you the "lie" it makes
[01:12:37] <gilberth> If font metrics would match, you could.
[01:12:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hayley: Holy shit those magnitudes of difference

[01:13:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> kakuhen: It could be misleading depending on how stats are presented.
[01:14:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as not mentioning the difference in the stats.
[01:14:08] <vms14> gilberth: another "easy" way is to save a command history
[01:14:14] <vms14> but not a nice way

[01:14:42] <kakuhen> for some reason women.el never works on my machine :(
[01:14:44] <gilberth> vms14: But if you tweak that, you could in theory take a sheet and degraft it from one port (display) and later graft it to another display. Could be done.

[01:15:32] <kakuhen> i dont blame the utility... mac os has the most stupid spots for storing manpages

[01:16:03] <vms14> kakuhen: I'm poor so I have not those problems
[01:16:03] <gilberth> And that would be useful. Think screen^Wtmux for CLIM applications.
[01:16:12] <vms14> :D
[01:16:34] <kakuhen> ok even using cat as my pager makes the output duplicate several letters
[01:16:35] <kakuhen> what a strange bug
[01:16:42] <kakuhen> there's 3 things that are possibly going wrong 
[01:16:55] <kakuhen> and i just figured out what it is
[01:17:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> kakuhen: Have you tried man -l $filepath ?

OS X requires fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC) to flush to disk, and some versions of ext3 only flush to disk if the the inode changed (which would only happen at most once a second on writes to the same file, since the inode mtime has one second granularity), as an optimization."
[01:25:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> btrfs & zfs have saved me a lot of trouble with the shitty power where I am.
[01:25:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> To think filesystems with similar care for integrity were only available in expensive enterprise stuff before annoys me to no end.
[01:25:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As if I was the only one dealing with unreliable infrastructure...
[01:28:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Although journaling wasn't bad, it didn't go quite as far.

[02:05:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The only reason the assembly/machine-code statement applies is because you can also do in-line assembly in C. But implementing an assembler DSL in Lisp isn't a herculean task either.

[02:05:55] <hayley> <me> But, if the participants in such a meeting think that they are designing a language that is "close to the metal", like C, then they should have no problems whatsoever writing a compiler which is competitive with the best available. Right?

[03:05:31] <vms14> when I saw this file I imagine the guy saying something like "I have to make a parser? easy stuff..."
[03:07:20] <gilberth> Very early C shows its B heritage as types were completely optional.
[03:07:55] <gilberth> I have seen things like main(argc, argv) int argv[]; { ... }
[03:08:16] <pl> that's the old, pre-prototype declaration style
[03:08:22] <pl> not so much typing optional
[03:08:25] <moon-child> at some point I realised that, if you leave off the types, function declarations are exactly the same in c and shell
[03:08:29] <moon-child> f() { ... }
[03:08:31] <gilberth> argv is a pointer to pointers. So an 'int' will do fine for a pointer.
[03:08:31] <moon-child> exactly the same
[03:08:39] <pl> (though auto-typing iirc existed from scratch)

[03:09:41] <gilberth> pl: I was refering to saying int argv[] instead of char **argv. argv is declared as an array of ints here, not of pointers.
[03:10:01] <pl> ah
[03:10:33] <gilberth> And the compiler would happy compile: foo (x) { return x[0]; }
[03:11:54] <gilberth> The 'char' type is only needed to address an octet instead of a word aka int. That's the B heritage I am referring to. I really saw code like that as when bored I like to read very early UNIX code as it is available now.
[03:12:47] <gilberth> This works too: struct { int x, y; } foo (p) { return p->x; }
[03:12:57] <vms14> which remembers I wanted to allocate only one bit, but it's not possible
[03:13:05] <pl> vms14: depends on platform

[03:13:11] <vms14> even if you malloc(1) you'll get malloc(8)
[03:13:31] <pl> vms14: malloc(1) allocates sizeof(char)
[03:13:41] <pl> which is guaranteed to be >=8 bits
[03:13:56] <pl> and for all practical purposes =8
[03:13:57] <vms14> I wanted only one bit :/
[03:14:11] <pl> vms14: use Ada then, or assembly on one of the bit-addressable CPUs
[03:14:24] <vms14> haha, I'm trying to use forth
[03:14:37] <gilberth> You can't, with C. sizeof(char) is defined to be 1. And sizeof can't be fraction.
[03:14:47] <vms14> trying to learn it, but mostly just looking at the web about forth
[03:14:55] <vms14> and all the implementations it has
[03:15:19] <vms14> you have a forth implemented in almost every language 
[03:15:29] <vms14> or better said, several forths
[03:15:49] <vms14> and in almost all cpu/arch/platforms
[03:15:56] <vms14> even in the game boy xd
[03:18:04] <vms14> I have to learn the basics and try to make an html generator in order to reproduce the lisp macro usage
[03:19:33] <vms14> I see a lot of power in a language that seems to have the lisp macros power and it's so easy to implement than even I could make some dirty implementation and would be usable
[03:20:38] <vms14> you don't have to implement lambda let environments...
[03:21:28] <vms14> just the behavior of the forth compiler for stuff like immediate and postpone and stack operations
[03:23:14] <vms14> when tried making a lisp I was printing every environment I traverse when looking for a symbol and seemed so wrong to have to traverse all the trees for every symbol
[03:23:49] <vms14> gilberth: how do you speed up or improve symbol lookups?
[03:24:25] <vms14> or better said, can you escape having to traverse all the fucking environments until you find the symbol?
[03:24:55] <gilberth> s-exprs and macros are very nice. I use that for my B32 assembler too. The syntax is s-expressions and you define your macros using CL. And I also use that for my primitive programming language, which is like B but with s-expressions. Even given such a low-level stupid language having CL for your macro allows you be very productive. I always wanted to do that C, but never could decide how the s-exprs should look like.
[03:25:46] <gilberth> vms14: Are you talking about a Lisp interpreter?
[03:25:48] <vms14> gilberth: are you transpiling code from cl?
[03:25:51] <vms14> yes
[03:26:15] <vms14> a lisp interpreter with scope needs environments and needs to traverse them for every symbol
[03:26:20] <gilberth> No, I am not transpiling. I just have macros available, which are like usual Lisp macros.
[03:27:11] <vms14> it didn't seem wrong at first, but try to print while traversing those environments and it will get annoying
[03:27:20] <gilberth> vms14: When interpreting, I just use ASSOC for the lexical environment and SYMBOL-VALUE for the global. And when compiling, I know where on the stack the lexical variables reside.
[03:27:49] <gilberth> It isn't so bad, when you have lexical scope.
[03:28:44] <vms14> the more scope has a variable you are refering to, the more you have to traverse the environments
[03:29:03] <gilberth> For dynamic scope you could consider shallow binding, which however won't work with multiple threads. But then I really don't like dynamic scope for I like to have closures proper.
[03:29:35] <vms14> what is shallow binding? 
[03:29:40] <gilberth> vms14: Yes, of course. You can escape that by compiling.

[03:31:06] <gilberth> vms14: Shallow binding for variables works by not pushing a new binding onto the environment, but by always having the symbol value at it's symbol value slot. When a variable is bound you save the old value and restore it, when leaving the scope. I don't recommend doing that though.
[03:31:10] <vms14> a compiler thinks about the program, my shit just translated stuff
[03:32:09] <vms14> gilberth: so you have a global variable that changes value depending on the scope
[03:32:13] <gilberth> Well, a bc compiler could be easy when your VM is a stack machine. Just flip prefix to suffix. Turn (foo 1 2) into 1 2 foo
[03:32:31] <vms14> gilberth: the stack makes everything so fucking easy
[03:32:58] <vms14> in the sense that your only problem is push stuff into the stack and execute expressions
[03:33:07] <vms14> expressions will find their stuff on the stack
[03:33:25] <gilberth> When you face (let ((x 10)) ...) just push the 10 and when 'x' is read, the compiler knows the number of values between the current top of stack and the 'x'.
[03:33:38] <vms14> yes
[03:33:46] <vms14> and you have efficient scope
[03:34:04] <vms14> even more if you manage to get some part of the stack as registers
[03:34:36] <vms14> usually in forth the top of a stack is a register and they say it speeds by 10%
[03:35:59] <vms14> but in my case the stack simplifies stuff in a way that make a language can be affordable by me
[03:35:59] <gilberth> Or you do as Emacs does. And have BIND, UNBIND, and VAR operations. <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/tiny-bc/pico-bc.lisp> does that.
[03:36:17] <gilberth> vms14: TOS being a register is an implementation detail of the BC interpreter.
[03:36:57] <vms14> gilberth: but I only see they put only tos as a register, not ton or the rest of the stack
[03:37:12] <vms14> there is no gain compared with the complexity added?
[03:37:41] <vms14> I don't get why ton is not also a register when numeric functions take 2 args
[03:37:45] <gilberth> Here is a compiler, which knows where on the stack the lexicals could be found: <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/tiny-bc/alt-bc.lisp> You find a comment with the instruction set there.
[03:38:46] <gilberth> This is more complicated because of closures. As when you have (defun foo (x) (lambda () x)) the 'x' lexical cannot live on the stack anymore.
[03:39:38] <gilberth> You could also JIT that BC: <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/tiny-bc/fib-jitted.lisp>
[03:40:31] <vms14> :O
[03:42:52] <gilberth> Add some register allocation and you could have assembly.
[03:44:05] * hayley watches some of the FOSDEM talks she was rambling about long ago, now that they happened, and still expects to observe JMC with high rotational velocity, would she visit his grave.
[03:47:45] <vms14> gilberth: actually some forths let you add inline assembly, I suppose you just put the opcode of every instruction and it works?
[03:48:14] <vms14> as long as you say the cpu, execute this shit and it's the opcode he wanted
[03:49:05] <vms14> I mean, I just have to put opcodes in memory and then point the instruction pointer to that memory?
[03:49:19] <vms14> or there is something more?
[03:50:42] <vms14> because then you get an interactive assembler
[03:51:13] <gilberth> I never used Forth.
[03:51:41] <gilberth> Can Forth generate Forth? Like as PS could generate new PS code?
[03:56:56] <vms14> depends
[03:57:41] <vms14> usually forth is written in asm and it's just a collection of primitive words which are asm code and secondary words which are lists of memory adressess of primary and secondary words
[03:58:42] <vms14> the compile mode is just creating a secondary word, which is to put a new word in the dictionary memory and "unroll" the list of memory adresses in this word
[03:59:16] <vms14> but, words can be marked as immediate which means when compiling instead of put the memory adress of the word you execute the word at compile time
[03:59:53] <vms14> note that the word could do stuff in the stack, has the whole language accessible and can read the input buffer as reader macros do
[04:00:20] <vms14> also you have a return stack used by the language where you can put stuff
[04:00:39] <vms14> so you can have call with cc 
[04:01:26] <vms14> the whole idea is an interesting concept and the main reason I'm wondering if I should adopt forth as my main language instead of lisp
[04:01:53] <vms14> because it would mean to have my main language available everywhere as I'm able to implement it wherever I want
[04:01:59] <vms14> a thing I cannot do with lisp
[04:02:34] <gilberth> Well, with PS a procedure is just a vector^Warry marked executable. PS could craft those arrays at run-time.
[04:02:43] <vms14> also as I told you before, some forths can compile asm words
[04:03:00] <vms14> like the inline asm of c
[04:03:23] <gilberth> Which of course will not be portable.
[04:03:30] <vms14> I think they just have the opcodes of the machine and make a list of those opcodes?
[04:03:55] <vms14> gilberth: you can write this language in less than an hour
[04:04:06] <vms14> in asm I suppose it would take more
[04:04:27] <gilberth> With PS the nice thing is that I can write a Lisp -> PS compiler in PS itself.
[04:04:36] <vms14> but if it's not asm,, then you can't play with memory adresses
[04:04:52] <gilberth> No, and I don't want to.
[04:05:09] <vms14> no but in the case of forth it forces you to emulate them
[04:05:22] <vms14> as the return stack is used to return from words
[04:05:53] <gilberth> And? How is that related to actual physical memory? Why do I need to care about that?
[04:06:37] <vms14> because words are just a memory address
[04:07:31] <gilberth> Not pointers into just some array?
[04:08:02] <vms14> well actually they have a header and a body
[04:08:56] <vms14> the header has the name and additional info like if it's immediate and some flags
[04:09:16] <gilberth> Anyhow, when you care about a sane stack based language, I suggest you take a peek at PS as a language. It's quite nice.
[04:10:22] <gilberth> It has dynamic typing, code is data and it comes with a GC.
[04:11:38] <clothespin> hello
[04:11:55] <gilberth> Hello there, clothespin.
[04:12:02] <clothespin> that was hunt and peck typing
[04:12:27] <vms14> gilberth: it's likely you'll like forth if you like ps
[04:12:41] <vms14> clothespin: hi
[04:13:01] <vms14> lol didn't know ps had a gc
[04:13:25] <clothespin> i appreciate forth, but it's awfully terse in practice
[04:14:09] <gilberth> I am not sure, if would like Forth. Does it come with dynamic typing and a GC? Is code data?
[04:16:00] <vms14> gilberth: data is code
[04:16:20] <vms14> well words are code and can be data or code
[04:16:43] <vms14> it has metaprogramming ability if that's your concern
[04:16:45] <gilberth> So Forth can generate new Forth? Forth code could generate new Forth code and invoke it?
[04:16:59] <vms14> I think it can do all lisp macros can including reader macros
[04:17:12] <vms14> but I'm not sure and it's this what I really want to check
[04:17:40] <clothespin> giberth is waiting on fifth
[04:17:43] <vms14> forth code is words and forth can generate new words
[04:18:01] <vms14> also, it's likely the forth you'll use will be written by you
[04:18:09] <vms14> so if it misses something shame on you
[04:18:42] <clothespin> don't we have enough things to be ashamed of?
[04:18:54] <vms14> but I think you can enjoy writing a forth as I see you writing "funny" lisps
[04:19:06] <vms14> clothespin: never is enough
[04:19:52] <gilberth> Hey, the Lisp is not funny. The languages I use to implement the Lisps with are funny, like Rust or Perl. I am not brave enough to attempt to do in INTERCAL.
[04:20:01] <clothespin> i might go to a real cafe for breakfast
[04:20:01] <vms14> it is several times easier to implement
[04:20:24] <vms14> gilberth: they inherit the fun
[04:20:41] * gilberth points to JMC's paper. That's easy.
[04:21:22] <vms14> actually what will take you time is knowing what to implement
[04:21:35] <vms14> but once you do you could even make ps write forths
[04:21:43] <gilberth> If you're crazy you could have <http://clim.rocks/lisp100/lisp100.c> and <http://clim.rocks/lisp100/init.lisp> to be fully meta-circular. Have fun.

[06:11:50] <vms14> This is a self-hosted implementation of Forth, which can regenerate itself from Forth source code. The bootstrapping process uses a metacompiler written in Lisp to target a small inner interpreter and a handful of code words written in C.
[06:12:31] <vms14> A new metacompiler written in Forth generates an x86 executable using using assembly language code words.
[06:12:58] <vms14> so yes, forth can generate a new forth
[06:21:21] <gilberth> This is not what I meant. Not a Forth implementing Forth, but data being code at runtime. Like CL:COMPILE or even CL:EVAL.
[06:22:35] <gilberth> As (compile nil '(lambda () (+ x 1)) gives you a new function. As [ 1 /add cvx ] cvx does in PS.
[06:23:39] <gilberth> So my question was, has Forth a function that would turn some data into a new function? Specified.
[06:24:50] <gilberth> Not whether I could write a Forth interpreter in Forth. Or a compiler living in some other environment.
[06:25:31] <gilberth> Rather trageting some other environment.
[06:29:24] <vms14> I think yes, but cannot really arge why or how
[06:29:30] <vms14> argue*
[06:30:00] <gilberth> In PS [ and ] are used to construct an array. [ pushes a mark and ] gathers everything on the stack up to the mark and gives you an array. cvx makes sth executable. You could also say [ 1 2 add /add cvx ] cvx which turns into { 3 add }, which is procedure adding 3. When you invoke it the 1 2 add isn't evaluated, it's evaluated at the time you construct that array.
[06:30:53] <gilberth> vms14: If you can, the standard must have a primitive for that. That was my question. If it doesn't have a primitive, it doesn't count as it is not part of the language proper.

In conventional Lisps passing an expression to a Macro will always pause the evaluation, and so the arguments cannot be dynamic, only symbolic.'

[10:19:57] <hayley> Er, R¯¹RK
[10:22:43] <hayley> Reminds me of one thing: that scripting language for a Garry's Mod plugin that I despise could legitimately be called an "interpreted language" to an extent, I think. There is an "op" quota, and if you exceed it, your program is killed. You have to count ops, no matter if you constant fold, unroll, or do any tricks.
[10:22:51] <hayley> But, then again, it wouldn't be hard to fudge the op count. Just a passing thought.
[10:23:21] <moon-child> are you allowed 'data'?
[10:23:24] <moon-child> could build an interpreter
[10:25:04] <hayley> I can, but at the moment I am being bothered with optimising tight loop code written in that damn language. So I have to do loop invariant code motion myself.
[10:26:56] <hayley> Though it is not worth my brain CPU time, it's funny that you simply cannot manipulate so-called "S-expression" lists, and most expressions are going to be those. So much for "more homo-iconic" [sic].
[10:27:34] <hayley> I didn't know they could make a book that gives you brain damage until Mr Daniel Holden showed it was possible.

[11:58:44] <gilberth> moon-child: I see. To be fair there are also many flavors of Lisp. But I take that EVAL/COMPILE is not a common feature of Forth. I skimmed the ANS(I) draft, there is an EVALUATE primitive, but it's not clear to me, if it can return subroutines. It also is not clear to me whether subroutines are first class even. The list of data type doesn't mention them.
[11:59:34] <moon-child> ANSI is definitely not popular among forth programmers, I can tell you that much
[12:00:06] <moon-child> and: usually forth is bootstrapped from a small number of 'words' (not unlike lisp in that respect)
[12:00:23] <mfiano> When you see "C sin H", without any parens in a formula, should I assume to take the sine of H?
[12:00:51] <moon-child> that would be my interpretation
[12:00:57] <moon-child> C times the sine of H
[12:01:04] <mfiano> Ok just checking
[12:03:09] <gilberth> moon-child: So, it makes it harder for me to judge whether Forth can generate Forth code. In a structured fashion even that is not from a character string. However when that would be common feature, we wouldn't ponder about it that much.
[12:08:50] <hayley> Someone told someone else to type "quit" into the Source console, and that latter someone did it. I can't even

[12:10:26] <hayley> moon-child: You get free diamonds.
[12:10:44] <gilberth> hayley: Try +++ ATH then. Be sure to wait a little after you typed +++.
[12:11:20] <hayley> "Apparently, for some time a number of Hayes employees would post to the Usenet with strings like "+++ATH" in the text.[8] This would cause a TIES modem to hang up.[9]" lol
[12:12:09] <gilberth> There needs to be a pause between +++ and ATH, that's the in-band signaling for out-of-band data.
[12:12:25] <hayley> If you have a modem with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Independent_Escape_Sequence then not.
[12:13:23] <gilberth> Oh, that's awful. Heh, at least I made look up what ATH means.
[12:14:20] <gilberth> Here is another trick: ~.
[12:19:38] <moon-child> Recently, I actually wanted to type ~. at the beginning of a new line over an ssh connection, and completely forgot it was interpreted specially
[12:21:32] <gilberth> ssh does that too?

[12:43:50] <gilberth> I can imagine that.
[12:43:53] <dave0> "worst bushfire season ever" even though we have them since thousands of years
[12:45:13] <gilberth> There is another thing: News coverage is way more global these days. If there is some flood in a remote distant part of the world, I read in the news about it and TV -- which I don't watch -- broadcasts pictures. I believe it wasn't that way in the 80s, say.

[13:02:33] <gilberth> Because the thinkpad was not worth it or because the thinkpad was so robust?

[16:52:31] <shka> and to be fair, it is visually impressive
[16:52:56] <shka> but there is simply focus on stuff that i have less interest in 
[16:53:18] <shka> and execution is... not perfect
[16:53:28] <selwyn> visually impressive is boring nowadays
[16:53:47] <shka> insert obligatory cruelty squad reference 
[16:54:13] <selwyn> and not necessarily due to plateauing of visual improvements
[16:54:37] <selwyn> i played black mesa recently, and the xen levels were simply stunning
[16:54:43] <shka> anyway, if CP would have a narrower scope, and simply focus on the stories in the cyberpunk world, it would work way better then what it is right now
[16:55:04] <ck_> does it have good polish audio (did you try it?)
[16:55:13] <selwyn> not because of the rendering, or whatever, but because they were made by people who clearly had a passion for world building and detail, with a coherent artistic direction
[16:55:44] <shka> ck_: sure it has, and witcher 3 in Polish sounds WAY better 
[16:56:03] <shka> selwyn: again, insert cruelty squad reference 
[16:56:36] <shka> C O H E R E N T
[16:56:40] <shka> xD

[16:58:21] -ixelp- Witcher III - English vs Polish - YouTube
[16:58:29] <shka> english sounds so try-hard
[16:58:42] <shka> Polish is natural 
[17:00:34] <ck_> to you
[17:00:48] <selwyn> i've noticed this in some bilingual tv shows and films i've watched recently
[17:01:01] <selwyn> i don't think it is the fault of the (voice) actors
[17:01:18] <selwyn> so much as writing dialogue in two languages seems to be really, really hard
[17:01:43] <shka> ck_: no, i mean, gerald sounds like he is actually being himself,
[17:02:08] <ck_> to my ears, both sound similarly theatrical
[17:03:05] <shka> i also like yennefer voice more 
[17:03:09] <selwyn> metro 2033 didn't sound that weird when i started playing it in english
[17:03:39] <selwyn> but you have to play a game set in the apocalyptic moscow metro with english subs :)
[17:34:52] <selwyn> disco elysium will get adapted for tv
[17:56:40] <shka> huh, really?

[17:58:09] <shka> cool
[17:59:36] <selwyn> it might suck
[17:59:55] <shka> sure
[17:59:59] <shka> i may be also good
[18:02:21] <shka> or have a one good season :P

[19:18:04] <pl> Their Wot adaptation was great for 6/8ths,then totally fucked up finale 
[19:20:38] <selwyn> u wot m8
[19:20:54] <shka> wheel of time most likely
[19:21:19] <pl> Yep 
[19:21:31] <ck_> ifuckinfiteyourswearonmemum
[19:25:15] <pl> Well, they fucked over the plot line, hard 
[19:25:52] <shka> "see hard fucking on the amazon prime!"
[19:26:53] <pl> I could excuse everything else (casting was actually great, even if it stretched things at times), I guess props could have been better, it's the butchery of finale that I have issues with 
[19:27:27] <selwyn> i suspect its down to the huge budgets they have available for productions
[19:27:50] <selwyn> they can afford to take questionable decisions if it means that only some things will end up really good
[19:28:06] <pl> shka: more like "do you want to feel fucked without any gentleness or lube?" 
[19:28:08] <selwyn> and people will watch shows that finish badly anyway, because they are already interested in them
[19:28:21] <pl> selwyn: arguably WoT was pretty low budget 
[19:28:52] <selwyn> ok, but how much money does amazon spend on all of their shows combined
[19:29:19] <pl> Yes, but that's not an excuse to botch individual shows 
[19:30:18] <selwyn> no
[19:32:05] <shka> first season of "the boys" was pretty good
[19:32:22] <shka> second was just a failure
[19:32:32] <shka> and nothing makes sense in that show anymore
[19:34:10] <selwyn> thats a shame
[19:34:16] <selwyn> i also heard it was good in the first season
[19:34:25] <shka> it was decent
[19:34:41] <shka> arguably started strong, and ended weak
[19:35:09] <shka> a shame because the whole concept was pretty interesting
