[00:03:56] <InPhase> buzzard: Yes, the order is not sequenced.
[00:03:59] <buzzard> i just tried it out and it works as i expect (performs the assignment using current value of x and then increments), but that might just be luck

[00:35:40] <ProfSimm> I'm thinking, what if having "input" and "output" is unnecessarily splitting the interface of a function in two. What if we just have a singular concept, the "form". You pass a form, which is a set of data, and leave some placeholders in. Then the function's role is to fill-in the missing pieces. It's like someone giving you a paper form, and saying "fill it". Or like a test at school. This would allow a function to see what type of output it has t
[00:35:58] <ProfSimm> This would allow a function to see what type of output it has to produce, so we could overload functions on output type without scattering type inference all over the code.

[00:37:12] <pyzozord> I'd say the traditional model is traditional because it reminds more of mathematical functions
[00:37:22] <[itchyjunk]> Man.
[00:37:29] <[itchyjunk]> The game I play's ranking system is wack.
[00:37:40] <[itchyjunk]> My game crashed and they gave em a HUGE quitting penalty.
[00:38:02] <pyzozord> But that idea of having one bucket of stuff you give a function and then take that bucket back and stuff in the Backer changed - I had a similar idea
[00:38:22] <pyzozord> But really it's kind of the same thing it's just more syntax
[00:39:04] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: sometimes it's more syntax. But sometimes it's less syntax. For example in GraphQL you have the issue of having to specify a type tree in the input, and then again for the output that this type tree follows. 
[00:39:29] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: this is when you gotta tell the function more specifically what output you want, like SQL's SELECT for example
[00:39:54] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: it's less duplication to specify the types and put placeholders for the value and say "yes, this right here, gimme it"

[00:48:55] <pyzozord> I'm not following, sorry
[00:51:07] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: well let's say we have a function that accepts four arguments: a b c d.  But you leave some of them as placeholders, and that's the function output, it has to solve the placeholder according to this expression: a * b + c = d
[00:51:39] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: So say you pass sumproduct(a: ?, b: 5, c: ?, d: 32) 
[00:52:25] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: it knows the result should be 32 and one of the operands of multiplication is 5. All args are integers, so it divides 32 by 5, and this produces 6 and leftover (modulo) 2
[00:52:45] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: this is integer division and modulo example.
[00:53:04] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: if you use different placeholder position you get multiplication, addition and so on

[00:53:59] <pyzozord> Not sure what point you are trying to make and how it relates to the idea you mentioned previously about functions receiving some space where they need to write results

[00:55:20] <biberao> im getting some errors Error while decoding stream #0:0: Invalid data found when processing input and Invalid NAL unit size (-1706217763 > 158)
[00:55:25] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: the idea is you don't differentiate input and output, you can choose on each call what is a placeholder, and what's a value. So you have one function which you can "flip around" you provide the result, it has to figure out the input

[03:02:32] <nomagno> I'm facing around 100 times difference memcpy'ing 4096 bytes inside the VM vs. on an optimized C test
[03:02:52] <flakland> those instructions would certainly be consuming more cycles
[03:03:23] <nomagno> so, like, my VM is around 100 times slower than an equivalent x86 native code
[03:03:38] <nomagno> (nanosecond-level measurements)
[03:03:43] <oldlaptop> is memcpy() really a good test case for that?
[03:04:02] <oldlaptop> particularly the crazily tuned-up asm version you're probably getting from your C library?
[03:04:26] <nomagno> let me turn off optimizations, I'm using -Ofast on the native test
[03:05:03] <pyzozord> Memcpy almost certainly uses vector instructions, it's not a fair contest
[03:05:07] <oldlaptop> unless you're testing your own implementation of memcpy(), I bet compiler optimizations aren't really even relevant, the tight part of it is probably asm on most systems
[03:05:18] <Decker> there's tricks you can do - like increment the array base and index with constants...  for( size ) dst[0]=src[0]; src++;dst++;  instead of for( i < size ) dst[i]=src[i];i++;  but I doubt that's your issue
[03:05:27] <FloridaMan> Damn, I missed my opportunity to ask, "African or European 6502 emulator?"
[03:05:28] <flakland> iirc the fastest implementaiton is 'rep movsb' 
[03:05:31] <oldlaptop> maybe even vectorized asm, especially on amd64 (which has vector instructions by definition)
[03:05:37] <Decker> rep movsq
[03:06:02] <Decker> fix up the stray bytes with movsb movsw mosd as required - it's only a few bit tests

[03:07:20] <pyzozord> Imo copy the memory yourself and turn off the optimizer

[03:37:43] <nomagno> Why? It's a perfectly respectable reading speed

[03:38:03] <nomagno> I think pyzozord's Dutch
[03:38:17] <pyzozord> I'm polish living in The Netherlands
[03:38:26] <oldlaptop> Dutch is arguably the closest living relative to English
[03:38:37] <nomagno> Oh well, yeah you definitely have it tougher than me
[03:39:29] <nomagno> We could compare native language reading speed, but that would also relate to information density, so it wouldn't be much more useful
[03:39:31] <pyzozord> My IO has lag and lost packets :(
[03:39:47] <oldlaptop> you really need to compare the same text
[03:40:11] <nomagno> Well we just did
[03:40:41] <oldlaptop> (and you can't very well do that for native-language-speed if you don't have the same native language)
[03:40:43] <pyzozord> I think that this dyslexia thing is really what causes it, either that I'm just not that sharp
[03:41:14] <oldlaptop> Maybe measure the time it takes to measure carefully-constructed parallel texts? (i.e. without regard to information density)
[03:41:27] <oldlaptop> or, rather, without regard to "words per minute"
[03:42:23] <pyzozord> I think the comparison was pretty fair. We are both european, both non native speakers, well familiar with the english language and read the same text
[03:43:01] <pyzozord> Whatever differences between Polish and Spanish I don't think can account for 50% drop in both speed and retention
[03:43:01] <nomagno> It might be slightly skewed by relative closeness of native languages
[03:43:27] <nomagno> Well, don't take the retention thing very seriously, it was four ABC questions.
[03:43:41] <nomagno> But the speed decrease is definitely just a difference in reading speed

[03:46:27] <pyzozord> To get retention of 75% I'd need to drop my reading speed to about 100wpm I suspect
[03:46:57] <pyzozord> Well between 30% and 300% slower
[03:47:15] <bjs> Or you could just not care what some silly website says, the comprehension score was pretty random for me given the fact it only asked 4 questions of such a small bit of text

[03:57:42] <pyzozord> It is in many cases. Well close enough anyway. Many guides, or even things like C standard
[03:57:57] <bjs> It's closer to legalease than novel
[03:58:12] <pyzozord> C standard is even harder because the words have very strict very defined meaning
[03:58:27] <bjs> pyzozord: nah the C standard is very much not like a novel, it's the kind of text you have to constant go back and re-read and it takes a very long time to make it past even a single sentence

[03:59:02] <pyzozord> Well it's like a novel in the sense that it's a wall of text, which is the problem for me

A dense standard is completely different,  reading something like the C standard you will build up mental "debt" as you read, each clause gets slower and slower and slower to understand and comprehend as more and more definitions and cross references enter your head until eventually you can't read any more

[04:08:00] <bjs> even something like the C standard is already getting far beyond reading it like a novel, and it's only mildly dense (you're not swimming in formalisations or anything)

[08:03:09] <InPhase> png will produce a better quality image, supports transparency, and supports animation.  But jpg will typically make for a smaller image.

[08:20:44] <InPhase> All the ones I have to try.
[08:21:04] <JanC> apparently nowadays they do
[08:21:18] <JanC> Blink didn't add support for it until 2017
[08:21:48] <JanC> and Webkit only in 2015
[08:23:28] <JanC> Mozilla tried to get everyone to adopt it since 2004 and they (Apple, Google, etc.) all refused for all sorts of commercial/political reasons
[08:23:49] <JanC> then suddenly 10-15 years later they suddenly do?

[08:28:25] <oldlaptop> it's quite possible for JPEG to be *bigger* than PNG for the kind of image that ought to be PNG anyway - while having poorer quality
[08:28:28] <InPhase> It sounds like the early opposition was mostly a conflict over the preferred file extension.  That sounds like a silly thing to set such a format back by a decade over.
[08:29:05] <oldlaptop> (I'm thinking of things like scans of books and documents, or the kinds of logos/graphics PNG and GIF before it were really made for)

[08:34:57] <oldlaptop> JanC: misinformation feeds into it too, particularly the general idea that dialup is dead, or slow ADSL is dead, or otherwise "everyone" has a big-city fast connection
[08:34:58] <[itchyjunk]> just clever in a bandwidth way
[08:35:46] <sonny> wasm is nice, and JS vms seem to have nice JITs
[08:36:25] <oldlaptop> or the (richly-merited) contempt for cheap-junk chromebooks and netbooks and the like, which sort of tends to bleed over into not realizing that the client may not be a very good computer
[08:36:51] <sonny> [itchyjunk] could not figure it out so I'm know searching the web for this solution, skipping problems is certainly a useful technique
[08:36:59] <oldlaptop> even in businesses like (in the US) K-12 education where the developers really ought to know better
[08:37:43] <sonny> yeah
[08:38:06] <sonny> but edu tech seems to have some of the worst stuff
[08:38:14] <JanC> back in the days we would run tests over a bandwidth-limiting proxy to see how fast it would be over a slow dial-up line & such  :)
[08:38:25] <EdFletcher> we still do that 
[08:38:50] <JanC> (back when I did web development, long ago)
[08:38:51] <oldlaptop> https://danluu.com/web-bloat/ remains vitally important reading for anyone doing or contemplating web development
[08:39:28] <EdFletcher> and https://web.dev/measure/ an important tool for measuring your site(s) 
[08:42:33] <InPhase> EdFletcher: Google.com gets a score of 85/100 on there forr SEO.
[08:43:17] <EdFletcher> InPhase: LMAO! that's beautiful 
[08:43:25] <InPhase> EdFletcher: It scores google.com as taking 6 seconds to become interactive.  Seems a little sketchy.  :)
[08:44:31] <EdFletcher> InPhase: haha odd indeed but i'd bet they've added logic to prevent people from getting real measures on their own sites 🙂 either way i've used it for a long time to valuable effect, have never had reason to distrust the results when pointed at non-google domains 🙂 
[08:44:54] <InPhase> I tried to evaluate my personal site, but it returns only "(!) Error".  But, my site does work...
[08:45:04] <EdFletcher> LOL 
[08:45:18] <sonny> what's to measure? browsers can tell you page load time
[08:45:49] <oldlaptop> sonny: You might want to automate that process, or test it through a connection other than your own, or...
[08:45:57] <sonny> ohhh
[08:46:06] <JanC> that's also trivial to do with modern browsers
[08:46:09] <KillerWasp> sonny: the measure is with the google api. lol
[08:46:14] <oldlaptop> (not sure a Web-based service fills most of those needs particularly well)
[08:46:53] <oldlaptop> any form of measurement, however, assuming it has at least some connection to reality, is probably better than none
[08:47:01] <EdFletcher> sonny: it's really just a useful, nice UX around https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/, which as oldlaptop notes many use in an automated pipeline to keep track of these metrics across changes 
[08:47:02] <KillerWasp> google can control the ranking of the webs.
[08:48:13] <oldlaptop> InPhase: Maybe it doesn't work for one or more of the IPs that service is using.
[08:52:51] <KillerWasp> s/google api/google SEO/
[08:53:41] <KillerWasp> I wonder if it's well seen that google is also running in the ranking to brag that it is widely used.

[11:16:31] <Decker> I also made these bingo balls that rotate around in a random direction and when flipped backward changes the background; making them sort of infinite sided balls... but to make it easy I made each ball and each slot reel a separate canvas, so you could style/postion/animate them individually

[15:35:13] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Using half the chip is fine for RAM, but for an EEPROM you have to worry about positioning and such. Like, if I want to wire only 16kB of the EEPROM, I'd have to have a 16K blob of zeros at the beginning.

[15:37:08] <vdamewood> Oh, that. Sure, but then I'd still have to write the code to the upper half of the EEPROM.
[15:38:38] <vdamewood> Wait, would I? I could wire it so the lower half is mapped to the upper 16k range.
[15:39:00] <vdamewood> I woud just ground the high-order address pin.
[15:39:14] <vdamewood> s/high/highest/
[15:39:27] <GeDaMo> Wouldn't you have to pull the high address high?
[15:39:39] <Decker> if you use some of that memory mapped IO to a small MMU you could even page multpile 16 k chunks there instead
[15:42:08] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: The way I have it working in my head is that I'd use logic gates to turn the enable pin on when the highest order bits of the address bus are in the right range for the EEPROM, then the lower order bits are mapped to the EEPROM's address pins. If I'm using the lower 16k of a 32k chip, I would need to discard the highest-order address pin on the EEPROM.

[15:45:49] <mrig> ProfSimm an interesting facet of space to ponder might be that you can never not move in it; To be stationary is quite impossible.

[15:54:38] <nomagno> mrig: Well yes, but that essentially states the opposite: the external perception of time passing for you slows down as you approach the speed of light
[15:55:10] <mrig> That is the same thing as mass only having gravity when it is moving.
[15:55:43] <mrig> if you stop moving you have infinite mass, so that was a bit backwards.
[15:55:52] <mrig> but you catch my drift.
[15:56:26] <nomagno> Not really, gravity is a different beast in this context, it makes spacetime noneuclidean
[15:56:38] <mrig> but motion is completely tied into E=mc^2

[16:05:04] <vdamewood> nomagno: Yep. There's a trick to figuring out how much space an address can handle that I figured out. the last digit is the log2 of the quantity, and the 10's digit is the log2 of the unit. SO, 2^10 = 1024, so 16 is 2^6 k is 64k.

[16:06:00] <vdamewood> so, 24 bits is 2^4 (=16) mega(2) bytes.

[17:48:28] <nomagno> Sane architectures have fixed length instructions whose number of operands is variable, but fixed for each instruction
[17:48:54] <dan01[m]> vdamewood: What I don't understand is that if you have a memory address that's 64 bit, then a CPU word is usually also 64 bit, so then there's no place to take an opcode like Load and the actual memory address in one word, since only the memory address alone takes up all the space, right?

[17:49:29] <nomagno> dan01: Well yes, the operands are a different story
[17:49:44] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: Right, you do one of two things. Load a few bits in one instruction, shift, then load some more. Or two, you have multiple load instructions for different orders of bits.
[17:49:44] <nomagno> But they usually follow a documented pattern
[17:50:26] <vdamewood> For example, you might be able to load a 12-bit immediate value. If you want a 24-bit address, you load the high-order 12 bits, shift 12 bits, then load the low-order 24-bits.

[18:55:58] <vdamewood> rsonx: Back to you, no tutorials. I just learned how to make grammars and noticed how precedence resulted from it.
[18:57:31] <vdamewood> rsonx: It's kind of simple, if you want precedence in your grammar, you make a rule for one operator, and a rule for the other operator, and the one with higher precedence is an operand to the rule for the lower-precedence one.
[18:57:31] <rsonx> understandable
[18:58:52] <pyzozord> oh he left
[18:59:03] <vdamewood> So, for example, if you say the result of a multiplication or division is a TERM, and the result of an addition or subtraction is an EXPR, then you can say EXPR ::= TERM '+' TERM | TERM '/' TERM, and TERM will have higher precedence.

[20:37:47] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: ordered arguments are terrible for extensibility. Or when you have optional arguments. Or many
[20:38:10] <pyzozord> I agree, adding named arguments seems like a useful tool for sure
[20:38:37] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: on the other hand, when you add named arguments, you need to add explicit "currying" on named parameters, and the next question arises "what about namespaces"
[20:38:46] <pyzozord> so your question was more like "why don't we use that higher level abstraction more commonly" then
[20:38:53] <ProfSimm> pyzozord:  imagine you have a function where you pass, say, coordinates for three points.
[20:39:07] <ProfSimm> pyzozord:  you could do x1, y1, x2, y2, ...
[20:39:09] <pyzozord> not "why is this base thing requiring order"
[20:39:17] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: or you could do point1, point2, point3

[20:39:46] <nomagno> Named parameters are a thing
[20:39:50] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: and here's the question... should you be able to partially apply the x coordinate of say point 2
[20:40:14] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: this makes partial application not just over named args, but over nested arg
[20:40:30] <pyzozord> yes like currying with named arguments

[21:09:19] <ProfSimm> bjs: what's your personal opinion, is it useful to blur the lines between input and output, or rather a pointless complication. It's kinda like Actor model (one-way messages) vs function calls (request -> response). The former is maybe more fundamental, but hard to coordinate and manage
[21:09:22] <bjs> ProfSimm: prolog is not perfect, and has lots of limitations (and as you play around you'll get a feel for why those limitations exist, e.g. try it with the factorial function I mentioned earlier).  Since it uses a lot of backtracking 
[21:10:39] <bjs> ProfSimm: it depends what you're doing, sometimes it's nice to blur the lines so you can produce a thing and then query it.  But there are times where the input/output distinction is useful (e.g. specifically with functions it's often quite nice to think about input -> output rather than rel(D,C))
[21:11:56] <ProfSimm> bjs: I'm usually in the "everything is a tool in your toolbox, use best tool for the jobs" mindset. But right now I'm trying hard to figure out "what's the most foundational approach to build everything else upon" and I can't figure it out
[21:12:35] <bjs> ProfSimm: I think that's the wrong approach,  there probably isn't *a* fundamental thing (or if there is, it's certainly not the paradigm you want to program in)
[21:12:43] <ProfSimm> bjs: in quantum mechanics every law of physics seems reversible. Nature seems to pick no direction of input to output in a way
[21:12:58] <vdamewood> Oh, yeah, I need to double check to see if there's a reason to get two or more I/O controllers
[21:13:17] <ProfSimm> bjs: on the other hand, the existence of time, coupled with the direction of time, clearly points to input->output relationship as in cause->effect
[21:13:27] <bjs> more likely is there's lots of paradigms (object-orientated, logic programming, functional, imperative etc) which each make different problems easier to reason about, even if there is some more fundamental thing that underpins each of them
[21:14:08] <ProfSimm> bjs: on the third hand, apparently cause and effect are an illusion, and actually emerge from "effect-antieffect" relationship in entangled systems, that we only subjectively perceive to follow one another depending on our PoV
[21:14:24] <ProfSimm> bjs: so fml
[21:14:38] <ProfSimm> bjs: O'
[21:14:55] <ProfSimm> bjs: I'm willing to accept it may not be the paradigm I won't program in. I can build a set of "facades" on top of it.
[21:15:10] <ProfSimm> bjs: but I want the bottom-most layer to be the right one
[21:16:15] <ProfSimm> bjs: naturally I may look into how CPUs work, I mean they deal with literally "unary" code. Can't get any simpler than "one thing" (where the lack of the thing is our second encoding which makes it a binary system)
[21:16:42] <bjs> ProfSimm: what do you mean by unary? 
[21:19:36] <ProfSimm> bjs: well I mean, on the cpu there isn't one and zero. There's only a structure through which power flows through N of M possible paths at every step. This signal is the only thing that exists in the system. It's like having "1" without having a "0". The "0" emerges only through synchronisation, when one path delivers signal and simultaneously another does or doesn't (1 or 0).

[21:28:06] <vdamewood> Hmm...  the 65XX only supports one one general interrupt vector, so I guess I can only haveone controller, unless I figure out a way to wire up two controllers.
[21:28:32] <ProfSimm> bjs: it's all very ad-hoc in a way. No clear formality to follow

[21:30:50] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: I thought of that, but that would only get me one extra I/O device.
[21:31:19] <vdamewood> (the controller supports two. And, of course, the second controller would take one of the parent controller's I/O interfaces.)

[21:44:13] <vdamewood> Nope. I'm wrong.
[21:45:17] <vdamewood> I looked it up. The 6-letter codes were the normal "always yield value XX for address YYYY" codes. The 8-letter codes were "IF address YYYY is ZZ then yield XX instead, instead yield the value present instead."

[21:46:04] <vdamewood> s/instead yield the value present instead./otherwise uield the value present/
[21:46:38] <vdamewood> The 8-letter codes were setup that way to protect against modifying a bank-swapped value when the wrong bank was loaded.
[21:52:54] <vdamewood> Oh, and an 8-letter code apparently couldn't be used if the expected value was 00, it would be treated as a 6-letter code in that case.

[23:55:18] <edgar-rft> no, but that might be because I had no idea that they exist or what they do
[23:56:42] <vdamewood> edgar-rft: They're binary boolean operations. IMPLY is true IFF a is true. NIMPLY is NOT the result of an IMPLY.
[23:57:16] <edgar-rft> ah, I thought nimply is when something's nimple enough :-)
[23:57:39] <vdamewood> Actually, no. My explanation of IMPLY is wrong.
[23:57:55] <edgar-rft> what language is that?
[23:58:13] <edgar-rft> programming language of course :-)

[23:59:06] <user51> good day. i realized i suck at job interviews.
[23:59:24] <vdamewood> edgar-rft: No particular programming language.
