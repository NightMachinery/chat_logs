[19:00:58] <arcturus> theres no way to falsify the simulation thing, i think
[19:07:28] <amigojapan> arcturus: but isn't it still true even if it is a simulation?
[19:08:11] <hexeme> amigojapan: it depends on your metaphysics and epistemology
[19:08:49] <arcturus> you could define reality based on consensus with other perceived agents yeah
[19:08:53] <amigojapan> I see hexeme
[19:08:58] <hexeme> Solipsism is a consistent epistemology where in no other agents even exist.
[19:09:13] <hexeme> And yet, it has an accounting of reality as the contents of mental phenomena.
[19:09:29] <hexeme> So it's not going to be a universal platitude in that regard.
[19:09:52] <amigojapan> hexeme: but then dreams and hallucinations wold be real too
[19:10:09] <hexeme> amigojapan: yes but not other people, who's consensus you predicated reality upon
[19:10:23] <amigojapan> True

[19:11:46] <hexeme> amigojapan: that said, in most of the modern world, an "externalist reliabilism" is taken
[19:11:57] <amigojapan> hexeme: what do you call the metaphisics I subscribe to? Where dreams and hallucinations are subjective while reality is objective?
[19:11:58] <hexeme> under that epistemology, consensus it not a bad heuristic
[19:12:08] <hexeme> amigojapan: externalist reliablism
[19:12:17] <hexeme> though that's an epistemology, not a metaphysics
[19:12:37] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[19:13:11] <hexeme> Well it presumes a certain class of metaphysics-es I guess.
[19:14:02] <amigojapan> hexeme: I think I escaped from solipsism by an act of blind faith in reality being real
[19:15:00] <hexeme> amigojapan: It is true of all epistemologies that given that they start from the same place, none of them are formally more appealing than any other.
[19:15:05] <arcturus> as does everyone probably
[19:15:18] <hexeme> But it's not clear how solipsism could lead to empiricism, technology, modern prosperity, etc
[19:15:35] <hexeme> So some are better than others in that regard. But philosophically speaking, they're all on perfectly equal ground.
[19:15:48] <arcturus> that is, no ground
[19:16:03] <amigojapan> I see
[19:16:13] <hexeme> Well, they are grounded in the basal ontology of mental phenomena
[19:17:06] <amigojapan> hexeme: for all I know, you have seen those crazy people taking to nobody on the streets. I could be one of them
[19:17:31] <arcturus> true
[19:18:02] <amigojapan> I am not 100 prevent sure externalism is reliable. But it seems that way
[19:18:07] <hexeme> amigojapan: If you're looking for a great introductory course on epistemology, there is one by the Great Courses I recommend to people
[19:18:27] <hexeme> You can even do it free by signing up to Audible. They give you a single item from their library for free, no matter the cost.

[19:34:18] <Panther> How can you think about what you know, unless you know what you think about?
[19:39:14] <amigojapan> Panther: how can we know everything we think about? I have bad memory. I think I would not be able to know all that. Yet I can think about what I know by analysing parts I do remember
[19:41:08] <amigojapan> Panther: I think in general I take the Socrates approach of "the only thing I know is that I know nothing at all"
[19:41:51] <amigojapan> Perhaps I know I exist too

[19:47:01] <hexeme> can only imagine what the purpose of this comment was
[19:47:12] <Panther> So, what you are saying is that you have no idea what you are talking about, because you can't remember much of it, and so you extrapolate those from nearby points to create a consistent, yet false reality.
[19:47:32] * hexeme blinks.
[19:47:48] <hexeme> Panther: bored?
[19:47:59] <Panther> Kinda
[19:48:05] <Panther> I just got up, too :)
[19:48:13] <amigojapan> Panther: I don't think anyone knows everything they think. I am probably average in that
[19:49:01] <Panther> I am not sure I know anything that I don't think, at least if I don't think I know it, and particularly if I know I don't think it.
[19:49:47] <hexeme> The model where in knowledge is only the contents of conscious thought is probably one we can disregard.
[19:50:43] <Panther> What if we don't disregard it?
[19:51:30] <amigojapan> True hexeme we even have Wikipedia now
[19:51:53] <hexeme> Panther: You need coffee, your contributions are amounting to mashing words together.
[19:52:16] <Panther> You have to have more than one model, or you can't determine which one is the most parsimonious. :)
[19:52:57] <hexeme> There's an infinite number of whimsical models we don't consider.
[19:53:13] <Panther> Oh? How many do you consider?
[19:53:30] <hexeme> google "epistemologies"
[19:53:41] <Panther> I don't need to do that.

[19:56:20] <amigojapan> hexeme: I am glad I have graduated from solipsism, even if I don't know for sure if it is true. But it was lonely when I thought it was
[19:57:09] <hexeme> amigojapan: if anything, it just doesn't lead anywhere
[19:57:19] <hexeme> there's not much to say if you pick it
[19:57:59] <hexeme> pretty boring road given the alternatives
[20:00:21] <amigojapan> hexeme: but I don't think everyone can easily graduate from it. For me, it took a step of blind faith that other people are real. I think it is important to tell people how to escape
[20:00:45] <hexeme> amigojapan: "blind faith" isn't really a recommendation that's useful to other people
[20:01:13] <hexeme> the fact that other epistemologies can lead somewhere non-trivial is probably the appropriate salespitch.
[20:01:32] <amigojapan> hexeme: in what other way can you escape it when you are sure it is true?
[20:01:41] <hexeme> I just said
[20:01:52] <amigojapan> Yeah you ninjaed me
[20:01:57] <hexeme> hehe
[20:02:19] <amigojapan> Ok I will keep that in mind
