[00:04:27] <sd> 12<R​oca> I recently started learning Linux shell/terminal to manage our cloud server which hosts our website (which I coded) and also an internal wiki. I am asking about Active Directory because I'm wondering if there is a benefit to setting something like that up either on prem or off-prem (if its even possible) in a linux permutation since AD is a Microsoft thing...

[00:10:54] <sd> 13<m​oquito64> AD is great at scale. For 5 you might not see the immediate benefits but when you scale an Operation to 100 it starts making more sense. (You can add Linux boxes to AD, centralized place for users and computer directory)

[11:13:33] <Cl0udNinja> I do my best to avoid doing my career job on the weekends
[11:13:41] <Cl0udNinja> or after hours lol
[11:13:55] <sd> 02<r​yalln> ahh
[11:14:01] <sd> 02<r​yalln> but i can trade 1 hour for 1.5 hours
[11:14:19] <Cl0udNinja> you mean pay>?
[11:14:24] <sd> 02<r​yalln> tiem in lue
[11:15:11] <Cl0udNinja> ah, am salary, and we dont really track hours. boss is also pretty adamant about us having ample time off / taking time off
[11:15:44] <sd> 02<r​yalln> al I wish is that business would accept that IT should have the ability to test shit middle of the day 😄
[11:16:56] <Cl0udNinja> lol yeah, I know how that goes. last place I worked, the company operated 9a-9p, so testing/deploying anything during that time was impossible, was always ridiculous late nights and shit
[11:17:18] <Cl0udNinja> and then they wanted us to support 3 more stores, and I lost it
[11:18:11] <sd> 02<r​yalln> yeah dont blame ya
[11:18:24] <sd> 02<r​yalln> im happy my sites have like 2-30 people and most of those laptop users so eh
[11:18:37] <sd> 02<r​yalln> but its just bigger shit. Expecting me to test shit late at night = tired and mistakes
[11:19:15] <Cl0udNinja> this was a place where you went and paid for a VR experience, thankfully didnt have to support any of the IT systems to run the store, but all of the infra for the VR stuff was on me and one other
[11:19:33] <sd> 02<r​yalln> let guess, at the start was fun
[11:19:36] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I started turning 2 days into 1 because of that
[11:19:37] <sd> 02<r​yalln> then it turned into work 😄
[11:19:41] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[11:20:11] <Cl0udNinja> I used to show up to work at like 9a, work to 3 or so, and then I'd go home, sleep, and then work from like 8p to 2a
[11:20:16] <sd> 02<r​yalln> fuck dat
[11:20:18] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[11:20:20] <sd> 02<r​yalln> work life balance
[11:20:41] <Cl0udNinja> they always talked about it, but they were too busy launching new stores before we could support the last one to hear the complaints
[11:21:04] <sd> 02<r​yalln> they would of been making money faster then the where loosing it
[11:21:18] <Cl0udNinja> another reason I'm happy where I am right now. if we work past 6 or 7 more than a few nights in a row boss is like 'yall need to chill, go take a day off'

But I need to work on that setup sometimes.
[22:43:49] <JollyRgrs> pretty sure if you're doing like RDP, you can do that just fine. If you are trying to "remote view" then obviously you can only use what they are physically showing
[22:44:57] <sd> 08<J​TR> ConnectWise Control can show multiple monitors at once, although it can't split them into individual windows (it just puts them side by side in a very large window).
[22:45:51] <sd> 08<J​TR> oh wait, the computer only has one monitor?
[22:46:04] <sd> 08<J​TR> I think I got it backwards, never mind, lol
[22:46:36] <sd> 14<N​oob> Fairly sure I enabled RDP for myself already. Let me check. And I guess showing their single screen expanded across both of my monitors would be good enough. I just want to have a program open on each screen from their computer.
[22:47:02] <JollyRgrs> you need to setup RDP specifically to use 2 monitors
[22:47:10] <JollyRgrs> i hadn't done that in so long... but i'm sure you could google it
[22:47:23] <sd> 08<J​TR> Yeah you're looking to do the opposite of what I thought you were. Not sure how you'd do that. I'd try JollyRgrs' suggestion.
