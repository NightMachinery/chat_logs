[00:13:04] <flakland> at minimum it should be able to pass that FIPS randomness test that's floating around the net
[00:13:07] <InPhase> Realistically most IQ tests also start to lose numerical validity outside of about 2-3 standard deviations.

[00:33:29] <CaCode-> I wonder if clumsyness could be measured in a standardized test yielding a CQ
[00:33:40] <CaCode-> 100 CQ being the average persons clumsyness
[00:33:42] <pyzozord> I guess my point is that high IQ creates inherit advantage in life, but of course that advantage needs to be taken of

[00:34:18] <pulse> IQ measures a tiny band of intelligence and it tells you almost nothing about how good that person is at life
[00:34:23] <oldlaptop> Are those problems caused by their high IQ?
[00:34:24] <pulse> At least in my humble opinion
[00:34:28] <Bou> dumb people are happier in general
[00:34:31] <pulse> Emotional intelligence is arguably more important
[00:34:39] <pulse> Yet you don't hear that, it's always IQ, IQ, IQ
[00:35:07] <pulse> oldlaptop, No, but there is a tendency for smart people to end up unfulfilled in other areas of life
[00:35:10] <pyzozord> I'd argue that I never really heard about corelation between IQ and social skills. If anything I'd assume that higher IQ person can navigate social complexities more skilfully (if they choose)
[00:35:22] <pulse> pyzozord, Fallacy
[00:35:24] <pyzozord> (assuming all other things being equal)

[00:36:07] <arahael> pyzozord: you could almost even claim the opposite.
[00:36:08] <pulse> The point is that IQ is largely irrelevant, and what it measures can be learned
[00:36:19] <pulse> I can train IQ tests until I get 170 IQ, does that mean I have 170 IQ?
[00:36:27] <pulse> Or does it just mean I've put in the time to get good at arbitrary logic puzzles
[00:36:34] <CaCode-> the time it takes you to run 100 m is a bad measure for a persons speed

[06:57:00] <Quietwalker> UDP still requires an ip address and port, though you can use UDP broadcast.  Stateless has nothing to do with the connection in this case, it just means that you give up the tcp features like reliability and concurrency
[06:57:38] <SenoraRaton> I also gain the ability to "flood" the network with UDP packets, and if clients are listening they can interpet the data, and the server doesn't have to know that the clients even exist right?
[06:57:52] <Quietwalker> of course, you have to be in the same network for udp broadcast
[06:57:57] <Quietwalker> er the same subnet
[06:58:08] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[06:58:13] <Quietwalker> that's correct
[06:58:30] <SenoraRaton> Exactly, which is the entire reason why I'm using UDP to transmit data because I want network locked communications in a specific geographic area(the building the network resides in)
[06:59:15] <SenoraRaton> So what is the "ip address" in this case?  Stack overflow states: INADDR_ANY instructs listening socket to bind to all available interfaces. It's the same as trying to bind to inet_addr("0.0.0.0")

[07:22:29] <SenoraRaton> So your telling me what I want to do isn't possible?
[07:22:54] <SenoraRaton> I can't just have a computer that is mointoring a UDP port, and then broadcast from a second computer to the network, and recieve that data on the first machine.
[07:23:15] <SenoraRaton> Or ANY/ALL machines listening to that UDP port on the network.
[07:24:57] <arahael> These machines are on the same physical network?

[07:29:14] <arahael> Oh, using *iOS*?
[07:29:38] <SenoraRaton> No, I am not.
[07:30:13] <SenoraRaton> I am currently using a native application on my computer.  The client side code is going to be written for Android/IOS and web, although at this point all I'm troubleshooting is the local client
[07:30:30] <SenoraRaton> Well, I have my laptop running as the client, and my desktop is the server at the moment.
[07:30:43] <arahael> SenoraRaton: Well, I'm not sure if iOS will listen to broadcast.
[07:30:52] <smallville7123> is this a bug? https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/694002
[07:30:53] <bayaz> Title: trackpad driver bug | Apple Developer Forums 
[07:32:21] <SenoraRaton> @arahael Sure, thats a problem for future me.  Current me just wants to establish the proper broadcast from the server, and ensure I can communicate with a client, and then I can worry about how various client architectures deal with interfacing to the server.

[07:35:42] <SenoraRaton> I'm not sure how that is gonna work.  The issue is I want to broadcast to a local network, but I need to know who is ON the network in order to broadcast to them, but UDP lets me not care who is on the network, I can just broadcast, and the clients can either recieve if avaliable, or not recieve and the server doesn't care about the outcome
[07:36:19] <SenoraRaton> Also UDP avoids locks that TCP may create.  The server I'm running it on is intentionally avoiding such things for compatibilty and stability reasons
[07:37:28] <arahael> TCP doesn't create locks.

[13:43:40] <pyzozord> vdamewood: so if message receiver returns then it kind of converts from the "message world" to "function world" in some sense
[13:45:00] <pyzozord> oh right so messages are just like functions but the binding is a bit looser, you could sent a message to an object that doesn't handle it and that wouldn't crash the program?

[16:14:20] <Inst> wait
[16:14:21] <[itchyjunk]> You know they have an app for that
[16:14:27] <Inst> do you guys know
[16:14:32] <[itchyjunk]> nope
[16:14:35] <Inst> whether an open file dialogue
[16:14:39] <Inst> is created by windows GUI
[16:14:43] <Inst> or by the software?
[16:15:10] <d3x0r> the windows open file dialog is pretty lame - .NET has one 
[16:15:18] <d3x0r> not sure if you count that one as system or software...
[16:15:30] <d3x0r> but most are either custom or not the windows default one
[16:16:01] <d3x0r> java has its own
[16:16:15] <routeveg> Open file dialogue is a COM+ component I believe
[16:16:52] <routeveg> So, it lives in a COM library, the code that wants to use it creates the relevant windows APIs to create an instance of that
[16:17:03] <Inst> i'm trying to figure out how to get Haskell to create an open file dialogue in windows
[16:17:06] <Inst> i'm probably out of luck?
[16:17:51] <[itchyjunk]> Java, if i have a try catch inside a method that expects a return type of say `Type` and i return that inside the try block, does it still complain about not having the current return type?

[17:01:40] <ski> pyzozord : hm (i got side-tracked with something else, for a while) .. an adjunction is a kind of weaker form of the notion of an inverse, relying on a given ordering (or, a graph (more or less .. actually a category), in general). the left adjunct of something doesn't need to be the same as the right adjunct. one is a kind of "approximation from below", the other an "approximation from above". e.g. 
[17:01:46] <ski> `floor' is left adjoint to the coercion inclusion mapping integers to corresponding reals, which in turn have `ceiling' as right adjoint. in logic, conjunction, disjunction, universal and existential quantification, as well as equality, are all adjunctions. in algebra (including set theory), various kinds of "products" and "sums" are adjunctions, as well as "free" (and "cofree") constructions, e.g. 
[17:01:52] <ski> given a set, generate a vector space with that set as basis. or given a group, force it to become commutative, by identifying as few as possible elements
[17:02:38] <ski> computing connected components in a graph is a left adjoint of building a discrete graph (no edges) from a set, which is left adjoint to taking the set of nodes in a graph
