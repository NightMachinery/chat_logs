[02:24:50] <two2thehead> ggreer, dunno. It's self-report/owner-report
[02:27:15] <ggreer> some breeds seem domesticated enough to understand the names we give them, obey commands, follow and defend their owners, go for walks on a leash, and generally not attack humans (even tiny babies who randomly grab/poke them)
[02:29:26] <two2thehead> I like how in youtube vids, I haven't seen a single dog attack or complain about a grabby baby, but most cats tend to 'nope out' or scratch the baby
[02:29:35] <feep> cats are great, but ... what if dog
[02:29:45] <ggreer> certain dog breeds will murder babies

[02:32:52] <two2thehead> did she/he bite the cat's ears? that's something babies do
[02:33:25] <ggreer> no. the kid (a baby boy) mostly just pets and sorta grabs chunks of the cat's body clumsily
[02:33:39] <ggreer> sometimes he'll lay on top of the cat

[02:42:02] <ggreer> schaub retired a couple years after that fight. I think he was 32 when he gave up the gloves
[02:42:23] <ggreer> not a smart guy but he definitely made a wise decision to stop before he got a ton of damage

[03:06:52] <catern> wtf that pie looks good
[03:07:10] <two2thehead> a travesty! ;_;
[03:07:16] <catern> t. pumpkin pie connoisseur
[03:07:30] <gwern> catern: doesn't look nearly as good as the 3 other options
[03:07:46] <saturn2> "Danila Medvedev, her former husband and now rival commented on the event relatively peacefully: ‚ÄúIt seems to me that this whole story also has a positive side. At the very least, we get an interesting answer to the objection ‚Äúwho will need these cryopatients in the future?‚Äù If even now, when, in the opinion of ordinary people, this is just a bunch of frozen bodies; there are those who are ready to
[03:07:47] <saturn2> fight for cryopatients. Thus, over time, as the reality and the likelihood of revival gradually grows, I think, and the value of cryopatients will also grow.‚Äù (In Telegram chat ‚ÄúOpen cryonics‚Äù)."
[03:07:50] <gwern> I'm squinting at this and that's some odd looking filling for a pumpkin pie, I don't care how many fancy leaf cookies you put on top
[03:08:37] <catern> gwern: disagree, the filling looks good and the other options look basic
[03:08:59] <saturn2> ok but i doubt we can count on an endless supply of vengeful ex-spouses to take over
[03:09:28] <gwern> the basic reality that Shoe0nHead seems to be in denial about is that most people have been burned by extremely bland pumpkin pies out of cans, and if you give them 3 other options which look much more flavorful, on a day they're stuffed, they're going to take them
[03:09:29] <catern> but you know what they say, de gustibus pugnare usque ad mortem

[03:13:37] <catern> it's pretty high quality
[03:15:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The filling looks standard
[03:15:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But pumpkin pie in general is kind of a lame dessert
[03:15:28] <catern> compared to the $40 pumpkin pie from "the absolute best" pie in NYC (petee's pie), the costco pumpkin pie really held its own
[03:16:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> The other three things are ... some sort of ... maybe an apple upside down cake with cream cheese?? That's a guess
[03:16:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then there's what looks like a coconut layer cake
[03:16:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And... I want to say it's a glazed bundt cake of some sort? (Probably apple spice or something?)
[03:17:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some kind of cookies there too... hard to say what sort... sugar? Lemon?
[03:18:15] <catern> sesame seed clearly
[03:18:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I thought that too at first but I am not sure

[03:19:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not that weird tbh
[03:20:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Huh, with the slice taken out of it, that pie looks even less appetizing

[04:20:11] <ggreer> - Charlie is a 40-year old inadequate with seven convictions for burglary. He‚Äôs spent seventeen of the last twenty-five years in prison. Although not very intelligent he is cunning and experienced; he has picked up a lot of ‚Äòlore‚Äô during his spells inside. He steals from small shops and suburban houses, taking whatever he thinks he can sell to local fences.
[04:20:11] <ggreer> - Bruno is a ‚Äògentleman criminal‚Äô. His business is mostly stealing art. As a cover, he runs a small art gallery. He has a (forged) university degree in art history on the wall, and one conviction for robbery eighteen years ago. After two years in jail, he changed his name and moved to a different part of the country. He has done occasional ‚Äòblack bag‚Äô jobs for intelligence agencies who know his past. He‚Äôd like to get into 
[04:20:11] <ggreer> computer crime, but the most he‚Äôs done so far is stripping $100,000 worth of memory chips from a university‚Äôs PCs back in the mid-1990s when there was a memory famine.
[04:20:11] <ggreer> - Abdurrahman heads a cell of a dozen militants, most with military training. They have infantry weapons and explosives, with PhD-grade technical support provided by a disreputable country. Abdurrahman himself came third out of a class of 280 at the military academy of that country but was not promoted because he‚Äôs from the wrong ethnic group. He thinks of himself as a good man rather than a bad man. His mission is to steal plutonium.

[05:05:43] <catern> "So Bruno‚Äôs next attack is to wait for a dark and stormy night. He sets off the alarm somehow, taking care not to get caught on CCTV or otherwise leave any hard evidence that the alarm was a real one. He retires a few hundred yards and hides in the bushes. The guards come out and find nothing. He waits half an hour and sets off the alarm again. This time the guards don‚Äôt bother, so in he goes." "Deliberately induced false alarms are
[05:05:43] <catern> especially effective against sites that don‚Äôt have round-the-clock guards. Many police forces have a policy that after a certain number of false alarms from a given site (typically three to five in a year), they will no longer send a squad car there until the alarm company, or another keyholder, has been there to check." what an interesting attack! this can apply to many things - you could wait for incidental load or weather or
[05:05:43] <catern> something to launch a denial of service, and trick the operators into thinking it's the incidental environment that caused the denial of service, when actually it's under your control... seems like a powerful tool

[06:17:32] <adiabatic> there was a _long_ lag between the song coming out and the term getting popular

[06:20:15] <CoJaBo> The first I can rememer seeing it is in a rant from someone complaining that "dream stans are cray", and it didn't even look english

However, since the absorbing diffusion model is trained to approximate p(z0

To achieve similar results in the downstream COCO captioning task, the base model must see more than 2 to 8 times more samples in pretraining.

[07:21:00] <adiabatic> is it just me or was in-browser RSS kind of shit
[07:21:15] <adiabatic> you get a list of links in your bookmarks bar, whoop de doo

[07:24:07] <adiabatic> if it's just a dozen updates a day, you just visit, say, volokh.com over and over throughout the day
[07:24:20] <saturn2> firefox had a better rss reader before "smart bookmarks"

[08:07:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if you can do recursive prompt tuning
[08:08:08] <PapuaHardyNet> that is, keep adding newer layers that you finetune with task-focused data 
[08:09:37] <gwern> as in, multiple heads? or stacking them? if you stack them, seems like you'd wind up cutting off your signal from the original model as it goes through bottleneck after bottlenck. there's no reason tuned task A will be a good input for tuning on task B
[08:11:25] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, I didn't mean different tasks, I meant as you collect more and more data for one specific task A, you keep adding more and more layers (stacking) via prompt tuning to make it perform better on that task
[08:14:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I imagine one could run GPT-3 on the cloud, pipe the output of the decoder into a local GPT-2 (or another transformer architecture), which is specifically fine tuned for the task of AI Dungeon, which should therefore give much better results than naively using GPT-3
[08:14:47] <gwern> greedy layerwise training is usually worse, and prompt tuning is cheap, so it'd make more sense to just periodically train a larger prompt tuning from scratch, I'd think
[08:14:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I'll keep that in mind
[08:16:06] <gwern> feeding GPT-3 output into GPT-2 is not really equivalent. remember, gpt-3 learns much better low-dimensional representations which can be controlled. that's how a lot of this prompt finetuning stuff works: you need only a few parameters because you're not encoding anything *new*, you're merely reweighting the emphasis on what it's already learned
[08:16:25] <gwern> if GPT-2 was smart enough to understand all the latents like 'sarcasm', you wouldn't need GPT-3 in the first place
[08:20:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I see

[12:26:27] <Robomot> Covid-19 Vaccines and Allergies - Anaphylaxis Campaign (Do you have questions about the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and your allergy? We have brought together a list of the most frequently asked questions with answers compiled with the assistance of our expert clinical panel.)
[12:26:36] <kuudes> _"
[12:26:36] <kuudes> The Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGs (also known as macrogols) are a group of known allergens commonly found in medicines, many household products and cosmetics. Medicines containing PEG include some tablets, laxatives, depot steroid injections, and some bowel preparations used before colonoscopy. Known allergy to PEG is rare but has been implicated in a minority of allergic reactions reported.
[12:26:36] <kuudes> The rate of anaphylaxis reported to date to the AstraZeneca vaccine is in line with the expected rate of anaphylaxis to non-COVID vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine does not contain PEG but does contain a related compound called polysorbate 80. Rarely people with PEG allergy may also be allergic to polysorbate 80. However, polysorbate 80 is widely used in medicines and foods, and is present in many medicines including monoclonal antibody preparations. Some 
[12:26:40] <kuudes> injected influenza vaccines (including the main vaccine used in over 65 year olds) contain polysorbate 80. Individuals who have tolerated injections that contain polysorbate 80 (including the adjuvanted influenza vaccine, Fluad¬Æ and the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine Fluarix¬Æ) are likely to tolerate the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[12:26:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: The idea is that you develop an allergy to PEG and thereafter your immune system attacks any PEG-ylated thing and destroys it, which prevents any PEG-ylated vaccine from working
[12:26:44] <kuudes> "
[12:26:56] <kuudes> you could take astrazeneca per this

[12:27:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: THis is all irrelevant to what I am saying
[12:27:33] <kuudes> :-/
[12:27:35] <ggreer> but you can still find J&J if you really want it. you can even get a booster of it
[12:27:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> The concern is not "PEG vaccines will cause me to have an allergic reaction in the sense that I go into anaphylactic shock or something similarly horrible"
[12:28:07] <kuudes> so what is it?
[12:28:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> The concern is "PEG vaccines will in fact *do nothing*"
[12:28:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scroll up, I explained it to ggreer
[12:28:22] <kuudes> yes. but astrazeneca does not contain that stuff

[12:28:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> J&J is, though

[12:29:06] <kuudes> it is not that much less effective
[12:29:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (AZ also is, probably even worse, right?)

[12:30:06] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, personally I am in the camp "getting covid does not give you very good immunity"
[12:30:13] <kuudes> as evidenced by you getting it twice
[12:30:34] <kuudes> and indeed 2x moderna still gets benefit from getting a booster
[12:30:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Personally I am in the camp "don't start flailing around and doing random shit because you feel like Something Needs To Be Done"
[12:31:05] <kuudes> booster is not random but instead *really really* effective
[12:31:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, that's not my understanding at all

[12:31:59] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, yes
[12:32:06] <kuudes> in israel they have not used anything but mrna
[12:32:19] <kuudes> and they got much breakthroughs -> they started third doses -> it was solved
[12:32:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... yes? Really? They've had a lot of test subjects who've gotten 2x booster AND actual covid?
[12:32:22] <kuudes> yes
[12:32:28] <kuudes> national covid spread even
[12:32:33] <kuudes> which was stopped with boosters.
[12:32:53] <kuudes> now we have 1 person who has got 3 doses of mrna in israel and has got omicron
[12:33:09] <kuudes> out of 4 persons in israel so far confirmed with omicron
[12:33:21] <kuudes> so 3 doses may be not enough against omicron
[12:34:05] <kuudes> 2 doses was enough against wuhan, but delta was 1000x more infective, but booster was enough against it. omicron is again factor more infective, but it may be we just need even more boosters
[12:34:24] <kuudes> well, not 1000x more infective, but 1000x more virus production
[12:34:32] <kuudes> something like 2-3x more infective
[12:34:47] <feep> aw fuvk
[12:35:34] <kuudes> we are dealing with exponent scale here. it is nice each dose gives us exponent increase as well, so we can match and overcome virus evolution exponents

[12:48:56] <kuudes> it is good. I strongly encourage taking it. so does your local health people. you could ask your doctor on opinion but I don't know how things work for you there
[12:49:30] <kuudes> there is an opinion that people should fall ill instead of getting boosted and that opinion is imo insane
[12:49:56] <kuudes> but indeed it seems that some in for instance our health authorities are for getting people ill instead of letting them get boosters

[12:50:25] <kuudes> sure. but we already have those boosters and they have been already paid for

[12:55:51] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, it means they don't want to give you boosters but admin has forced them to allow them, so they grudgingly allow you to get boosters
[12:56:15] <PapuaHardyNet> bureaucrats, smh
[12:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: What I think is that Facebook does some kind of weird IP-based determination about who to show stuff without logging in and who to ask for login
[12:56:24] <kuudes> indeed as was discussed with ggreer before, in the near past it was not allwoed for people to get boosters.
[12:56:25] <feep> the thumb clusters will definitely be the largest change to get used to
[12:56:29] <kuudes> not in usa, not in finland
[12:56:50] <feep> alt-tab is sooo far now!! :(

[12:57:09] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: that should not be possible unless they can break tor...
[12:57:20] <kuudes> because the medical authority does not see need for people to avoid getting infected, only to avoid crowding hospitals
[12:57:27] <kuudes> you know, health is not about health etc
[12:57:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No but it could just be coincidence
[12:57:57] <kuudes> saturn2, are you sure facebook does not side channel with trackers?
[12:58:00] <feep> luckily I have big hands... with which I keep hitting capslock instead of shift, lol.
[12:58:01] <ggreer> a couple of my friends got boosters before it was allowed by the authorities. here if you want a shot, you get a shot. there are plenty of doses so nobody cares
[12:58:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: i.e., for w/e reason, the IP of your current exit node is one they've decided should get the login demand
[12:58:19] <kuudes> ggreer, indeed, low legibility of state is an advantage for that
[12:58:25] <saturn2> .onion sites do not have exit nodes
[12:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess I'm not sure what that means

[12:58:51] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: whaextra kwys, this thing has less keys than a normal keyboard :p
[12:58:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're connecting to Facebook from *some* IP
[12:59:18] <saturn2> kuudes: i'm not sure but the whole point of tor browser is to prevent that

[12:59:44] <PapuaHardyNet> facebook f'd a guy who used tails + tor
[12:59:47] <kuudes> if you put it into a vm which has no other internet connections but tor, then you can be quite certain
[12:59:57] <PapuaHardyNet> it was a zero day, but keep that in mind
[13:00:04] <feep> lol typos like that are what happens when I look at the keyboard instead the chat when typing
[13:00:22] <kuudes> why do you use such keyboard feep?
[13:00:26] <rsaarelm> feep: Fun thing with my Kinesis Advantage, the thumb cluster default keys are dumb (delete in top spot, who uses delete ever?) and I needed to remap them.
[13:00:29] <saturn2> they aren't using zero days to decide who to show their login wall, come on
[13:00:53] <kuudes> don't they do that on all tor connections?
[13:01:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think they're breaking tor or w/e
[13:01:12] <feep> kuudes: better wrist position, it's definitely already noticeable.
[13:01:22] <PapuaHardyNet> lol, imagine burning a zero day anytime someone uses the onion facebook link

[13:04:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, there you go then, maybe they decided to show the login wall to that IP
[13:04:35] <feep> ooh alt on pagedown seems like a solid idea, I can see that being nicer for alt-tab
[13:04:45] <feep> do 
[13:04:53] <feep> dyouo....
[13:05:12] <rsaarelm> Do they still have those nasty rubber keys for esc and the function keys?
[13:05:18] <feep> do you physically swap the keys?
[13:05:25] <feep> yea lol
[13:05:37] <feep> oh no hang on
[13:05:39] <rsaarelm> No.
[13:06:06] <feep> they're smaller but they're proper keys, yeah
[13:06:08] <rsaarelm> I'm not sure how many of them can be, obviously the big keycaps need to stay as is.
[13:06:29] <rsaarelm> I have a Kinesis from around 2014 and the rubber esc key broke after 5 years of use.
[13:06:42] <feep> lol
[13:07:19] <rsaarelm> I have a press-and-release-capslock-is-esc xcape mapping going so it's no big deal in desktop use, but games don't understand it so I needed to hw-remap one of the useless other keys (printscreen?) as esc.
[13:07:27] <feep> anyway gonna hook up my new roomba and then shower, bbl
[13:07:48] <feep> 2+2=4

[16:49:48] <PapuaHardyNet> monero is basically a stable coin at this point

[16:50:11] <PapuaHardyNet> in comparison to other cryptocurrencies that aren't actually stablecoins I mean
[16:50:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I didn't say monero's price is at 1$, but I am saying that monero's prices are very inelastic
[16:51:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I think everyone should own monero though
[16:51:34] <Khoth> why?
[16:52:05] <shawwwn> because if a coin has been flat for a long time, then historically it won't be for much longer
[16:52:12] <PapuaHardyNet> extremely decentralized mining, privacy is a first class feature of the currency which means it is FUNGIBLE
[16:52:30] <PapuaHardyNet> it is, in my opinion, what satoshi nakamoto had in mind when he built bitcoin
[16:53:39] <Khoth> why own it rather than wait until some circumstance arises where I'd want to spend it and buy it then?
[16:54:04] <PapuaHardyNet> because the true bottlenecks for monero are the onramps and offramps
[16:54:19] <PapuaHardyNet> getting your hands on monero is harder than getting your hands on normal cryptocurrencies
[16:54:37] <shawwwn> I prefer a simpler explanation:

[18:50:48] <Gurkenglas> hanlons fusion reactor: why not both
[18:52:48] <Gurkenglas> wouldn't the virus evolve towards bigger and bigger leaps of evolution? or does that require more selection than we've seen?
[18:53:00] <kuudes> I don't know
[18:53:21] <kuudes> btw if it was natural, why didn't it jump out when it had half of these mutations?
[18:53:34] <kuudes> afaik the natural theory is that it was months inside an aids person
[18:54:02] <Gurkenglas> do other viruses do that in aids people?
[18:54:29] <kuudes> I don't know
[18:55:06] <kuudes> but apparently normally variants have 1 or a couple of mutations from about known pool of possibly useful mutations, and this has 50+
[18:55:29] <kuudes> gwern, how do you see it?
[18:55:58] <Gurkenglas> you'd think the aids person would die after one of the 30-mutation variants is more lethal
[18:56:00] <gwern> deliberate human passaging sounds unlikely to me. you'd have to be kinda crazy to do so, and there hasn't been all that much time for it
[18:56:11] <shawwwn> https://twitter.com/gordic_aleksa/status/1464612130628542466 "wow look at me I'm so special"
[18:56:12] <vrs> if it did incubate in someone immunocompromised, I have some hope that the omicron variant is very non-deadly
[18:56:22] * shawwwn incubates in vrs
[18:56:29] <vrs> l-lewd
[18:56:29] <gwern> * deliberate passgaging by human researchers
[18:57:03] <gwern> shawwwn: he kinda is. DM doesn't hire *that* many people
[18:57:05] <kuudes> gwern, they had research ongoing on how current covid plasmas react to variants that have those new mutations
[18:57:22] <shawwwn> who cares about working at DM
[18:57:23] <gwern> yeah but that's not passaging, and you don't need to combine them all at once
[18:57:42] <gwern> and why in south africa/botswana? aren't there way more researchers elsewhere?
[18:57:52] <kuudes> maybe others were more sane
[18:57:57] <Gurkenglas> do the 50+ mutations look like the result of babble-and-prune or what you'd see after radiation exposure (just babble)?
[18:57:59] <gwern> it's not like wuhan where "oh we're the only lab in the world collecting these highly infectious bat coronaviruses"
[18:57:59] <kuudes> johannesburg has bsl-4
[18:58:04] * shawwwn mutates Gurkenglas 
[18:58:23] <shawwwn> now you're Gurkensalg
[18:58:27] <kuudes> also who has paid for south africans to reverse engineer moderna, but I don't know if that is related
[18:58:31] *** Gurkenglas is now known as Gureknglas
[18:58:33] <gwern> kuudes: but the earliest cases are also being detected elsewhere, not at johannesburg as the epicenter if you think the bsl-4 spilled over
[18:58:34] <Gureknglas> thanks a lot
[18:58:38] <shawwwn> np
[18:59:45] <kuudes> I don't know. maybe they outsourced stuff to less regulative location in poorer neighbouring country
[18:59:53] <kuudes> h1n1 arose in mexico, not in usa
[19:00:04] <Gureknglas> maybe we're just in a bubble that's more pro humanity than your average virologist
[19:00:26] <kuudes> but I don't know.
[19:00:48] <gwern> kuudes: are we claiming the 2009 h1n1 was a lab spillover? otherwise it's not relevant, or rather, shows 'arising in a poor country' needs no particular explanation
[19:00:51] <kuudes> indeed it seems unlikely anyone does so, but so seems random long chain mutation of the virus suddenly
[19:00:57] <Gureknglas> do we have other sequenced variants with many mutations?
[19:01:13] <kuudes> gwern, iirc we discussed here that with you before and you were of opinion that it is possible
[19:01:39] <gwern> hm? are you sure you aren't thinking of the influenza russian lab escape in the '70s?
[19:01:48] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[19:01:55] <kuudes> that was discussed as well, but h1n1 of 2009 too
[19:02:01] <kuudes> same discussion iirc
[19:02:11] <kuudes> of course no smoking gun
[19:02:14] <gwern> I don't remember any particular reason to think the 2009 h1n1 mexican one to have been a lab escape
[19:02:25] <kuudes> it was a weird chimera
[19:02:42] <gwern> the russian one is super-suspicious what with "world's largest active biowarfare program" and all, but mexico?
[19:04:01] <Gureknglas> omicron ground zero seems to be kwazulu natal, are any virologists around there?
[19:04:49] <Gureknglas> gauteng, more precisely
[19:05:53] <nshepperd> doing gain of function research on an active pandemic virus sounds like a rather special form of entertainment
[19:06:02] <Gureknglas> i misread - gauteng, not kwazulu natal.
[19:06:06] <kuudes> iirc usa had recently made regulations that could have been connected with moving some us research over the border

[22:33:42] <PapuaHardyNet> what is the "circle with a plus sign in it" thing in neural network architecture diagrams like this one https://litter.catbox.moe/klhtyd.png

[22:34:31] <gwern> hm, circle-plus is usually XOR... but that doesn't make sense with floats like I assume both inputs are... right?
[22:35:23] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, everything is floats. the paper is gMLPs, the architecture is gMLP with attention
[22:35:34] <PapuaHardyNet> both inputs are tensors with floats

[22:35:56] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is absolutely meaningless smh
[22:36:11] <gwern> I think you are either going to have reread the equations more carefully, or just look at their source lol
[22:36:32] <PapuaHardyNet> based on this code, it seems like you use the attention output as a mask for SGU (https://github.com/lucidrains/g-mlp-pytorch/blob/main/g_mlp_pytorch/g_mlp_pytorch.py#L198 )
