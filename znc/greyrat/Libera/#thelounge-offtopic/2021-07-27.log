[11:49:00] <fnutt> bookworm: Do you think the Oracle always free cloud vps will stay there for years to come?
[11:49:12] <bookworm> no
[11:49:17] <fnutt> If I am to move TL from Google to Oracle, it must be worth it.
[11:49:25] <fnutt> since it will be pita for me.
[11:49:33] <fnutt> Right... may I ask why you think so?
[11:49:42] <bookworm> I pay for my VPS ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[11:49:52] <bookworm> because nothing that is free stays for long
[11:49:59] <fnutt> Alright
[11:50:21] <bookworm> I had the misfortune to use a cheap VPS provider at the beginning... they closed shop with a less than 12h notice
[11:50:25] <fnutt> Google Cloud Always Free has been free for quite a few years now.
[11:50:30] <bookworm> I assume a free provider to eventually do the same
[11:50:40] <fnutt> Good point.
[11:50:43] <bookworm> or limit the usefulness or whatever
[11:50:57] <bookworm> and I do want my provider to have redundancies / backups etc
[11:51:34] <fnutt> I feel like there's a bigger chance Google will keep it free for many years to come than Oracle. But I might just as well be wrong.
[11:51:49] <fnutt> Especially considering the amount of resources Oracle gives away.
[11:51:55] <bookworm> but if you are resource constraint, go for it... just make sure you have offsite backups or even better use a thing like chef / puppet / terraform or what have you to configure it and back up the data
[12:25:25] <fnutt> I wouldn't mind a bit more guts on the vps. ;p
[12:25:50] <fnutt> I did however find something very useful yesterday! https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/3659
[12:26:19] <fnutt> I commented out "Use xz compression per GCE" in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/99-gce.conf
[12:26:28] <fnutt> It's a big difference. :D
[12:27:08] <fnutt> It seemed like "xz: Adjusted LZMA2 dictionary size from 8 MiB to 2 MiB to not exceed the memory usage limit of 30 MiB" was a real bottleneck.
