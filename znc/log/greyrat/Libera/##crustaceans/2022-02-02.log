[00:23:37] <imode> I had an internal crisis this morning about why a SHA256 computation wasn't deterministic.
[00:23:56] <imode> and then I resolved it myself. why do people get hung on shit without trying.
[00:24:05] <imode> if I have to suffer so do you.

[00:25:58] <buttsbot> Deep Impact (spacecraft) - Wikipedia
[00:27:51] <manicennui> Trying is hard.
[00:28:23] <manicennui> I've never understood what these people think they are going to do if they end up faking their way through a degree and somehow manage to get a job.
[00:28:59] <manicennui> There are certainly companies/jobs where you might not be fired for a while, but you probably aren't going to get through most interviews and most companies aren't going to deal with your incompetence for long.
[00:29:02] <imode> I faked it until I made it. but eventually I had to make it.
[00:29:30] <manicennui> I'm not sure exactly what people mean when they say that.
[00:29:43] <imode> mostly self-motivational.
[00:29:43] <manicennui> I know that I don't know everything I might need to know, but I'm confident that I can learn it.
[00:29:48] <manicennui> And in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:30:02] <imode> throw yourself into unfamiliar situations and be confident that you'll eventually know the territory.
[00:30:08] <manicennui> It's not like, "I hope I can figure it out."
[00:30:57] <manicennui> Short of a job requiring really specialized domain knowledge, like quantum physics or something, I'm very confident that I can learn whatever.
[00:31:14] <manicennui> I'm sure I could learn that too, but I might not have the discipline or time.
[00:33:04] <manicennui> I think a lot of people believe far more in "luck".
[00:34:58] <companion_cube> time is a factor though
[00:35:07] <companion_cube> I think I could learn what I need to become a video game dev
[00:35:12] <companion_cube> but it'd take *years*
[00:35:21] <manicennui> Yeah, but I wouldn't try to fake my way into a job like that.
[00:35:35] <manicennui> I assume you mean like a AAA game developer.
[00:35:56] <manicennui> I also have never felt the need to be "fake".
[00:36:16] <companion_cube> no, for sure.
[00:36:42] <manicennui> Before I got this job I had never done Ruby/Rails before. When I decided that I was going to go for a Rails job I learned Ruby and some Rails.
[00:37:20] <manicennui> I interviewed at Pivotal and it was obvious that I was not experienced with TDD and pair programming.
[00:37:31] <manicennui> Mostly because I thought it was idiotic. Now I know it is.
[00:37:39] <companion_cube> I have a very very specific set of skills, but a colleague didn't, and is slowly learning them. He's incredibly smart though.
[00:38:04] <manicennui> I kept wanting to jump ahead during the interview.
[00:38:21] <manicennui> But the guy wanted me to act dumb and "do the simplest thing that makes the test pass".
[00:38:26] <companion_cube> :D
[00:38:32] <companion_cube> pedantic TDD?
[00:38:35] <manicennui> Which is dumb shit like hard coding value.
[00:39:02] <manicennui> s
[00:39:51] <manicennui> The example was also dumb because we were writing a class for some basic data structure that already exists in Ruby.
[00:39:58] <manicennui> And you'd never reimplement it poorly.
[00:40:32] <companion_cube> what is the point of writing code that will obviously not be useful (like hardcoding a value)??
[00:40:55] <manicennui> companion_cube: I can't answer that.
[00:41:06] <manicennui> The next step is to add another example to your tests which causes it to fail.
[00:41:14] <manicennui> Then you triangulate and write real code.
[00:41:18] <companion_cube> take my haaaand
[00:41:28] <companion_cube> and follow blindlyyyyy
[00:42:06] <manicennui> I think it's more about following the process of writing a test, see it fail, make it pass.
[00:43:28] <manicennui> I think TDD is bad as a design process unless you are writing the most trivial of code (code that probably already exists in some library so you don't actually have to design it or dumb shit like "add another field to this object"), and the pedantic way of doing it is slow.
[00:43:40] <manicennui> the only benefit, arguably, is that you have tests.
[00:44:08] <manicennui> But I'd argue that half the tests that people write to hit 100% coverage are basically testing the framework/library.
[00:44:54] <manicennui> Fortunately almost no one at this place does real TDD.
[00:45:00] <manicennui> Or even fake TDD.
[00:45:36] <manicennui> There are people who are pushing for 100% coverage.
[00:47:07] <companion_cube> I kind of do some TDD, but directly with some integration tests
[00:47:12] <companion_cube> I mean, the red-green thing
[00:47:46] * manicennui introduces a new orange blue technique.
[00:56:26] <manicennui> Fortunately we are planning to focus more on contract testing.
[00:57:20] <manicennui> I will never get tired of watching videos of people bringing home new kitties.
[00:59:41] <companion_cube> aren't the kitties afraid? :s
[00:59:48] <manicennui> Sometimes.
[00:59:55] <manicennui> But usually they are super curious.
[00:59:56] *** Joins: jj5 (~jj5@211-26-131-173.dyn.dodo.net.au)
[01:00:02] <manicennui> And then they become more comfortable.
[01:03:49] <manicennui> Performance review discussion schedule for next Friday. Finally.
[01:04:12] <companion_cube> "you need to take 300ms less on your average task"
[01:04:17] <companion_cube> perf record manicennui
[01:04:26] <manicennui> I don't know that it matters at this point. The only real reason to stay at this place longer is to have a stable job when I move.
[01:04:50] <manicennui> companion_cube: Fortunately the reviews here are never a surprise, and they are rarely very critical.
[01:05:24] <manicennui> The practice of springing crap on people at review time is frowned upon here.
[01:15:33] <Church> Well that's something
[01:15:40] <Church> I'm waiting to hear back on a promotion
[01:15:50] <Church> myself.*
[01:15:52] <manicennui> I don't want to be promoted anymore.
[01:15:55] <manicennui> I just want more money.
[01:16:01] <manicennui> But I also don't want to do Rails anymore.
[01:16:08] <Church> Heh fair enough, I'm hoping there comes more money
[01:16:30] <Church> It's as part of a move to the wider SRE team in the org instead of just working for my division.
[01:16:43] <manicennui> I was told that I'm supposed to receive a more substantial raise this year.
[01:16:56] <manicennui> Which I doubt somewhat, and ultimately probably won't matter.
[01:17:04] <Church> Under the division I'm an Engineer II, as part of the wider org I'm an Assistant Software Engineer. So manager is trying to boost my on paper credibility I think
[01:17:19] <manicennui> That's an odd title.
[01:17:26] <Church> The latter?
[01:17:28] <Church> Yeah a bit
[01:17:29] <manicennui> Yes.
[01:17:58] <Church> They do Assistant -> Software -> Senior Software -> Staff Engineer/Lead/what the fuck ever title
[01:18:02] <Church> Usually
[01:18:42] <manicennui> So Assistant is like their Junior?
[01:18:59] <Church> Guess so ya
[01:19:56] <Church> Took a downgrade in title when we got acquired
[01:20:12] <Church> Which I found funny as that was like a month after getting promoted heh
[01:24:09] <manicennui> I hate when companies fuck around with that sort of thing.
[01:24:48] <manicennui> I got promoted once and then they didn't give me the annual raise because they said I had already received a raise that year.
[01:24:58] <manicennui> And the promotion raise was not substantial.
[01:25:22] <manicennui> So basically I had more responsibilities and was paid what I probably would have made if I weren't promoted.
[01:25:32] <manicennui> My current employer doesn't do that though.
[01:25:45] <manicennui> I've received a promotion with raise and the year end raise in the same year twice.
[01:32:29] <manicennui> This Scottish Fold kittie was scared, then curious, then more comfortable, and then sleepy.
[01:32:40] <manicennui> Being a kittie is hard work.

[02:53:19] <manicennui> I'm wondering whether demand is super high for grocery delivery, or there aren't enough people willing to do it.
[02:53:26] <manicennui> Amazon never has any availability for Whole Foods.
[02:54:40] <manicennui> Instacart had a lot of availability, and Target seemed to have availability (they don't carry a lot of good stuff though).
[02:55:33] <bkero> Online grocery delivery is the future.
[02:55:45] <companion_cube> it's a shitty job, isn't it?
[03:02:55] <manicennui> What's shitty about it?
[03:03:03] <manicennui> I mean, it's not highly desirable or anything.
[03:04:48] <companion_cube> it's probably highly time sensitive and your boss is an algorithm
[03:04:52] <companion_cube> given how amazon operates
[03:06:12] <bkero> Not good for humans
[03:07:10] <imode> I pay a minimum of 20% for grocery deliveries because it's a shit job.
[03:07:14] <imode> 20% tip that is.
[03:07:36] <bkero> At least they earn some more money as they're abused.
[03:08:17] <manicennui> companion_cube: Do you mean in general or Amazon specifically?
[03:08:28] <manicennui> I paid 20% tip.
[03:08:56] <imode> I try to at least help them out with heavy orders.
[03:09:17] <imode> so I'm at least lugging my own groceries.
[03:11:20] <manicennui> imode: For whatever reason the groceries part of Amazon's site is the worst part of the site that I have ever used.
[03:11:22] <manicennui> I blame you.
[03:11:30] <bkero> I'm sure your 20% is more than sufficient to counteract https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-workforce-safety-60-minutes-2020-05-10/
[03:11:31] <buttsbot> -             Examining Amazon's treatment of its workers - 60 Minutes - CBS News -
[03:11:42] <manicennui> It is slow as fuck and you have to click through 40 screens to checkout.
[03:12:08] <imode> oh I don't fucking use amazon's bullshit, I use instacart.
[03:12:21] <imode> feel free to channel your blame through me though.
[03:13:05] <manicennui> I really only use Amazon for groceries because of Whole Foods.
[03:13:17] <manicennui> Trader Joe's could make a killing if they did delivery.
[03:15:04] <manicennui> It's too bad that Target's groceries are a bit low quality. Their delivery service seems decent.

[03:15:55] <companion_cube> manicennui: amazon specifically, from what I've always heard about their warehouses
[03:15:56] <buttsbot> This beautiful creature is a wooly monkey, and there only about 1000 of them : interestingasfuck
[03:15:57] <manicennui> Looks CGI
[03:16:01] <companion_cube> could be that whole foods is still different
[03:16:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: It's like Apple. People love to complain about the big companies. Warehouse jobs suck in general.
[03:16:41] <manicennui> Not excusing their behavior, but most warehouses are just as bad.
[03:16:58] <companion_cube> if you count apple's hardware subcontractors, then yes.
[03:16:58] <manicennui> I have some crazy stories from working at a pet supply distributor.
[03:17:41] <manicennui> companion_cube: I mean all of the complaints about conditions at Foxconn.
[03:17:50] <manicennui> All electronics assembly takes place at places like that.

[03:43:00] <buttsbot> NYC wage transparency law to go into effect in May 2022 | Employment Law Watch
[03:43:02] <manicennui> Oh shit!
[03:43:19] <manicennui> As we previously reported, the New York City Council passed legislation in December 2021 requiring New York City employers to include a maximum and minimum salary in all job postings (for new jobs as well as internal promotions and transfer opportunities).
[03:47:27] <manicennui> So who all has these laws now? I know about CO and NYC
[03:47:46] <imode> damn!
[03:47:54] <imode> that'd be useful as hell.
[03:48:19] <manicennui> Seems like a few states have something similar but less onerous.
[03:48:30] <manicennui> "California’s Equal Pay Act prohibits employers from requesting applicants’ salary history and requires that companies provide a salary range to applicants upon request."
[03:49:04] <manicennui> Washington looks similar.

[05:39:48] <manicennui> There are no bubbles or anything.
[05:41:06] <gwozniak> Yup
[05:41:22] <gwozniak> I noticed that when I watched it over the holidays
[05:41:45] <imode> frost his balls
[05:42:14] <gwozniak> And the kids aren't little, either
[05:42:21] <manicennui> Yeah.
[05:42:27] <manicennui> I think his one daughter is supposed to be a teen.
[05:42:37] <manicennui> Played by a twenty-something actress no doubt.
[05:42:45] <gwozniak> Like, a senior in high school, I think
[05:44:38] <gwozniak> As weird as that is, I maintain the music over the end credits is the worst part of the movie
[05:45:15] <gwozniak> And Eric Clapton's music did not age well
[05:53:31] <gwozniak> note: the song at the end is by Honeymoon Suite
[05:55:21] <manicennui> I forgot that Gary Busey is in this.
[06:15:41] <manicennui> His daughter also wants to bone Mel Gibson.
[06:15:52] <manicennui> Those zany 80s!

[06:44:48] <manicennui> Is Lethal Weapon 2 the one with the toilet scene?
[06:49:27] <gwozniak> Yeah
[06:50:32] <manicennui> Mel Gibson's trying to act crazy is a bit awkward early in this movie, but by the end you believe that the main characters care about each other.
[06:50:38] <manicennui> And you care about them.
[06:51:23] <gwozniak> Aside from the music, I still enjoyed the movie, despite some of it being dated
[06:52:11] <manicennui> What was the last good buddy cop movie?
[06:54:27] <gwozniak> I liked The Nice Guys, which kind of went under the radar
[06:54:49] <manicennui> The Other Guys?
[06:55:00] <manicennui> Oh, no.
[06:55:11] <gwozniak> Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling
[06:55:16] <manicennui> Yeah.
[06:55:22] <manicennui> I wanted to watch that.
[06:55:32] <companion_cube> Xe: lol
[06:55:43] <companion_cube> rewriting blockchains in Go will fix everything
[06:56:02] <gwozniak> clearly that's the problem
[06:56:21] <companion_cube> also remember that pancakeswap is super important
[06:56:23] <companion_cube> (!???!?)
[06:56:32] <manicennui> I forgot that this movie has a torture porn scene.
[06:57:22] <gwozniak> Yeah, but it's pretty tame by today's standards
[06:57:54] <companion_cube> I want to be paid in vintage NFTs (only pre-2010 millesimes)
[06:58:16] <gwozniak> manicennui: but it has Al Leong in it!

[06:58:55] <manicennui> I need to watch that again.
[06:58:58] <gwozniak> That too
[06:59:17] <gwozniak> Very influential movies to younger me
[07:00:39] <imode> "vintage NFTs"
[07:01:20] <manicennui> He was Genghis Khan in Bill & Ted's.
[07:02:10] <manicennui> Gary Busey is too serious in this.
[07:02:27] <manicennui> He doesn't seem nuts at all.
[07:02:44] <manicennui> I guess he does let that guy burn him early on.
[07:09:00] <manicennui> I love how he has a gunshot wound and they are all worn out and the other cop just lets them take his car to go chase Gary Busey.
[07:10:03] <manicennui> Oh shit.
[07:10:07] <manicennui> I forgot about the fight on his front lawn.
[07:11:49] <manicennui> Fire hydrant spraying water, helicopter light from overhead.
[07:12:10] <manicennui> What a great and ridiculous scene.
[07:12:24] <gwozniak> It is indeed both of those things
[07:13:04] <companion_cube> imode: yeah, they're also called MTG cards
[07:13:09] <companion_cube> but get on with the times
[07:15:22] <gwozniak> So that sci-fi book I'm reading basically has a scene where the "good girl" could, arguably, be said to have raped Alan Turing
[07:15:33] <companion_cube> how lovely
[07:15:59] <gwozniak> But they were decoding the Mayan codex and she got all hot about it, so, you know...
[07:16:35] <gwozniak> This is not something I would normally read, but I'm going to read it to see how ridiculous it gets
[07:16:47] <gwozniak> Because it's already pretty nuts
[07:18:44] <imode> that sounds insane.
[07:20:30] *** Joins: art_vandelay (~art_vande@142.126.234.156)
[07:21:00] <gwozniak> It's not written as a rape scene, but the way it plays out, it could be interpreted that way

[19:35:54] <prussian> honestly, the privacy policy is pretty accurate.
[19:36:25] <prussian> you can't guarantee anything you basically throw at the internet won't be kept private.
[19:36:29] <imode> why would I expect privacy on a public forum.
[19:37:00] <imode> I can only rely on lobste.rs being an open codebase to see if my passwords are being hashed.
[19:37:22] <imode> that's about the only thing I'd want kept private.
[19:37:25] <prussian> assuming source code is a one to one mapping of prod ;)
[19:37:46] <imode> yeah, hence the "I can only" bit.
[19:37:52] <prussian> i honestly stopped caring about password hashing since I started generating long junk pw for everything.

[21:33:59] <gwozniak> Currently raining here, but that is set to change in a couple of hours
[21:39:16] <prussian> damn.
[21:40:01] <prussian> all I know is fuck Punxsutawney Pill and his prognostication of 6 more weeks winter.
[21:40:15] <manicennui> Fuck winter.
[21:41:09] <manicennui> Sweet. Starbucks shareholders voted last year not to give the CEO a raise, but it was non-binding, and the board went ahead and gave it to him anyways.
[21:41:17] <companion_cube> :D
[21:41:23] <prussian> true heroes
[21:41:30] <companion_cube> he deserved it
[21:41:33] <prussian> they knew how you really wanted to vote.
[21:41:43] <companion_cube> I imagine he pourred a few millions cups of coffee, right?
[21:41:45] <companion_cube> right??
[21:42:14] <prussian> uh... ya that.
[21:42:16] <manicennui> companion_cube: Obviously he didn't do any of the low level work, but what did he do to increase their profits?
[21:42:18] <prussian> totally
[21:42:27] <manicennui> Starbucks is doing well, but how much of that is his doing?
[21:42:38] <prussian> it's probably just some generic "competitive compensation" for CEO or some bullshit
[21:43:29] <manicennui> Starbucks also raised prices.
[21:43:39] <manicennui> Brilliant!
[21:44:18] <companion_cube> "your coffee is now 10¢ more expensive so our CEO can buy his fifth yacht"
[21:44:50] <prussian> absolute unit
[21:45:04] <prussian> I hear they make submarine yachts now
[21:45:22] <prussian> or at least, well, someone designed one and no one wants one or trusts the shipbuilder to deliver.
[21:45:26] <manicennui> Space yachts are where it's at.
[21:45:59] <manicennui> It's hard to think about the amount of money that these people make.
[21:46:01] <prussian> true...
[21:46:11] <prussian> i wonder what I'd do with a yacht
[21:46:25] <gwozniak> I know I wouldn't want one
[21:46:29] <prussian> i struggle to comprehend the value of it.
[21:46:48] <manicennui> Like he makes more in one year than I'll make in my entire career.
[21:46:49] <prussian> like, outside of giving shipbuilders jobs.
[21:46:53] <prussian> "trickle down"
[21:46:55] <manicennui> And I make really good money.
[21:46:57] <prussian> or so they claim
[21:47:06] <prussian> true
[21:47:30] <prussian> for the cost of basically being the #1 target of virtually anything that can be blamed on starbs
[21:47:32] <prussian> in fairness.
[21:47:57] <manicennui> They never face any real consequences.
[21:48:08] <manicennui> Even when the company doesn't do well they get bonuses.
[21:48:18] <prussian> well.
[21:48:19] <prussian> ya
[21:48:30] <prussian> honestly, I think it takes a real special person to be CEO
[21:48:31] <manicennui> Worst case scenario is he is pushed out and gets a huge severance that is also more than I'll make in my lifetime.
[21:48:44] <manicennui> prussian: No doubt, but the question is *how* special?
[21:48:45] <prussian> it's almost like some weird level of double speak, inhumanity and plastic PR
[21:48:47] <prussian> to be it
[21:48:55] <companion_cube> manicennui: these people make so much money that they could build *hospitals*, plural
[21:49:02] <prussian> it's like a whole level of not human.
[21:49:29] <prussian> build, sure, not sure about running them
[21:49:31] <manicennui> I'm willing to be the Starbucks CEO for a quarter of what he makes.
[21:49:34] <prussian> hmm
[21:49:36] <manicennui> All I need is one year in the job.
[21:49:39] <prussian> how are CEOs even compensated?
[21:49:40] <manicennui> Then I can be fired.
[21:49:53] <manicennui> prussian: Mix of stock, cash, options...
[21:50:06] <manicennui> Often weird things like loans.
[21:50:16] <manicennui> Pretty sure Musk has some huge loans from his companies.
[21:50:23] <prussian> I have to imagine there has to be *something* keeping them where they are for as long as CEOs usually stay CEO, or move to be CEO somewhere else.
[21:50:39] <prussian> such a weird thing
[21:50:44] <manicennui> As long as the stock price keeps going up, I don't think anyone really cares.
[21:50:55] <prussian> but were they a small loan of a million dollars?
[21:51:01] <manicennui> And they probably build a lot of relationships that are super valuable.
[21:51:24] <kline> 18:11 <manicennui> Sweet. Starbucks shareholders voted last year not to give the CEO a raise, but it was non-binding, and the board went ahead and gave it to him anyways.
[21:51:25] <prussian> also holy shit FUCK laptop stickers. this god damn windows one left this big fat smear on the bottom base.

[21:52:34] <kline> if its good there, i find that worked to get the sticker goo off my thinkpad
[21:52:36] <prussian> kline: ya, I was gonna. just haven't given enough ass to get it
[21:53:00] <prussian> i have to get the rubbing alcohol out anyhow.
[21:53:10] <prussian> manicennui: ugh
[21:53:11] <prussian> why
[21:53:21] <manicennui> INTEL INSIDE
[21:53:27] <prussian> my work laptop doesn't even run windows, why would I want a WINDOWS 11 sticker?
[21:53:53] <manicennui> Because you want to feel cool.
[21:54:01] <manicennui> Even though you aren't, because you run Linux.
[21:54:48] <manicennui> Our observability team is going to upgrade the OS on our graphite nodes during the middle of the day, potentially dropping metrics for hours...
[21:54:55] <manicennui> WTF

[22:11:39] <prussian> I'm guessing to your ops people
[22:11:44] <prussian> obs people
[22:12:15] <manicennui> Not sure how a staging machine helps production.
[22:12:25] <manicennui> Didn't know if it was directed at riv.
[22:12:30] <manicennui> Doesn't seem related.
[22:12:31] <prussian> oh.
[22:12:35] <prussian> ya idk
[22:12:45] <prussian> dangerous toy that seems... mildly uh.
[22:12:47] <prussian> interesting

[22:14:28] <imode> yeah because nobody can comment on why firefox is going down the shitter.
[22:14:30] <imode> good argument, my guy.
[22:15:04] <kline> firefox is like wikipedia, has a serious case of MBA cancer
[22:15:32] <prussian> what did firefucks do now?
[22:15:57] <imode> the retrospective story on the lobste.rs front page.
[22:16:17] <kline> theres an entrenched management class in existence that will increasingly manage the company as a spreadsheet optimisation problem and try to flex all the management quick tips like partnerships and acquisitions, because "make the core product better" doesnt justify swelling their ranks and paychecks
[22:16:48] <manicennui> There was a HN submission about this...
[22:16:51] <prussian> oh
[22:16:54] <Brekkjern> Making the core product better takes effort.
[22:17:22] <prussian> how do we save firefucks then?
[22:17:38] <imode> someone from mozilla security chimed in that "Firefox needs to talk to a variety of services to function."
[22:17:49] <imode> yes. those variety of services are the websites I visit.
[22:17:50] <prussian> I still use firefox honestly.
[22:17:53] <imode> so do I.
[22:18:01] <kline> fire 80% of the management and C suite, invest the money back into developer hiring, and make firefox a better browser than chrome
[22:18:07] <prussian> 13:47 < imode> yes. those variety of services are the websites I visit.
[22:18:09] <prussian> w-wut

[22:18:46] <manicennui> I don't think it is especially well written, but it is along those lines.
[22:18:55] <kline> yes, it was
[22:18:57] <prussian> wait what happened in jan 13th?
[22:19:03] <prussian> was that the http/3 bug?
[22:19:10] <companion_cube> fuck http3
[22:19:12] <companion_cube> oops
[22:19:15] <prussian> ugh i'll just read the whole fucking post lol
[22:19:18] <imode> lmao.
[22:19:44] <manicennui> "With skills of misdirection worthy of a practiced magician, digital businesses urge us to focus on the quantitative data delivered by online analytics systems while ignoring cues from the offline world because they don’t come in the form of a cute, concise, glowing dashboard. All too often, the data-driven approach puts consumers and corporations alike in the position of General McNamara, discovering only when it’s too
[22:19:44] <manicennui> late that obsession with measurement makes management impossible"
[22:26:02] <gwozniak> I totally agree with that
[22:26:11] <gwozniak> The obession with metrics kills so many things
[22:27:28] <manicennui> This page tries to blame a lot of the problems in Vietnam on McNamara's obsession with metrics.
[22:27:35] <manicennui> Specifically that more enemies were dying than Americans.
[22:27:47] <manicennui> I don't know the history well enough to have an opinion.
[22:29:17] <manicennui> I agree with the overall sentiment, but the page goes off into nonsense about social media likes.
[22:35:22] <prussian> imode: man, really? more case confusion with http headers?
[22:35:26] <prussian> uugggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[22:40:16] <manicennui> I either can't fall asleep until 1 or 2, or I fall asleep before midnight and then wake up at like 3 or 4.

[23:27:07] <gerikson> Brekkjern: it's just one of the tics I dislike about HN
[23:27:16] <gerikson> that, and random wiki submissions

[23:27:31] <gerikson> I don't know what's wrong with plain ol' Computer Modern (as TeX uses by default).''
[23:28:06] <Brekkjern> I don't see the value of random wiki submissions, but large outages seem to be interesting from a practical point of view if not from a professional point of view.
[23:28:56] <manicennui> I think it's sad that so many adults are obsessed with HP.
[23:29:47] <imode> obsession is a strong word.
[23:29:55] <manicennui> Not for a lot of people I see.
[23:30:21] <imode> really? how deep does the obsession go.
[23:30:56] <manicennui> Similar to the level displayed by a lot of Star Wars and MCU fans.
[23:31:37] <manicennui> Just talking about it all the time, buying merchandise, acting as though it is some kind of peak of human creativity.
[23:31:45] <manicennui> Doesn't help that the author starts shit all the time.
[23:46:26] <riv> hp is ok but the author is a nasty piece of work
[23:51:04] <gerikson> I prefer Dell
[23:51:06] <gerikson> oh waut
