[00:28:02] <Brekkjern> Started to watch Loki and it's rather fun
[00:33:30] <ngoldbaum> episode 4 and 5 are great
[00:33:45] <Brekkjern> I got to episode 3
[00:38:51] <gwozniak> I heard good things, too
[00:39:04] <Xe> loki is a good show
[00:39:19] <gwozniak> I have so much other stuff I want to watch, though, and I don't want to get Disney+
[00:39:25] <Xe> it really deconstructs a lot of tropes involved with the concept of villains
[00:39:36] <Xe> gwozniak: i checked it out from the swedish library
[00:39:37] <companion_cube> so apparently the pixel 4a is buyable
[00:39:41] <companion_cube> so I'm going to just do that
[00:39:49] <companion_cube> not too expensive, should have good OS upgrades…
[00:39:56] <dasm> Xe: have you been sailing recently? :)
[00:40:01] <gwozniak> Xe: may consider something similiar, then

[01:21:37] <Brekkjern> >Unix is of course data-centric, while proprietary OSes like Windows and iOS are very code-centric.
[01:21:37] <Brekkjern> What the fuck does this even mean?
[01:21:57] <Brekkjern> I feel like I need to snort some real designer crack to understand what some people mean on the site
[01:22:17] <Brekkjern> Either that, or it's the smoke that comes from the blown capacitors of the ancient crap of a computer they use
[01:22:51] <riv> lol
[01:25:03] <kline> heres something that bothers me every time i see it or something like it:
[01:25:04] <kline>     WARNING: Code licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) MUST NOT be used at Google. The license places restrictions on software used over a network which are extremely difficult for Google to comply with.
[01:25:04] <kline> This seems like a resounding success of AGPL.
[01:25:15] <kline> end quote
[01:25:34] <riv> google bad
[01:25:47] <kline> i think it a resounding failure of the AGPL that it has essentially move good, free software _out of the scope_ of users
[01:26:18] <cb> better stance is, people can make a gorillion dollars from agpl sw as long as people got their freedoms
[01:26:24] <kline> writing free software and celebrating that it cant be used might be a personal victory for people who dont like commercial software, but its a negative for users, who now will not benefit from it
[01:26:37] <kline> and its a net negative for free software, who lose a position to influence from
[01:26:47] <companion_cube> sounds like the same kind of argument people say about GPL
[01:26:50] <companion_cube> not just AGPL
[01:26:54] <companion_cube> "what if bigcorp uses your code"
[01:26:54] <riv> well it goes back to the tivoization issue
[01:27:03] <kline> yes, ive used "free software" here, because its not, imo, AGPL specific
[01:27:04] <cb> kline: one of my Theories(tm) is that the FSF massively overplayed their hand with GPLv3 and lost hard
[01:27:27] <cb> while businesses tohught v2 was mostly fine, with the exception of IBM everyone backed the fuck off from anything GPLv3
[01:27:29] <kline> any case where, in the end, users and foss influence loses counts as a loss
[01:27:35] <cb> not just businesses, but influential people like linus
[01:27:59] <kline> yeah
[01:28:45] <kline> too many people i think have lost sight of what free software is about
[01:28:49] <cb> i mean ive heard the agpl is so nebuously defined it's risky even normal people
[01:29:10] <ngoldbaum> back in 2005 you could argue that the fsf’s primary purpose wasn’t to support richard stallman personally
[01:29:15] <ngoldbaum> in 2021 not so much
[01:29:19] <ngoldbaum> kinda just gone downhill
[01:29:22] <cb> ngoldbaum: that's what it became when they lost every front
[01:29:29] <cb> would LLVM and the rise of liberal licenses happened witohut GPLv3?
[01:29:38] <cb> possibly but it would have been slower
[01:29:52] <kline> if i write free software and google uses it, thats a massive win, it means users are benefitting from free software, and can leverage that to control their own destiny by working on the stuff their services use
[01:30:17] <cb> well, not if it's locked behind a network
[01:30:17] <kline> found a bug in a google service thats actively causing you an issue? realise its from an upstream foss library? fix it there, jobs a goodun
[01:30:28] <cb> free software/oss has mostly been great for people building gilded cages
[01:30:35] <ngoldbaum> what if you write free software and amazon offers it in a managed config with closed source secret sauce on top
[01:30:41] <cb> it's not like you'll ever see or know libhober is powering an aws service
[01:30:47] <kline> ngoldbaum, for any purpose
[01:30:48] <cb> or that it benefits you, freedoms wise

[01:30:54] <buttsbot> Twitter - vebaccount - Economists Have Yet To Answer Why, If The Vaccine Is Free, Every Individual Is Not Consuming Infinite Vaccines
[01:30:56] <Brekkjern> OSS gave us stuff like Kubernetes and other tools like that. If not for them, everyone would be running on Hyper-V or some shit
[01:30:59] <cb> it's greta for people like me who need to get in and hack and need to know source to do so
[01:31:09] <riv> hahaha
[01:31:11] <cb> but useless for the average computer user
[01:31:36] <kline> ngoldbaum, im perfectly ok with amazon offering free software with non-free additions
[01:31:55] <cb> sure, tho i wonder how sustainable that really is
[01:32:07] <cb> anyways, now the FSF can't market and can barely develop SW
[01:32:09] <ngoldbaum> ask elasticsearch or whoever
[01:32:14] <kline> if nothing else, its amazon do free demand signalling for the foss project on what they could consider implementing next to put amazon out of business
[01:35:45] <kline> if the entire world was proprietary services made solely by plumbing together foss libraries in different ways, id be a very happy man
[01:36:07] <Xe> kline: the main problem is that if Google bases a product by reselling a memedb, they usually don't go back and turn a percentage of revenue into income for that project
[01:36:38] <Xe> and usually Google has to fit a square peg into a spanner round hole
[01:36:57] <kline> Xe, im not sure it makes a difference if google uses memedb and contribute back $0 or if google doesnt use memedb and contributes back $0
[01:37:40] <kline> the advantage with the first one is that users and developers have a fighting chance at doing their on projects/on prem versions rather than being totally and irredeemably locked in
[01:38:33] <kline> free software is about software freedom, for users firstly and then developers after that. that you can or should be able to turn a profit on it is a business issue related to it but not the purpose of free software
[01:39:12] <Brekkjern> If Free Software was for developer freedom, we wouldn't have licenses.
[01:39:46] <kline> yeah, developer freedom is a distant, far distant, second place to user freedom
[01:40:16] <kline> but imo there is overlap in what it means to be a user between end user and developer, especially if its something you speak to over the network rather than directly integrate at the source level
[01:42:10] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but as long as the value of the service is stored on the server side, what license the software has is absolutely irrelevant to me
[01:44:34] <kline> is disagree. take amazon running mongodb
[01:44:43] <kline> they might provide you with none of the special sauce
[01:45:09] <Brekkjern> But the service they are giving me is running the DB for me so I don't have to.
[01:45:24] <kline> but because its mongodb, the barrier to you implementing your own competitor, or as a user, finding such a competitor, is much lower than if it were entirely proprietary
[01:45:28] <Brekkjern> I could run it myself, but then I'm not actually consuming any service at all from Amazon
[01:45:44] <kline> in addition, you can drive some changes in what amazon provides by working on the upstream yourself
[01:46:01] <kline> it gives you a voice you wouldnt have if it were purely amazon proprietary code
[01:46:30] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but I'd quote cb from earlier today here
[01:46:38] <kline> Brekkjern, the option to run it yourself, and the option to find someone else to pay instead of amazon both have value, even if (right now) you want it as saas from aws

[14:11:56] <goodger[m]> whomst
[14:34:12] <Brekkjern> goodger[m]: It was a comment regarding this: https://lobste.rs/s/mjo19d/unix_microservice_platforms#c_q8t14f
[14:34:14] <buttsbot> Unix and Microservice Platforms | Lobsters
[14:41:55] <goodger[m]> what's wrong with that?
[14:42:20] <gerikson> man @duncan_bayne still referencing the Halloween documents, which are old enough to drink in most US states
[14:42:23] <Brekkjern> It's nonsense. Nothing he's said means anything at all.
[14:43:26] <goodger[m]> I found it pretty easy to understand
[14:45:42] <Brekkjern> You'll have to forgive me for not understanding what he means by "Unix is simpler to understand" when you literally have to read documentation to understand the /etc/passwd format, while in PowerShell it's just a Get-LocalUsers call away and the structure of the data is immediately obvious
[14:46:56] <Geekingfrog> Do you need to know some .net when wrangling powershell?
[14:47:21] <Brekkjern> Geekingfrog: No. You can import .NET and compile directly in the shell, but you don't need to know squat about it to use the shell.
[14:47:36] <Geekingfrog> Never touched it, but I have to admit having structured data flowing through commands is quite nice, I mainly wonder how verbose/efficient it is to use that.
[14:48:21] <Brekkjern> The verbosity is not a problem IMO. Commands have longer names than typical linux tools, but with tab completion it's not really a problem
[14:48:54] <Brekkjern> Especially since all commands follow a pretty logical structure of Verb-Noun, and the verbs are from an "approved" list
[14:50:45] <Geekingfrog> Do you have a typical small powershill script I can look at, to get some idea.
[14:51:33] <Brekkjern> Not really. It's so easy to create something on the fly that I don't keep snippets around. I just make a function for things that are somewhat complex.
[14:53:34] <Brekkjern> But the structure of most powershell oneliners to modify a setting something like this:
[14:53:34] <Brekkjern> Get-Something -(somefilter) | % {$_.SomeProperty = "someValue") | Set-Something
[14:55:32] <goodger[m]> with such clear and intuitive syntax it's a wonder we're not all using it
[14:56:06] <Brekkjern> As an example, this grabs all the "approved" verbs, selects just the name of the verb as a string, and concats them as a string with commas between them:
[14:56:06] <Brekkjern> (Get-Verb | Select -Exp Verb) -Join ", "
[14:57:16] <Brekkjern> Could probably write it shorter, or more clearly by writing -Exp as -ExpandProperty, but eh
[14:58:15] <goodger[m]> does it have anything other than getter/setter boilerplate?
[14:58:24] <Brekkjern> Do you mean the verbs?
[14:58:53] <Brekkjern> These are all the registered verbs on my machine:
[14:58:54] <Brekkjern> Add, Clear, Close, Copy, Enter, Exit, Find, Format, Get, Hide, Join, Lock, Move, New, Open, Optimize, Pop, Push, Redo, Remove, Rename, Reset, Resize, Search, Select, Set, Show, Skip, Split, Step, Switch, Undo, Unlock, Watch, Backup, Checkpoint, Compare, Compress, Convert, ConvertFrom, ConvertTo, Dismount, Edit, Expand, Export, Group, Import, Initialize, Limit, Merge, Mount, Out, Publish, Restore, Save, Sync, Unpublish, Update, Approve, Assert,
[14:58:54] <Brekkjern> Complete, Confirm, Deny, Disable, Enable, Install, Invoke, Register, Request, Restart, Resume, Start, Stop, Submit, Suspend, Uninstall, Unregister, Wait, Debug, Measure, Ping, Repair, Resolve, Test, Trace, Connect, Disconnect, Read, Receive, Send, Write, Block, Grant, Protect, Revoke, Unblock, Unprotect, Use
[14:59:39] <Brekkjern> I just added "| Set-Clipboard" to the previous command for that
[14:59:39] <Geekingfrog> how do you plug additional stuff on that? For example, the "someValue" set to a generated uuid, or the current datetime in a specific format.
[14:59:54] <Brekkjern> Get-Datetime -Format <formatstring>
[15:00:01] <Brekkjern> Or is it Get-Date?
[15:00:07] <Brekkjern> Can't remember. I always autocomplete it anyways
[15:00:13] <Geekingfrog> so $_.SomeProperty = Get-Datetime ?
[15:00:24] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but in parentesis
[15:00:30] <Geekingfrog> ok, similar to $() then
[15:00:31] <Brekkjern> (Get-Date)
[15:00:33] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:00:44] <Brekkjern> Using a $() is for running commands inside strings
[15:01:13] <Brekkjern> And I think that is done by "${SomeCommand}", but I can't quite remember. Been a while :P
[15:01:51] <Brekkjern> There's also actual types instead of treating everything as strings
[15:02:06] <Brekkjern> So you can have ints of various sizes, strings, arrays, hashtables, etc
[15:02:55] <Brekkjern> Usually you don't have to think about that as PowerShell does the heavy lifting there, but it's nice if you want to force something
[15:05:36] <Brekkjern> Also, the man pages are excellent
[15:06:06] <gerikson> there's also an "integrated script environment" like a mini Visual Studio with auto-complete, built-in help, etc
[15:06:10] <gerikson> also debugging ofc
[15:06:34] <Brekkjern> Well, ISE is deprecated I think, but the VS Code plugin is fantastic
[15:07:03] <gerikson> huh TIL
[15:07:29] <Brekkjern> I think it will be shipped with Windows until they completely migrate to PowerShell Core
[15:07:34] <gerikson> I mostly dick around on older servers
[15:07:40] <Brekkjern> But don't quote me on any of this :P
[15:07:44] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:08:02] <Brekkjern> It's probably going to be around for a while knowing Microsoft and backwards compatability :P
[15:08:54] <Brekkjern> But as an example of how the man pages are: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-date?view=powershell-7.1
[15:08:54] <buttsbot> Get-Date (Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility) - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs
[15:09:06] <Brekkjern> That is exactly the same as what you get in the terminal
[15:09:36] <Brekkjern> And if you want, you can specify which sub-sections you actually want to see.
[15:09:56] <gerikson> why is there 4 differnet PowerShell examples ;)
[15:10:17] <Brekkjern> gerikson: 4 different parameter sets
[15:11:10] <Brekkjern> -AsUTC isn't compatible with -UFormat for example
[15:11:17] <Brekkjern> So they are in different parameter sets
[15:11:43] <Brekkjern> And -Date and -UnixTimeSeconds <Int64>  don't make sense together
[15:12:24] <Brekkjern> It looks kinda dumb for the Get-Date cmdlet since the parameters are so similar, but some other cmdlets look rather different depending on what data you pump into them
[15:13:09] <gerikson> ah ok
[15:22:02] <gerikson> lol looks like pushcx got tired of @soc's shit
[15:22:48] <Brekkjern> Yep
[15:52:11] <goodger[m]> for a while I thought ‘soc’ was people abbreviating angersock
[15:54:15] <Brekkjern> Hehe. I did the same to begin with
[15:54:26] <Brekkjern> But they made themselves... noticed :P
[16:03:14] <goodger[m]> this thinkpad can't quite cope with running gzdoom at 960x540
[16:03:40] <goodger[m]> I feel like this indicates something's seriously wrong with the linux drivers for intel on-die GPUs
[16:33:40] <prussian> wut
[16:34:31] <prussian> goodger[m]: what iGPU and are you sure you aren't using CPU-render only OpenGL features?
[16:40:36] <goodger[m]> HD 620 and I don't know
[16:43:52] <Brekkjern> Longshot, but is there a way to add an intermediary cert to rhel so you don't trust the cert, but it's available for resolution when trying to verify a cert?
[16:43:54] <prussian> i mean... I'm pretty sure that is new enough.
[16:44:39] <prussian> goodger[m]: i'm assuming you are plugged in? because I don't get how gzdoom can be destroying that unless it's doing some really weird crap with shaders or drawing a lot of crap off screen.
[16:44:43] <goodger[m]> yeah, me too -_-
[16:44:53] <goodger[m]> yep
[16:45:42] <prussian> https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html you can try forcing compat mode.
[16:45:43] <buttsbot> Environment Variables — The Mesa 3D Graphics Library latest documentation
[16:46:06] <prussian> MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE like MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3COMPAT and see if that works.
[16:46:06] <prussian> lol
[16:47:16] <prussian> glxinfo gives you what opengl version? I'm assuming 4.6 with (Core profile) ?
[16:49:05] <goodger[m]> 4.6 core profile, 4.6 compatibility, ES 3.2
[16:52:21] <goodger[m]> Running it with MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3COMPAT causes it to crash, so there's that
[16:52:37] <prussian> ~_~
[16:52:40] <prussian> epic
[16:54:05] <prussian> my desktop doesn't have iGPU otherwise I'd try to understand myself.
[16:54:20] <prussian> I think my work laptop has a similar part but it is in the office.
[16:58:09] <Brekkjern> Blergh. This is complicated...
[16:58:17] <Brekkjern> Complicated is annoying
[16:58:21] <prussian> oh. ya your thing.. uh
[16:58:31] <prussian> I think Redhat distros do cer bundles
[16:59:04] <prussian> so I'm not really sure what to say, make a bundle of all the certs I suppose.
[16:59:36] <Brekkjern> I found some references to the bundles, but they don't really say if they then explicitly trust the intermediary or not
[16:59:45] <Brekkjern> Not that it really matters when I think about it...
[17:00:41] <prussian> assuming it's in the bundle, I imagine it is assumed a-ok
[17:03:17] <Brekkjern> Yeah

[18:12:13] <prussian> well. ama about shell if you need to.
[18:12:20] <prussian> but yes. I agree they are pretty awful
[18:13:07] <Geekingfrog> but oh so convenient
[18:30:31] <ngoldbaum> which is better: turtle or snail?
[18:30:50] <ngoldbaum> shell bracket let’s go
[18:32:23] <prussian> turtle probably
[18:38:04] <companion_cube> the french eat snails but not turtle, go figure
[18:39:18] <Brekkjern> I bet they would eat turtle if it was at all abundant :P
[18:39:46] <goodger[m]> They definitely eat turtles

[18:40:44] <buttsbot> Tasty tale of the tortoise | Books | The Guardian
[18:49:25] <goodger[m]> Ancient but tragically palatable sounds like a woman eaten by cats
[18:50:04] <prussian> yum
[18:50:39] <prussian> wonder what turtle tastes like. Gator meat is ok.
[18:52:18] <prussian> I never knew Giant Tortoise was a delicacy
[18:52:24] <companion_cube> never heard of anyone eating turtle :D
[18:53:31] <ngoldbaum> mockturtle tho
[18:53:37] <prussian> companion_cube: same. TIL

[18:59:10] <Brekkjern> Why does andyc keep commenting on Windows stuff when it's evident that he doesn't have the faintest clue on how it works there?
[19:00:06] <riv> reads like a nickp
[19:00:18] <riv> if it was just 20x longer
[19:00:25] <gwozniak> I just don't bother with andyc comments
[19:00:50] <riv> he literally just does free association typing until he manages to mention oil shell
[19:01:00] <Brekkjern> Yes
[19:01:26] <Brekkjern> I really don't understand why he hasn't gotten a talking to yet
[19:01:39] <riv> <hr> Some other notes:
[19:01:43] <riv> for some reason this construct made me laugh
[19:02:29] <companion_cube> riv: you made me laugh
[19:02:44] <companion_cube> free association typing \hline For Oil I do […]
[19:04:27] <goodger[m]> what is an andyc?
[19:04:43] <companion_cube> a lobsters user
[19:05:17] <Geekingfrog> with a mandatory <hr> in all his comments
[19:37:24] <prussian> reading the actual link: >ZyklonB IRC bot
[19:37:27] <prussian> I see....
[19:37:46] <gerikson> wtf?
[19:40:24] <prussian> lol
[19:40:24] <riv> to go with kike ircd
[19:40:33] <prussian> ya I was gonna say
[19:40:44] <prussian> these links are, interesting.
[19:41:02] <gerikson> where are these links?
[19:41:17] <prussian> in that article. https://lobste.rs/s/wprseq/on_unix_composability

[19:41:25] <buttsbot> p/uirc3: Unethical IRC client, daemon and bot -  uirc3 - git.janouch.name
[19:41:26] <prussian> also
[19:41:29] <prussian> just scroll
[19:42:03] <prussian> I guess this guy really met the goal of unethical thinking.
[19:43:17] <prussian> this guy really loves massive single source file programs.
[19:45:43] <cb> Brekkjern: imho call out the unixbrained people
[19:46:16] <ngoldbaum> what’s with the cryptofascist / unix nerd overlap
[19:46:45] <gerikson> ok had to google https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degesch
[19:46:45] <buttsbot> Degesch - Wikipedia
[19:46:49] <cb> i think it's more the fact unix is so ubiquitious it's not a useful metric on anything
[19:47:03] <cb> i.e. suckless are unix nerds because There Is No Alternative
[19:47:11] <riv> alternative hypothesis: UNIX causes peoples brians to implode
[19:47:17] <cb> riv: this is also correct
[19:47:38] <ngoldbaum> 9front also has cryptofascists i guess
[19:47:51] <ngoldbaum> rob pike is the common denominator
[19:48:45] <cb> plan 9 stuff, that's /g/
[19:49:02] <cb> though iirc 9front is less fascist more edgy
[19:49:38] <cb> i.e. the banners here are prob not something a fascist would put up http://9front.org/
[19:49:42] <buttsbot> 9FRONT.ORG THE PLAN FELL OFF
[19:49:56] <prussian> man I hate TINA
[19:50:30] <cb> now, uriel was a big p9 cheerleader and he was ancap, but i don't know how much of a fan he was of i.e. pinochet
[19:50:42] <prussian> < riv> alternative hypothesis: UNIX causes peoples brians to implode <-- this is mine.
[19:50:52] <prussian> as well
[19:51:00] <cb> bruh i fucking hate "programming is easy on linux compared to windows"
[19:51:06] <cb> have you fucks even used visual studio?????
[19:51:17] <gerikson> bro do you even gdb
[19:51:19] <cb> gdb alone should disqualify the unix programming environment
[19:51:21] <prussian> ok the 9front mock quote:  Only one remote hole in the default install, in a heck of a long time!
[19:51:24] <prussian> made me laugh
[19:51:52] <cb> i never know if gdb is buggy or my code is fucked
[19:52:09] <prussian> I remember MSVC not supporting a lot of C++11 for some time.
[19:52:09] <ngoldbaum> the answer is clearly both
[19:52:13] <prussian> that's about all I remember.
[19:52:15] <gerikson> ask the RMS 8-ball
[19:52:30] <prussian> or the toolchain needing a EULA.
[19:52:34] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: all signs point to delicious toejam
[19:52:47] <prussian> love it or hate it, but at least on linux things magically are in some respects.
[19:52:47] <companion_cube> RMS 8-ball should be a sentence in posix me harder
[19:52:47] <buttsbot> Richard was in shock. "Proprietary love! I don't believe this!" he shouted.
[19:53:08] <cb> prussian: MSVC is aggressive on C++ features but historical dgaf about C99
[19:53:10] <cb> until recently
[19:53:26] <prussian> it's been awhile. probably true.
[19:53:26] <gerikson> tbh I've never seen a magic 8-ball in the flesh
[19:53:45] <prussian> last I used it was like in 2013?
[19:53:47] <prussian> something like that.
[19:54:30] <prussian> also ya. gdb is a mess.
[19:54:51] <prussian> I think I segfaulted gdb at least 5 times trying to debug all sorts of buggy code in the last 3 weeks.
[19:58:00] <prussian> ahhh another all-hands meeting where I do nothing but post useless junk on the internet.
[20:21:23] <Brekkjern> cb: I agree, but I feel like I should probably be a bit more tactful than what I am in here while doing it...
[20:23:37] <cb> i agree
[20:23:41] <cb> prussian: wait until you run gdb on aix
[20:25:57] <prussian> I will just not use AIX. simple.
