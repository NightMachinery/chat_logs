[00:00:16] <JesseDesu> how many bitcoin do you need to buy an aircraft carrier
[00:00:47] <lastonestanding> JesseDesu: big breasted women can suck on their on boobies
[00:01:06] <emmeka> JesseDesu in BTC a "satoshi" is the base unit of the coin, I think 1 billionth of a bitcoin.
[00:01:34] <emmeka> apparently 1/100 million. whatever, I was off by an order of magnitude...

[00:15:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most computers with lower word lengths are simply used in more industrial uses where they suffice at a lower cost for adequate performance.
[00:15:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No need for a 64-bit 3Ghz processor on a sensor that's only meant to ping out a radio every minute or so.
[00:16:08] <lastonestanding> but they expire
[00:16:25] <lastonestanding> you need 64bits to go beyond 2037
[00:16:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lastonestanding: Not really. That depends on both how you count the date and... if you do so at all in the first place.
[00:16:46] <emmeka> depends what you're doing with it... it's just going to make the system clock wonky
[00:16:55] <emmeka> this may or may not be important
[00:17:02] <JesseDesu> john titor will come from the future to save us
[00:17:19] <emmeka> same as the Y2K problem, everyone thought the world would end, instead we just got a few signs that were wrong for like 1 day
[00:17:25] <rando25892> hes got a job to do so lets do this

[00:17:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also possible with indirection tables to hack around limitations in direct addressing. 
[00:17:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mean, look at bignums.
[00:17:55] <JesseDesu> the world was supposed to end on dec 21 2012
[00:18:06] <JesseDesu> the mayans predicted
[00:18:12] <rando25892> its astrological significant date though
[00:18:21] <JesseDesu> mayans knew their shit
[00:18:27] <JesseDesu> they invented filtered water
[00:18:42] <rando25892> and impeachment process
[00:18:54] <JesseDesu> and uh, sacrificed each other by pulling out hearts
[00:18:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So you could, if you don't mind the slower processing, simply store the date as a bignum.
[00:19:10] <rando25892> montazulu was stone to death by his own peeps
[00:19:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So long as your system doesn't run out of memory, you can then ignore it.

[00:21:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The issue of it not going beyond a certain point is a microcode problem and would be fixable if processors allowed users to reprogram them to suit their purpose.

[04:38:23] <MootPoot> oh, you mean the ash is needed by the burnt down place itself to regrow?
[04:39:13] <emmeka> intense forest fires create and effect known as hydrophobicity, basically, the fire melts a layer of plant-based lipids into wax, and this actually seals off the soil and makes it impenetrable to water.
[04:40:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On top of too-dry soil not being too permeable to water either...

[04:42:38] <emmeka> MootPoot if you scrape off the ash you're just going to leave the hydrophobic layer, and impenetrable waxy desert.
[04:43:11] <emmeka> MootPoot besides, just burning wood and adding ash to soil isn't actually the best way to do this.

[04:43:50] <MootPoot> mostly ash
[04:44:01] <MootPoot> carbonized wood
[04:44:10] <emmeka> MootPoot in the Amazon, you find pockets of soil like this here and there. They call it "terra preta". Old indigenous civilizations made these, painstakingly, by adding charcoal to the soil over hundreds of years. They're still stable to this day.
[04:44:46] <emmeka> charcoal is when you "burn" wood without oxygen. 
[04:45:17] <MootPoot> what
[04:45:18] <emmeka> it effectively renders wood down to nearly pure carbon
[04:45:23] <MootPoot> you cant burn without o2 tho
[04:45:31] <MootPoot> I'm confused
[04:46:00] <emmeka> yes thus the quotation marks. to make charcoal you just put wood in something without any oxygen inflow, and then heat it up a lot

[04:52:38] <MootPoot> ah
[04:52:38] <MootPoot> okay
[04:52:59] <MootPoot> so is that why the equvalent weight of charcoal will burn longer then equivalent weight of normal wood
[04:54:00] <emmeka> charcoal burns at hotter temperatures too
[04:55:00] <MootPoot> is that beacuse the carbon is different or because the wood essencially has to burn energy to both charcoalize itself AND produce fire at the same time, losing some in the first process ( getting rid of its own sap, water etc ) 
[04:55:01] <emmeka> MootPoot the difference from just adding ash to dirt, though, is that charcoal is long term stable. It more or less permanently raises soil pH and water retention, and adds K that won't run off easily.
[04:55:26] <emmeka> it doesn't "charcoalize itself"
[04:55:34] <emmeka> you need some other wood to make charcoal
[04:55:45] <emmeka> something to burn first, to get it hot
[04:56:02] <MootPoot> afaik burning wood in anything aside from a sealed , compressed chamber is incomplete combustion right
[04:56:19] <MootPoot> and thats what making charcoal is, incomple combustion of wood
[04:56:23] <MootPoot> just more of it
[04:56:25] <emmeka> yes.
[04:56:55] <MootPoot> so any normal log set on fire outside, under normal atmostphereic conditions will to a small degree at least "charcoalize" itself
[04:57:12] <emmeka> yes. this is what you'd see as the "coals" in a fire
[04:57:16] <MootPoot> ah
[04:57:34] <emmeka> whenever you burn large pieces of wood you get at least some charcoal
[04:57:53] <MootPoot> tbh if you didnt have any weight concerns or size concerns it sounds like charcoal is more inefficent for how much heat you get
[04:58:32] *** Quits: nekobit (~desu@user/nekobit) (Quit: ZGVzdSBkZXN1IGRlc3Uh)
[04:58:36] <MootPoot> since the overall amount of carbon that you're burning is the same, its just cleaner burning when purified through charcoal making
[04:58:58] <emmeka> well when you burn charcoal there is very little smoke, and it burns hotter and cleaner, so it's better for some things
[04:59:12] <emmeka> like cooking
[04:59:27] <emmeka> that's why we use charcoal in barbeques and not just straight firewood
[05:00:02] <MootPoot> ah

[05:01:23] <MootPoot> gold?
[05:01:29] <emmeka> Sxem except if you ate enough charcoal you'd probably just die, because it'd completely neutralize your stomach acid.

[05:01:53] <emmeka> so I don't recommend taking a bite.

[07:38:27] <emmeka> isekaijin linux gaming is mostly fine now, thanks to proton...
[07:38:47] <emmeka> it's rare that I find a game which doesn't just work on Steam anymore
[07:38:57] <MootPoot> no, its not
[07:39:14] <MootPoot> anything MP with AC dosen't work, notably
[07:39:28] <MootPoot> I guess if you dont do any competitve MP then it dosen't matter to you
[07:39:59] <MootPoot> afaik certain DX12 only features like ray tracing and DLSS / AMD's version of it dont work
[07:40:13] <MootPoot> its workable..but its not mostly fine imo

[07:40:22] <MootPoot> Anti Cheat
[07:40:26] <emmeka> ah, yeah.

[07:41:20] <MootPoot> but barely any actually get launched on it
[07:41:24] <emmeka> I've had a few cases where proton actually runs a game *better* than on Windows
[07:41:25] <MootPoot> compared to PC at least
[07:41:28] * Matt|home hifives channel
[07:41:52] <emmeka> or at least, it runs better on a dual boot PC in proton than actually running it in windows
[07:42:08] <MootPoot> And the only other thing, idk about mods on proton
[07:42:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yep.
[07:42:24] <MootPoot> well, ANOTHER thing, I hear you still have to tinker with shit pretty often

[07:42:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've had those weird cases of "better-than-windows" too
[07:42:45] <emmeka> every so often I have to go on protondb and run like 1 winetrick or install something
[07:43:01] <emmeka> but 95% of the time it just works now
[07:43:12] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose:  might be because the game dosen't use any of the fancier DX 12 features
[07:43:19] <MootPoot> can you name the games where it runs better?
[07:43:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No, because it has been a few weeks since I last played anything.
[07:43:58] * MootPoot feels sad for Aurora_v_kosmose 
[07:44:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And yes, dx11 downgrade is necessary on those games that are too badly coded to fallback on their own
[07:44:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Why the hell don't they probe and downgrade dynamically?)
[07:44:42] <emmeka> MootPoot one that I remember doing this for me was Frostpunk
[07:44:46] <MootPoot> afaik you cant change dx versions while in game
[07:44:50] <MootPoot> it dosen't work like that
[07:45:10] <MootPoot> the only games that can do it are those with the launhers and the config files to check stuff beforehand

[07:45:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm sure they could do with it dlopen

[09:10:05] <emmeka> the last time I remember anything not working in wine was when silverlight still existed, which thankfully, has been killed with fire
[09:11:29] <isekaijin> Well, no idea. I have not used Windows in ages, unless we count my XP virtual machine, which solely exists so that I can play StarCraft.

[09:13:21] <emmeka> isekaijin a quick check of wine appdb tells me that starcraft runs flawlessly in it, if you run classic and not the remastered one.

[09:14:27] <MootPoot> tbh Aurora_v_kosmose  I think they delayed it on purpose to pair everything together. Windows on ARM has a better emulation layer now and has a full windows 10 build for it, .NET 6 is crossplatform and cross architecture now, 64bit VS2021 and they're pushing having M$ apps on linux and offering M$ stuff compiled for apple silicon like VS code

[09:28:49] <MootPoot> just saw the cover on my manga app
[09:29:04] <emmeka> I thought I had a quote saying that there are only two possible opinions on traps, those who like them and those who are lying to themselves
[09:29:04] <MootPoot> read a chapter and then I was like wait what? is this machine translated
[09:29:13] <davic> TsundereNoises: yes you do. You also need a guy to help you restart the modem

[09:30:45] <davic> TsundereNoises: its because you need the new router they have bought from Huawei, you can rent it as low as 100 usd per mo

[09:31:03] <MootPoot> woah woah woah
[09:31:08] <MootPoot> ur telling him to become a karen?
[09:31:26] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: they really don't want to let me talk to anyone who knows how anything works or has any authority at all
[09:31:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: In inverse order. No, I'm telling him to reach someone who actually has something to do with the business and some sort of actual technical training/knowledge.
[09:31:42] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's important to maintain that absolute worst customer service rating
[09:31:44] <TsundereNoises> they work hard for it
[09:32:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A flowchart is a tool used to verify the logical flow of conditions to new states, usually in a visual manner. A decision tree can be written out as a flowchart.
[09:32:34] <emmeka> I like my ISP. They're just a little local company with a few thousand customers. The tech support guy is the same guy who sits at their front desk of their 1 office in town. his name's Paul.
[09:32:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In fact a flowchar is a visual decision tree.
[09:32:46] <TsundereNoises> it's so weird when I have some issue with my bank and immediately get someone who knows how the fuck bank accounts work on the first try
[09:33:43] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: how devoted are you to completed things?
[09:33:58] <emmeka> reasonably, for now. I have too many ongoing things.
[09:34:38] <TsundereNoises> I have too many ongoing things too
[09:35:30] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: oh, did you read Don't Become an Otaku Shinozaki?
[09:35:41] <TsundereNoises> that's finished
[09:35:50] <emmeka> I did! I loved that one. also, it's like someone literally made a manga with specifically you in mind
[09:36:40] <TsundereNoises> YES
[09:36:52] <TsundereNoises> it's possibly my favorite
[09:36:58] <MootPoot> I'm not very devoted to completing manga
[09:37:04] <TsundereNoises> I have the whole thing in japanese, it's one of my goals to read it in the original
[09:37:08] <MootPoot> mainly cuz the scanlators always seem to go awol
[09:37:10] <emmeka> I have an allergy to dropping things
[09:37:10] <TsundereNoises> but it's surprisingly much harder than bloom into you
[09:37:13] <MootPoot> or the sites dont update
[09:37:15] <TsundereNoises> which I wouldn't have expected
[09:37:23] <MootPoot> so I have like 50 series with only 1 volume 
[09:37:49] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, scanlators vanishing from the face of the internet is a major motivator for me studying the moon runes
[09:38:01] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: there's so much untranslated yuri out there
[09:38:36] <emmeka> I tend to pick things up once the Japanese release finishes and the scanlation is approaching completion, because this usually means that at least somebody will get annoyed enough to make the translation finished
[09:38:51] <emmeka> and, official releases are getting more plentiful these days too
[09:39:22] <MootPoot> tbh I dont care for yuri much
[09:39:28] <TsundereNoises> I'm finally closing in on my goal of being able to read at least some raw yuri
[09:39:30] <TsundereNoises> it's the dream
[09:39:32] <MootPoot> I do like worldbuilding series
[09:39:38] <MootPoot> like the economy isekais
[09:39:40] <TsundereNoises> please ban MootPoot
[09:39:40] <MootPoot> or the farming isekais
[09:39:52] <MootPoot> please spank TsundereNoises 
[09:39:54] <emmeka> you'd chose isekai over yuri?!
[09:40:11] <TsundereNoises> I have never known such a pitiful failure of a human being
[09:40:12] <emmeka> I guess I should expect this from the man who won't admit that he likes traps

[09:41:05] <emmeka> I've been meaning to get to the LNs of Otherside Picnic because supposedly they're much better
[09:41:13] <MootPoot> aside from people going on about the yuri the rest of it dosent have any substance
[09:41:21] <MootPoot> although I only watched dthe anime
[09:41:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh fuck you youtube
[09:41:37] <emmeka> the anime was a bit mediocre and the yuri too light to make up for it

[09:42:59] <MootPoot> even without the ecchi par
[09:43:07] <MootPoot> I would have watched the shit out of it
[09:43:46] <MootPoot> stores where the environment exists and actually has power rather then simply bending to the characters wills as needed, I have a thing for them
[09:43:58] <MootPoot> An Actual World! With Rules! and Events and Concequences!
[09:44:03] <MootPoot> I'll take 20
[09:44:13] <MootPoot> gtfo with that deus ex machina shit
[09:45:24] <emmeka> I'd say a lot of isekai get a bit too lost in the formula of their world in lieu of giving us a good plot. like sure, the exposition dumps give us a very nice world that you have crafted with painstaking care, but if the characters are lame who gives a shit?
[09:45:53] <MootPoot> the issue is the vast majority do very little worldbuilding
[09:45:58] <MootPoot> and ALSO have shit characters
[09:46:35] <MootPoot> they might introduce it for a bit in the start, but that world dosent have any..power
[09:46:51] <MootPoot> like Re:zero is a example of good worldbuilding and good characters
[09:47:04] <MootPoot> interspecies reviews is a exmaple of bleh characters and good worldbuilding
[09:47:09] <TsundereNoises> although I'm not sure how much care really goes into most isekai worlds either
[09:47:10] <emmeka> I'm fairly disillusioned with isekai for now. I mean sure I will eternally love re:zero and fangirl to shit whenever a new season comes, but besides that, very little has impressed me in recent years
[09:47:15] <TsundereNoises> a lot of them are pretty half-assed
[09:47:19] <MootPoot> the otherside picnic anime is garbage on both
[09:47:29] <MootPoot> same with that egg anime

[09:48:49] <emmeka> MootPoot I think Otherside Picnic just didn't translate to the medium well. horror stories rarely make good anime, and that's what it's supposed to be.
[09:49:03] <MootPoot> but the biggest thing I like is when the environment has actual POWER and its rules are actual rules
[09:49:27] <MootPoot> the world is not simply a canvas for your own idealized shit to happen
[09:49:46] <Nanobot> Rule: If you are female, you will fall in love with MC
[09:49:51] <MootPoot> ^
[09:49:56] <emmeka> the whole thing is basically a horror story in the style of Japanese urban legends
[09:50:23] <emmeka> Nanobot hey, there's... Ram...
[09:50:34] <MootPoot> I'm okay with some degree of environment giving way to hero, like goblin slayer
[09:50:49] <MootPoot> but goblin slayer had good worldbuilidng as well, and the world had power
[09:51:24] <emmeka> I like Ram, if only because she totally defies the role you'd anticipate for her based on her character archetype. She has her own entire plot only tangentially linked to Subaru and that's pretty cool.
[09:51:56] <MootPoot> Thats another part of good worldbuilding imo ^
[09:52:03] <MootPoot> the characters exist to do more then simply serve MC

[15:04:06] <Llamamoe> Anyway, thank you MootPoot
[15:04:17] <Llamamoe> RenAdjest: WDYM ?
[15:05:58] <RenAdjest> The smart contract need to be perfect with no exploit whatsoever. However, creating software without bugs is impossible.
[15:08:00] <RenAdjest> In real life, if you lose moneys there is a loophole (bugs) in contract, you can fight it in the courts and hopefully get your money back.
[15:08:53] <RenAdjest> In block chain, the code is the laws. So if hacker use the bugs, they get to keep their moneys.

[20:54:49] <isekaijin> Now, is it possible to create this virtual device if I only have the emulator installed, or do I need to install the whole SDK?

[22:20:55] <name100> hi beaky 
[22:21:14] <SpiritOfSummer> but I found an anime site that provides optional quality downloads for every show they have
[22:21:30] <SpiritOfSummer> I might switch to them to be honest, it's just the convenience of getting from video to video sucks on there
[22:21:35] <SpiritOfSummer> dubhappy had that figured out.
[22:21:58] <SpiritOfSummer> regardless it is worth it to ensure I will never rely on internet connection to see anime ever again
[22:22:06] <SpiritOfSummer> I never did anyway
[22:22:28] <SpiritOfSummer> downloading black clover was annoying because there was no whole series torrent so yeah I had to individually download 100 plus episodes
[22:22:54] <SpiritOfSummer> and if the download files weren't already numbered to be arranged in order right from the download I would have stapled my fuckin ballsack to the ceiling
