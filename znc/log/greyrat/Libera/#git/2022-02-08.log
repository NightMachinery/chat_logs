[01:14:04] <j416> you can even ignore .gitignore itself (go figure, but I use this often)

[01:21:39] <j416> I find having a .gitignore is easier than using .git/info/exclude, because then getting rid of it all is a simple "git clean -dfx" and I don't have to remember that I had things ignored

[08:13:57] <k8yun> so I've been reading through git workflows for beginners but I still don't get the purpose of having bare git repo.  If remote **bare** git repo has no working directory, how does a new client executing `git clone` of the repo from the remote git repo collect the the clone of the repo?

[08:17:12] <k8yun> First client which created a local git repo with `git init` has all the working directories.  Remote git repo with `git --bare init` will only have .git related files without no working directory.  The new client requesting `git clone` to the remote git repo (which is of type bare) won't be able to find the files in the remote git repo, meaning the client must get them from the first client.  So I don't get why all the online tutorials set up the
[08:17:12] <k8yun> remote git repo as `git init --bare`.
[08:21:56] <rewt> a working directory is basically a checkout of the files from the repo; these are only local, and are not needed in order to have a repo
[08:22:04] <rewt> the repo contains all files that are in the repo
[08:22:41] <rewt> when you clone the repo, you clone the repo, not the working directory of the remote (if it even has one)
[08:24:48] <rewt> the .git directory and the files within _is_ the repo; that's all you need on the remote

[08:39:45] <rewt> when you make a commit, git stores the files as objects in the repo (in the .git dir); they don't show as actual files
[08:40:30] <rewt> the files you see in your working dir are the state of the files of the commit that's checked out (plus any modifications, ofc)

[14:50:01] <ikke> makara1: packed refs
[14:50:25] <canton7> ls-remote goes and talks to the remote -- it doesn't use what's in your local git repo at all. You can run ls-remote outside of any git repo, if you give it a URL
[14:51:17] <canton7> It's possible for the remote to have tags which you don't have, of course, if you've never fetched them
[14:51:33] <canton7> Its output is not related to GC -- it only reports the tags which the remote machine says that it has
[14:51:48] <canton7> Whether the tags are annotated or not is not relevant here
[14:51:51] <makara1> is it reporting an annotated tag or a non-annotated tag?
[14:52:05] <makara1> of course its relevant! Its my question
[14:52:31] <ikke> makara1: The only difference is that an annotated tag points to a tag object, while a light-weight tag points to a commit
[14:52:41] <canton7> Git reports both types of tags the same way, in almost all cases
[14:52:49] <ikke> You cannot see the difference when just looking at the refs
[14:53:16] <osse> you can tell from ls-remote by checking the hashes of refs/tags/foo and refs/tags/foo^{}
[14:53:37] <osse> I think perhaps ^{} is there only when its annotated
[14:53:40] <osse> *it's
[14:53:55] <makara1> i am seeing both

[15:24:56] <canton7> But, see whether 'git fetch --tags' brings in the tags first
[15:25:20] <makara1> the refspec I used pulled them down ??
[15:25:42] <canton7> Yeah, but it put them somewhere that the rest of git isn't expecting them to be
[15:25:43] <makara1> oh
[15:25:48] <canton7> E.g. I doubt 'git tag' will list them
[15:26:06] <canton7> Or maybe it'll show them as literally called e.g. 'origin/v1.2.3'
[15:26:41] <makara1> yes it does that

[15:31:52] <canton7> Right, but it's a useful litmus test to narrow down specifically what the issue is, so you know what config to add
[15:32:44] <canton7> Setting remote.origin.tagOpt is probably easier, as osse recommended. It's a shame there doesn't seem to be a way to set that globally

[16:00:12] <bookworm> that shows changes added to the index
[16:00:27] <bookworm> so it depends on if you added files with giat add or not
[16:00:36] <bookworm> git*
[16:00:38] <nazarewk[m]> looks like `git diff --cached` works only on new files and `git diff` on not git added?
[16:00:47] <nazarewk[m]> can i make the command independent?
[16:01:47] <bookworm> git diff shows the difference of your local filesystem and the other thing (defaulting to the current commit) git diff --staged or git diff --cached the difference between the index and the other end
[16:02:26] <bookworm> what do you mean by independent? They already are independent

[20:05:09] <pingpongball> what should i do ?
[20:05:18] <gnoo> make the change, git commit --amend

[20:06:43] <pingpongball> oh same git ammend thankyou
[20:06:47] <canton7> srinidhi, that's not related to worktrees. I think 'stale info' appears because you're using '--force-with-lease'?
[20:09:22] <pingpongball> Thank you gnoo :*

[20:48:21] <ikke> The new ort merge strategy would make something like that more feasible, so maybe it will be added in the future
[20:48:51] <j416> at least for now, it's easy enough to just merge/rebase and then abort or undo if you're not happy with the result
[20:49:05] <j416> an easy way would be to create a "backup branch" before you start, then reset back to that
[20:49:11] <j416> otherwise, the reflog has you covered
[20:49:36] <ikke> forges like git(hub|lab) do exactly that, just try the merge, and if there's a conflict, report that
[20:49:40] <j416> or, even just taking note of the hash of the commit before you start, would be enough.
[20:49:59] <ikke> You could just do it in a dedicated tree/repo and discard it
[20:50:44] <j416> doing it in detached HEAD mode would also be an option; then you could just check out the other branch and you'll be back to whatever you had before
