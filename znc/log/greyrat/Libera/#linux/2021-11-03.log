[03:10:27] <kittonian> hi all. I need some help with logrotate. I am using docker and am remapping user ids via userns-remap. I have the log files outside of the docker container via volume mounts and am trying to setup logrotate. The issue is that I need to retain permissions and user/group ownership. This is normally not an issue and I would use create 644 user group in the logrotate file. However, I can't use actual usernames, and instead have to us
[03:10:27] <kittonian> e IDs.
[03:10:43] <velix> ayecee: So they have the same problems as we do.
[03:10:50] <ayecee> heh
[03:10:52] <byte4byte_mac> kittonian, pm jim hes the linux master
[03:10:52] <kittonian> The problem is that the IDs do not exist on the host, only inside the docker container, and logrotate won't allow me to use the IDs, only the names.
[03:11:20] <ayecee> kittonian: what happens when you try to use the IDs/
[03:11:43] <kittonian> logrotate throws an error saying the user doesn't exist
[03:11:53] <ayecee> what is the error message?
[03:12:00] <kittonian> and it's correct. the user does not exist on the local host
[03:12:17] <ayecee> and, how did you try to retain it?

[03:17:42] <velix> Yeah, logrotate's "su" can handle names only, no IDs.
[03:18:17] <kittonian> it's not just one user. there are tons of them across tons of different containers
[03:18:18] <velix> kittonian: or do ACL on the logs to make it readable from the logrotate user?
[03:18:31] <velix> kittonian: or use journald ;)
[03:18:39] <ayecee> kittonian: so bad news, there's no way to do this with logrotate without modifying logrotate. the good news is that a patch is available. the bad news is that you'd have to recompile it yourself.

[03:21:02] <LordOfThePings> in logrotate you can maybe sudo as the userid to switch to that user id to rotate logs
[03:21:04] <LordOfThePings> ?
[03:21:17] <velix> ayecee: then just "su user group" vs. "su-id 1234 1234" :D
[03:21:24] <ayecee> kittonian: better get the logrotate source package from apt then, and apply the patch there.

[03:22:25] <kittonian> so, i was thinking about that and wondering if that would work. because couldn't I just do a post-rotate and put chown 500100.500101?
[03:22:29] <kittonian> instead of a create?
[03:22:48] <velix> uhhhh wait. wait wait wait.
[03:22:53] <ayecee> kittonian: sure, create as root owned, then chown it in the post rotate.
[03:22:59] <velix> kittonian: Why don't you just join the namespace ???
[03:23:08] <velix> kittonian: And run logrotate from there.
[03:23:14] <ayecee> there's a "just" in there that's not justified
[03:23:17] <velix> That's how it was done in Podman.
[03:23:19] <kittonian> velix, that would sort of defeat the entire purpose of the security of remapping
[03:23:39] <kittonian> and i might as well just take out all the remapping if they were joined anyway
[03:23:42] <velix> kittonian: No, since you're in the namespace. and you're just rotating logs ;)

[04:43:33] <Psi-Jack> That doesn't seem unusual to me really for an old low power CPU.
[04:43:56] <ayecee> when's the last time you used a really old low power CPU :P
[04:44:22] <VMGuy23> 1gb ram, 7200rpm HDD, Intel Atom n455, Mint 20.2 with i3. NetworkManager Applet is running, so is a clipboard manager, and MATE power manager

[12:38:36] <guru> \033 is the C-style octal code for an escape character. The [999D moves the cursor back 999 columns, presumably a brute force way of getting to the start of the line. [2K erases the current line. \r is a carriage return which will move the cursor back to the start of the current line and is a C-style escape sequence rather than a terminal control sequence.

[17:40:25] <cottnn> the `cut` way is pretty good, but is it possible to somehow ask the kernel directly about the default gateway?

[17:40:51] <ananke> merpaderp: 'wan' is a vague concept in this case anyway. what qualifies as a 'wan ip'? if you're on RFC1918 network, is that a 'wan'?
[17:41:14] <PaulFertser> cottnn: directly would be writing a program to use libnl to enumerate the routes you mean?

[17:46:20] <cottnn> and in cases when you're behind nat it's the only way i think

[23:09:25] <rendar> ok
[23:09:36] <rendar> but i'm dealing with storage devices
[23:10:01] <hexnewbie> rendar: No. That's not a way to check if something is mountable. Some regular files are mountable. Some block devices are not. Most character devices are not, mtd1 is. Some storage character devices are not.

[23:10:37] <rendar> hexnewbie, regular files are mountable only with loops devices which will fake a block device..
[23:10:49] <hexnewbie> /dev/bus/usb/x/y can be your MTP camera, and be completely unmountable with the mount command
