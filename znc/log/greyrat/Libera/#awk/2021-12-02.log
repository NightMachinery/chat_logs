[00:56:18] <e36freak> got fucked on leaderboarding for today because server issues :(
[00:58:00] <earnest> Always blaming lag
[00:58:46] <Patsie> ah, new aoc. lets have a look how far I can keep my interest this year :)
[00:59:47] <e36freak> kept getting 503 or 504 when trying to submit
[01:00:02] <e36freak> was a perfect problem for awk too
[01:01:44] <seninha> Last year I gave up at day 20
[01:02:16] <seninha> let's see how far I go this year: https://github.com/phillbush/aoc
[01:09:30] <e36freak> did the whole thing in awk last year
[01:09:51] <e36freak> i'd like to do C but it'd take too long to be competetive, maybe i'll do both this year
[01:10:28] <e36freak> 23 was the only one i ranked on last year, usually get one

[16:56:42] <Patsie> that sounds very multi-dimensional array. if you have gawk, then it should be easy
[16:56:50] <concrete-houses> that belham should be on same level as the 300
[16:57:03] <concrete-houses> I could get mawk or gawk

[16:57:51] <concrete-houses> I failed

[17:01:39] <earnest> SUBSEP yeah
[17:01:55] <Patsie> that's not multi-dim
[17:02:10] <emanuele6> that is how the POSIX spec calls it
[17:02:12] <Patsie> that's still single dim since you can't loop over each sub item individually
[17:02:20] <Patsie> but yeah, one sec concrete-houses 
[17:02:47] <earnest> Hm
[17:03:14] <earnest> There are two ways with posix awk to address arrays, one is specifically for multi-dim, I wonder.  Never actually bothered with them before

[17:10:42] * yeti always loves to avoid the G before the awk
[17:11:10] <concrete-houses> lol
[17:11:17] <concrete-houses> thank you Patsie and others
[17:11:30] <concrete-houses> let me try them as see!
[17:13:16] <yeti> I hope gawk will diverge so much from awk that it gets an own channel
[17:15:23] <Patsie> concrete-houses: if you run into an issue, show us what you've tried and maybe we can steer you in the right direction
[17:15:53] <concrete-houses>  ok
[17:19:02] <concrete-houses> how would I for example do the total? yeti your one doesn't work for me but I am using gawk.... is there some posix mode I need to flag ? hm
[17:19:37] <concrete-houses> awk: cmd. line:2:               "\t%s",T[n,c] ; printf "\n" } }
[17:19:38] <concrete-houses> awk: cmd. line:2:                     ^ syntax error
[17:19:40] <concrete-houses> hmm
[17:19:57] <Patsie> in the part where the values are defined, you can define a new array with 'total' and use the country/$1 as an index
[17:20:00] <yeti> no idea... my default is mawk
[17:20:14] <concrete-houses> oh let me install that
[17:20:39] <emanuele6> that awk code is posix compliant, you probably have a typo
[17:20:50] <concrete-houses> or a copy paste error
[17:21:49] <emanuele6> well, if it is printing   line:2: "\t%s",T[n,c] ; printf "\n" } }, you probably don't have the printf on the same line, which is not syntactically valid.
[17:24:17] <concrete-houses> works
[17:24:31] <concrete-houses> interesting cut paste error somehow made 2 lines
[17:24:44] <concrete-houses> I cut the teo peices into one line and worked
[17:27:56] <concrete-houses> where do I learn awk?
[17:28:15] <concrete-houses> If I can get the total on the end I will have solved the problem
[17:29:46] <Patsie> a good thing I already gave you the help to get it done then
[17:30:18] <emanuele6> from patsie's solution, you only need to add two statements to get the total
[17:30:33] <Patsie> < Patsie> in the part where the values are defined, you can define a new array with 'total' and use the country/$1 as an index
[17:32:05] <earnest> (Or just add it together when printing)
[17:33:20] <emanuele6> ^

[20:32:29] <emanuele6> another option is { value[$1]["total"] += $3 }, but then total is not guaranteed to be at the end
[20:34:10] <emanuele6> and another option is to have total+=value[country][product] inside the `product in value[country]' and printf("%10s\n", total) after that loop

[21:03:39] <patanga> e36freak: thanks for the idea to add values of a column and put them into an arry to calculate the distance the values from the mean in the END. Makes a nice 2 liner or so.
[21:04:42] <patanga> Patsie: maybe even 10 liners are long awk scripts. But definitely there were serious scripts with calculations in the 90ies written in Awk, which were more than just one-liners.
[21:05:23] <patanga> Jarko Oikarinnen, the inventor of IRC, works for Google since 10 years, developing Google Chat, Google Hangouts.
[21:05:50] <patanga> IRC is still a valid place, for instance the CSS specs are developed on the w3c irc network.
[21:06:10] <yitz> Oof. Had I known that two years ago, I might've been able to grab lunch with the inventor of IRC :s

[21:09:56] <patanga> e36freak: awk seems to be perfectly suited for the calculation of the standard deviation etc of a column of a text file.
[21:13:51] <yitz> patanga: that's correct
[21:14:23] <yitz> I used to sit in the Google Apps section for a period, which included Hangouts/Chats
[21:15:14] <patanga> oh! Oikarinnen might work on a European campus, he is Finnish.

[21:34:53] <yitz> patanga: I had dinner with Weinberger several years back :) 
[21:35:10] <yitz> I left Google for something I prefer even more than Google.
[21:35:27] <yitz> I don't think Google would return to XMPP after abandoning it

[21:36:43] <earnest> All I did was mention that Kernighan said in a lecture he was surprised to see large awk programs (a macro compiler in this case) because he had intended awk to be used for mostly oneliners.  Then you started going on about how kernighan is rubbish and that he's no guru, his work is bad, etc.
[21:36:52] <earnest> And I had no idea what was going on anymore

[21:46:26] <patanga> earnest: all I said was that a recent book of Kernighan, "D for Digital", does not seem to be written by a guru. This means that the book, which talks about various trivial matters, and Javascript as well, did not make a good impression on me. It does not mean, that I want to see Kernighan as a guru, even if many consider him as a UNIX guru per excellence.
[21:47:12] <patanga> then you said that you did not want to continue such a "weird discussion" with me. This is offensive language by definition.
[21:47:33] <earnest> Yeah, I don't want to continue this weird discussion either
[21:48:22] <patanga> right there!
