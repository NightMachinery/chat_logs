[04:47:02] <JTL> ah okay
[04:47:11] <rawktucc> the case will simply sit in a storage locker, or in my room, from may - december, and at that point either I'll sell most of them (keeping the 18TBs), or rebuild a local machine

[23:21:41] <brimstone> ,pizza sarnold 
[23:21:41] * unfinity sends sarnold a medium size Chicago Deep Dish cheese and rucula pizza with an extra of mustard chicken.
[23:22:03] <sarnold> mmmmmmmmm pizzzzzza
[23:22:26] <sarnold> maybe the chicken is creeping out the ducks
[23:23:04] <rawktucc> the one pizza I really want to try is cheese stuffed crust pizza
[23:23:15] <rawktucc> The only problem is lactose will screw up my digestion real bad
[23:23:32] <rawktucc> I would love to find a pizza place offering vegan cheeze as an option for that
[23:23:39] <rawktucc> they're little balls of fun
[23:25:04] <sarnold> mmmm well now I want some cheesy breadsticks...

[23:27:08] <rawktucc> those would be awesome, but I still think a funky little ball of cheeze on a pizza would be cool as heck

[23:27:48] <sarnold> bummer about the lactose intolerance :( are the vegan cheeses even remotely enjoyable?
[23:27:55] <sarnold> it feels like something that would be difficult to do well
[23:43:03] <rawktucc> i love the vegan cheeses. Daiya is a good brand
[23:43:30] <rawktucc> I would say at this point it's an intolerance since I've been eating vegan for a while so eating anything dairy screws me up bad
