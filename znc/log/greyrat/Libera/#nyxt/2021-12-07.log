[20:54:54] <jayloofah> And coverting the deb to rpm with alien throws some errors on install - so does running the bin

[22:41:33] <w0rm> I feel like any/all "packaging format" conversion tools will be very limited - "distro native" builds are the only way to make things really work/integrate
[22:43:05] <w0rm> i.e. alien has no clue about all the distro-specific differences - that's what the package maintainers are for IMO. It's nice to offer some basic flatpak/whatever form but ultimately distro maintainers would need to package things
