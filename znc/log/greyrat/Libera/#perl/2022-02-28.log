[10:43:55] <msk`> q: why does the 'configure' script begin with upper-case 'C' character, instead of the normal 'configure' script ?
[10:46:20] <rindolf> msk`: hi, there is 'git archive'

[16:55:07] <aquanight> but if you're not specifically talking about dualvar() and just happen to be dealing with scalars that have both flags set, that's just a normal consequence of perl code working with scalars in general.
[16:55:25] <aquanight> in which case the answer is "pick what type of data you care about and just use it"
[16:56:28] <ilmari> yeah, most of the time it's just a matter of using the appropriate numeric or stringy operations on the value, and perl will DTRT

[21:02:36] <simcop2387> these days it tries to scale it until there's some idle time happening and then heuristically decides when to go back down
[21:02:52] <simcop2387> basically it does something like "try to keep 5-10% idle if possible"
[21:02:59] *** Quits: Adois (~Adoi@user/adoi) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:03:46] <aquanight> for heat the answer is simple
[21:03:52] <aquanight> dunk the thing in an oil bath.
[21:03:54] <simcop2387> i think it used to be on or off largely because in the P4 era, scaling was very very jittery and difficult to handle properly
[21:05:05] <Exodist> aquanight: I was briefly a highschool teacher. At the time several students saw the oil immersed computers on youtube or similar. So I took one of the old pc's in the lab apart and we did an oil immersion PC right there at the school, the kids loved it!
[21:05:31] <aquanight> can't remember exactly what it was but I recall seeing some configuration where they just dunk the entire mainboard in some oil bath and it had just one shitty fan exchanger in the corner and it had zero problem at full tilt.
[21:05:48] <aquanight> Exodist: yeah that's what I was thinking of
[21:06:09] <Exodist> yeah, we had no case, it was just the motherboard and cards in the oil, left the cpu fan on it and it spun, but slowly, and there were no temp problems
[21:06:29] <aquanight> the one I saw I don't think they even bothered with a cpu fan
[21:06:36] <Exodist> this was back in 2007 I think, give or take a year
[21:06:47] <Exodist> it is more that we did not bother to remove the fan.
[21:06:49] <aquanight> I even wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even have a normal heatsink (since you had the oil)
[21:07:18] <aquanight> I imagine the oil would provide better heat displacement than the heatsink.

[21:07:43] <Exodist> before retiring the machine (throwing it away) we did remove the fan and heat sync and turned it on, there was obvious thermal movement that looked almost like the oil was starting to boil, just above the cpu, and it did fry, as in the system stopped working, it was the final experiment of the system
[21:07:59] <aquanight> though these days I don't think it's physically possible to run a cpu without sink - if only because mainboards pretty much design the to use the weight of the heatsink to lock the CPU in.
[21:08:45] <buZz> Exodist: removed heatsink and -then turned it off? :D
[21:09:01] <buZz> i like that style
[21:09:18] <aquanight> what was the story I think I heard? someone had a P4 where the heatsink fell off and the thing just kept going (at massively corked speed but still)
[21:09:27] <Exodist> lol. No, turned it off, rmeoved n and heat sink, put it back int he oil, turned it on, then saw shimmering oil above the cpu, then the thing stopped working before linux could boot up.
[21:09:56] <Exodist> wow, I think my wireless keyboard had a hiccup there
[21:12:05] <buZz> could be, some RF protocols have retransmit capabilities and requires receiver to reorder if not sequential
[21:12:33] <simcop2387> aquanight: that can work on more modern processors, don't know if the p4 could thermal throttle itself good enough for that.  i know AMD ones of that era didn't survive that (from experience)

[23:21:43] <buZz> lemme test
[23:21:55] <buZz> i'm not sure ppl upgraded the stuff
[23:22:01] <buZz> and i'm over 5gigglehz wifi
[23:23:04] <buZz> lol just getting 20/10 over wifi
[23:23:16] <buZz> i -think- we have at least 60 down
[23:23:28] <Botje> there's a "gigabit upgrade" I can get but pretty sure it's a scam
[23:23:33] <buZz> but supposedly we could get a lot more up with a different dsl modem

[23:51:12] <simcop2387> has anyone seen any weird issues with perl.bot today? i got it on ipv6 again the other night
[23:51:46] <simcop2387> also it's really fun having a /56 so that all my vlans get their own ipv6 space and have a firewall between them
