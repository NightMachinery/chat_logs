[09:08:11] <causative_> the problem of truth is very practical if you are trying to design an AI, because the AI needs to build an accurate and effective model of the world around it - a true model, that's also useful to it
[09:08:37] <causative_> so you need an operational notion of truth - an understanding of what kind of quality truth is, and what kinds of processes might produce it or tend towards it
[09:09:20] <causative_> it's easier to say what isn't true than what is true
[09:09:48] <causative_> if you have a set of propositions that yield a contradiction, we can say they are not all true
[09:10:19] <causative_> when I say "yield a contradiction" there are two concepts at play.  First, "yielding":  it is implied that the propositions may combine with one another to form new ones according to some rules of inference
[09:10:31] <causative_> and second, "contradiction":  it is implied that some propositions are incompatible with others
[09:11:12] <causative_> if we want to design a brain-like AI, "contradiction" must be a more fundamental concept than merely placing a negation sign at the start of a string of characters
[09:11:42] <causative_> because a brain-like AI is a neural AI; we should depend on neural dynamics, not special symbols
[09:12:06] <causative_> so we need a deeper notion of contradiction
[09:13:24] <causative_> (and incidentally, a deeper notion of "proposition" as well; a proposition cannot be a string of symbols, because it must be neural.)

[12:40:21] <causative_> it's crazy how many things CS Peirce was right about, like the fact that a belief is best thought of as a pattern of behavior
[12:41:29] <causative_> that's exactly the right way to think about beliefs if you want to be maximally general, and not require that it be a symbolic proposition or a sequence of words
[12:42:17] <causative_> because it's conceivable to have minds that don't use symbolic propositions or sequences of words, but that navigate the world effectively nonetheless
[12:42:42] <causative_> and these minds would still have beliefs - they would still have brain patterns of some kind that would cause patterns of behavior

[13:06:50] <arryana> i seem to recall the quote is 'wherever you go, there you are'
[13:08:23] <vysn> Thank you for the correction, but why assume I am referring to that quote? :)

[13:15:10] <arryana> it's a chatroom, not a classroom.  if you have any topic you want to raise, other people will engage if they find it compelling.
[13:15:46] <vysn> have you read them?

[13:22:09] <mycroftiv> hi vysn, i hope you are doing well today
[13:24:12] <arryana> you're butthurt all out of proportion to my comments.  just /ignore me if you're so fragile.
[13:25:51] <vysn> you are in a philosophy channel, act like it and respect the intelligence of everyone in this channel is all I am saying.
[13:26:31] <vysn> engage with the flow of a conversation if you are interested otherwise ignore it.
[13:26:41] <arryana> you;re not an op.  keep your sense of entitlement in check.
[13:26:48] <arryana> i won't be responding to such tantrums further.
[13:27:06] <vysn> no need to bless us with passive aggressiveness every single time
[13:28:34] <mycroftiv> vysn: ive learned a lot from arryana in discussion, although some of what ive learned is that if someone has decided to take a sour attitude towards me, im unlikely to win them over
[13:29:03] <vysn> if you are going to keep that up I would like you to kindly ask you to  never respond nor engage with me ever, if you are going to have a civil philosophy themed conversation you are welcome to engage.
[13:29:45] <arryana> waaaah.  /ignore me if you don't like my conversation.  you have no authority to police it.

[13:54:03] <vysn> krb: That's interesting, but it seems very capitalist! you can argue that the elderly loose their productive value, does this mean we should no longer respect them?
[13:55:02] <krb> should a child listen to a elder only because he is older? like for example a child was asked by some random old person to jump into the van where he would give candy..
[13:55:45] <arryana> there are a lot of 'adults' who never matured past being childish.
[13:56:17] <vysn> a child shouldn't I agree.
[13:56:50] <vysn> but a child can still respect an elderly person and still not listen to them.
[13:57:11] <vysn> lets put the elderly aside for a second.
[13:58:53] <arryana> as to whether anyone should listen to anyone else is a personal call.  there's no universal rule that'd apply.
[13:59:26] <vysn> what about kids themselves, or the helpless, those who have no value to us what so ever. if we base every single aspect of our engagement on value, we might live very empty lives imho
[14:05:00] <mycroftiv> vysn: or perhaps we might shift the definitions/vocabulary a bit and say there can be Value even without 'utility'
[14:06:06] <mycroftiv> most of the universe has no particular 'use' to me, (nor I to it!), but it still has immense value
[14:07:49] <vysn> That's fair
[14:08:22] <krb> "respect must be earned", respect by title... theres allot of deprecated things
[14:09:16] <mycroftiv> hmm 'deprecated concepts' - i like this
[14:09:32] <mycroftiv> the socio-conceptual software can update and deprecate concepts
[14:09:39] <krb> the concept of respect might have shifted morality toward a gain based morality
[14:10:18] <arryana> how do you define 'respect'?
[14:10:35] <mycroftiv> i just listen to Aretha
[14:10:55] <arryana> too many people seem to use it to mean 'give value to whatever i say or think or you're not respecting me'
[14:11:06] <arryana> when what they say or think is patently wrong or pointless.
[14:11:18] <krb> to regard, admire, obey..
[14:11:28] <arryana> i mean, do you respect the validity of flat earthers' thinking?
[14:11:54] <arryana> why should anyone do that unless what they hear has a factual basis?
[14:13:04] <mycroftiv> as I understand it, there are 4 simultaneous rotations of the earth in each 24 hour day, making thus a full 96 hour simultaneous Time Cube, so the earth is neither flat nor round but Cubical
[14:13:17] <vysn> krb:  it is and it can be misused I agree
[14:17:32] <krb> fake news often use famous names
[14:17:42] <krb> and people respect whatever
[14:20:02] <vysn> "respect should be earned" while I agree, partially, are you suggesting that we should not respect anyone unless someones words or actions earn our respect, or unless we are aware of someone's past experiences that call for respect?
[14:20:29] <arryana> hang on.  are you claiming to believe that the earth is square?
[14:21:10] <vysn> if so, then if someone has an admirable past and we are not aware of it, and therefore we do not give them our respect, aren't we in the wrong?
[14:21:41] <vysn> aren't we better off starting with respect and then allowing people to enforce or remove it altogether?
[14:23:19] <vysn> not all widely expressed respect is fake.

[18:52:37] <zicada> dunz0r: Ah, i thought you meant free as in you dont need a loan
[18:52:47] <dunz0r> zicada: I don't, because I have a job
[18:53:02] <dunz0r> zicada: The studies cost me 0 money.
[18:53:26] <zicada> dunz0r: In Norway students get part of their studentloan converted to a stipend as they complete classes, up to 405
[18:53:29] <zicada> 40%
[18:53:47] <zicada> but its not enough, so you gotta work too
[18:54:07] <zicada> but if you have to work full-time, it's going to be difficult completing a uni-degree
[18:54:35] <vysn> dunz0r: I suggest you read/watch Cornel West, I quoted him several days here, philosophy is about the formation of attention, the attention to the issues that matter the most, and the empowering ways by which we can creatively respond.
[18:54:58] <zicada> But tuition-free is clearly a great perk. And its not just for us Norwegians and Swedes right, anyone can come go to Uni here
[18:55:11] <dunz0r> zicada: Here students who earn under a fairly low limit get paid roughly ~3000 SEK or something. And you can take a nice loan at about 8-10k SEK. I am however reading at a reduced pace, while working. Not to pursue a degree
[18:55:21] <dunz0r> vysn: I will, thanks for the tip :)
[18:55:49] <vysn> yw
[18:55:52] <zicada> dunz0r: ah, that sounds nice. I did something similar 10years or so ago. Took a bachelor over 4 years while working as a consultant

[18:57:38] <dunz0r> Already have a vocational degree, the philosophy studies are purely for my own enjoyment :)
[18:57:40] <zicada> im sure it would be fun to do philo in an academic setting, but on the other hand there are so many great resources now
[18:58:48] <dunz0r> zicada: I find it helps me to have the lecturer explain stuff, and have "read this text, and also this complementary stuff". Really helps with some texts, since reading philosophy can be quite cumbersome

[19:07:53] <zicada> dunz0r: in Norway and Denmark, to go to Uni you have to complete a course called "examen philosophicum". This topic appears to be pretty common on those exams.
[19:10:18] <dunz0r> zicada: Platons Theaitetos actually
[19:11:10] <zicada> dunz0r: yea thats a work of his. Teleology is not a work, but a concept he is interested in. The Telos
[19:11:27] <zicada> its about substances and their "reasons for being"

[22:23:15] <causative_> to be rational, it is necessary to have a fundamental insecurity about one's beliefs - the feeling that they really might be wrong, that their footing is unstable, and that you need strong reassurance in the form of rational justification to even begin to think otherwise
