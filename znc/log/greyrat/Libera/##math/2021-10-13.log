[00:56:50] <gganbu> The probability of getting all heads or all tails, and then we partition this by choice of binomial coefficients?
[00:57:05] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[00:57:11] <greenbagels> it's more than the probability of getting all heads or all tails; if i give you any sequence of 10 rolls, the chance of getting that sequence is 1/2^10
[00:57:29] <greenbagels> because there's 2^10 different sequences of 10 flips

[02:18:34] <PlanckWalk> If the coin guilty probability is c then you get  p^2c + p^2(1-c) + p(1-p)c + (1-p)pc.  (I originally had (1-c) at the end of the last term)
[02:18:48] <PlanckWalk> For c=1/2 that simplifies to p.

[02:19:53] <PlanckWalk> What.
[02:20:21] <learner36> I'm assuming the judges in the 3-panel are independent, 2 of them each choose correctly with probability p
[02:20:53] <PlanckWalk> p is a given parameter
[02:21:11] <learner36> yeah, if p is greater than 0.732051 you want the 3-panel

[02:21:49] *** Joins: mestre (~mestre@191.177.175.57)
[02:22:03] <learner36> I interpreted the question differently
[02:22:43] <learner36> I interpreted it to say that there are 3 judges in the 3-panel, one chooses correct with probability p, another chooses correct with probability p, and another flips a coin (probability 0.5)

[02:23:32] <learner36> oh yeah, my bad
[02:23:54] <PlanckWalk> I can see Oli's interpretation being reasonable too though.
[02:23:56] <learner36> you're right
[02:24:07] <PlanckWalk> But both give the same outcome.
[02:24:31] <learner36> so P(3-panel correct
[02:25:21] *** Joins: lxlldr (~I@a89-152-175-20.cpe.netcabo.pt)
[02:26:14] <learner36> so P(3-panel correct|guilty)=2*p^2*0.5+p*0.5*(1-p)*2 which is the same as what you have... P(3-panel correct
[02:26:49] <PlanckWalk> "two judges decide correctly with probability p" can mean "two judges together decide correctly, with probability p" or "two judges each decide correctly with independent probabilities p", or "two judges decide the same way, which is correct with probability p"

[02:29:08] <PlanckWalk> It could also mean "two judges together decide correctly with probability p, otherwise *at least one* decide incorrectly but we don't know with what probability they both decide incorrectly"
[02:29:15] *** Joins: b93 (~I@a89-152-175-20.cpe.netcabo.pt)
[02:29:29] <learner36> yeah so the probability that the 3-panel and 1-panel judges decide correctly under a fair coin is the same
[02:29:30] <PlanckWalk> So it's rather ambiguous.

[02:35:10] <Oli> I am having fun pondering about the proposal, an user named as qergle, proposed here;  in my next message, is a quote of.
[02:35:16] <Oli> 19:28 < qergle> In the country of Probabilistan, a person charged with a crime has a choice of a single judge or a 3-judge panel. the single judge has probability p of deciding correctly. in the 3-judge panel, two judges decide correctly with probability p and the third just flips a coin (majority rules in 3-judge panel). Which setup would a guilty person pick?
[02:35:33] <PlanckWalk> (J1) Two judges always rule the same. The joint verdict is correct with probability p.  (J2) Two judges rule independently, each correct with probability p.  (J3) Two judges make rulings that may or may not be independent.  With probability p, both are correct.  (Otherwise one or both are incorrect)
[02:35:55] <PlanckWalk> Oli seems to be using interpretation J1.

A weaker thing than a derivative since the function does not need to be continuous in the short term, but that bounds its change over any "sufficiently large" finite interval

[12:25:34] <cherim> If you change f2 to f2(x) = (exp(-pi i (x+1)) + 1)/2 it will work maybe
[12:26:15] <cherim> But this is noticeably different from the basis exp(2pi i k x) now, if you keep the interval [0, 1]
[12:26:30] <cherim> Since exp(pi i x) has period 2, not 1
[12:28:02] <cherim> So you can't just borrow the rest from the previous basis. There are ways around this, by considering [-1, 1] and extending functions from [0, 1] to that interval by parity

[12:44:14] <cherim> It's not that simple. For starters, fix the sign in f2, you already have f1 and f2 not orthogonal
[12:44:32] <cherim> f0 and f1 in this notation
[12:45:13] <cherim> And then what you suggest is like sin^k(pi x). No way this will be orthogonal by simple tweaks

[13:25:57] <cherim> It is the situation that I described from the start: you actually consider the standard basis exp(i pi k x) on [-1, 1], but extend any function h(x) defined on [0, 1] to [-1, 1] by h(-x)=h(x)

[14:01:52] <damo22> i can probably rewrite my problem in terms of linear combination of the original basis vectors such that the new ones are just raised to the power k
[14:04:39] <damo22> then i will have some way to compute norms as truncated infinite sums
[14:07:10] <cherim> I don't see why you want powers. In the above case, powers corresponded to (cos(pi x))^k. Clearly cos^2 and cos^4 are not orthogonal.
[14:07:26] <cherim> cos(pi k x) are OK though.
[14:07:44] <cherim> There is also an issue which you probably don't pay enough attention to

[14:08:35] <cherim> Suppose somebody gives you a sequence of functions g0, g1, g2,... and says they are a complete orthonormal system for L2([0, 1]). What do you have to check to verify the claim?
[14:08:43] <Franciman> is there any cool book on the subject?

[14:11:27] <Franciman> speaking of which, being a complete orthonormal system does not imply being a basis for the space, right?
[14:11:29] <cherim> That's why I write all this "extend any function h(x) defined on [0, 1] to [-1, 1] by h(-x)=h(x) ... Then the standard theorems give you completeness" in the above case

[16:15:59] <Guest41> hey
[16:16:19] <Guest41> if I have three points on a plane, how does one calculate the area of a triangle given those points?
[16:16:33] <Guest41> the problem is that in the formula a=1/2bh I don't know the base
[16:16:39] <Guest41> because they're arbitrary points
[16:16:56] <Guest41> for the sake of assumption, however, please assume the points are colinear
[16:17:06] <xuxx> jmorris: i mean in my case you gain or lose a $ so it's a discrete variable
[16:17:52] <jmorris> correct
[16:18:35] <jmorris> Guest41: heron's formula
[16:18:39] <xuxx> jmorris: so E(G²) what can it be
[16:18:44] <jmorris> I just told you
[16:18:50] <jmorris> it's 1
[16:18:55] <xuxx> but why
[16:19:02] <jmorris> I told you why
[16:19:07] <xuxx> i lagged i haven't received your message
[16:19:26] <jmorris> you replied
[16:19:27] <jmorris> <jmorris> E(G^2) = \sum_{g \in G} x^2 P(G = g)
[16:19:27] <jmorris> <jmorris> in your case its (-1)^2 / 2 + (1)^2 / 2
[16:19:27] <jmorris> <jmorris> so 1
[16:19:27] <jmorris> <jmorris> then the variance is 1
[16:19:29] <xuxx> that's why i asked if u can copy paste again
[16:19:45] <Guest41> jmorris: thanks

[19:42:09] <Franciman> Sigma is inconsistent iff, for all formulas A , you get Sigma |- A
[19:42:23] <Franciman> [note this does not require the presence of \neg in your language]
[19:42:37] <cuppajoeman> Z-module: https://minerva.geneseo.edu/a-friendly-introduction-to-mathematical-logic/
[19:43:54] <Franciman> [ofc they coincide with your definition, because of the ex falso quodlibet rule, once you can prove absurdity, everything follows]
[19:44:20] *** Joins: econo (uid147250@user/econo)
[19:45:02] <Franciman> and when you can prove everything, you can also prove your formula :D
[19:45:30] <cuppajoeman> Ok - I'll keep reading the proof, I think it's hard to get on the first look over
[19:45:47] <Franciman> yes, it required like a lot of time for me to grasp it a little bit
[19:45:58] <Franciman> I don't remember all the details
[19:46:37] <Franciman> I remember it was important to get a maximal extension of Sigma

[19:46:49] <Franciman> so that you could define a model
[19:46:58] <Franciman> because in a model you can decide for each formula whether it is true or false
[19:47:09] <Franciman> so with a maximal extension S
[19:47:11] <Franciman> you can say
[19:47:14] <Franciman> A is true iff A \in S
[19:47:22] <Franciman> and it works ok
[19:47:48] <cuppajoeman> Ok I'll keep thinking on it
[19:47:55] <Franciman> then you wrap your formal system in a bag
[19:47:58] <Franciman> so nobody recognizes it
[19:48:03] <Franciman> and make a model out of it
[19:48:08] <Franciman> that's the part a bit strange lol

[19:48:54] <cuppajoeman> ok i will thx
[19:51:22] <cuppajoeman> How do we know a, and how do we get b from it? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/fRFFKyO9/image.png
[19:52:12] <cuppajoeman> Sorry here is more context: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/fPlWCSSv/image.png
[19:53:52] <cuppajoeman> If we know that Sigma |= phi, then how do we show Sigma U { ~ phi } |= (contradiction) ?
[19:54:13] <Franciman> this one is done semantically
[19:54:28] <Franciman> suppose you find a model in which Sigma is true
[19:54:32] <Franciman> and ~ phi is true
[19:54:33] <Z-module>   Sigma |= phi  means: for every model M of all of Sigma (some set of sentences,  phi is true in M too.  So  Sigma u (~phi)  has no model, because if ~phi is true in M, then phi is false in M.
[19:54:36] <Franciman> i.e. phi is false
[19:54:39] <Franciman> exactly
[19:55:26] <cuppajoeman> Wait can we go a little slower
[19:55:39] <Franciman> ok what does it mean that Sigma u { ~ phi } |= contradiction?
[19:55:57] <cuppajoeman> Sigma |= phi, means that for any L-Structure A we have that A |= Sigma implies that A |= phi Right?
[19:56:00] <Z-module>  note they used |-  (proves, syntactically) here, not  |=
[19:56:38] <Franciman> I think cuppajoeman is doing a previous step
[19:56:43] <Z-module> You can't really learn this material without *always* having strong mental distinction between |= and |-
[19:56:52] <cuppajoeman> I get the distinction
[19:56:56] <Franciman> because this thing also holds semantically
[19:56:58] <cuppajoeman> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/qlyQ7ITI/image.png
[19:57:08] <Franciman> you just have to tell us what you mean by Sigma u { ~phi } |= \bottom
[19:57:22] *** Joins: Koen (~Koen@61.192.201.77.rev.sfr.net)
[19:57:59] <cuppajoeman> It means that for any L-Structure A, if A |= Sigma U { ~phi }  then A |= \bottom
[19:58:20] <Franciman> and what does it mean that A |= \bottom ?
[19:58:32] <Z-module> (oh yes, I was only reading form the second line up there, sorry)
[19:58:40] *** Joins: join_subline (~join_subl@135-23-248-194.cpe.pppoe.ca)
[19:58:51] <Z-module> that means A has no model -- it is inconsistent
[19:59:18] <Franciman> so Sigma U { ~phi } has no model
[19:59:32] <cuppajoeman> It means that that [(forall x) x = x] ^  ~[(forall x) x= x] is true with respect to the L-structure A
[19:59:39] <Franciman> ok very well
[19:59:56] <Franciman> but this is impossible for any L-structure
[20:00:02] <Franciman> so it does not have any model
[20:00:21] <Franciman> no structure A is such that A |= \bottom
[20:00:31] <cuppajoeman> Why is there no L-structure that works?
[20:00:42] <Franciman> take a generic L-structure
[20:00:46] <Franciman> and interpret that formula in it
[20:00:51] <Franciman> you will inevitably get false
[20:00:58] <Franciman> you can't create an L-structure that makes that formula true
[20:01:05] <cuppajoeman> Ah, I see that
[20:01:10] <cuppajoeman> I agree with you
[20:01:16] <Franciman> (it's because it only uses logical symbols, so it is easy to check, basically it is because of the tarski semantics)
[20:01:31] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[20:01:47] <Franciman> now you get that
[20:01:52] <Franciman> if A is a model of Sigma
[20:01:59] <Franciman> [sorry if I forget the L-structure thing]
[20:02:05] <Franciman> it is also a model of \phi
[20:02:07] <Franciman> right?
[20:02:16] <cuppajoeman> One moment
[20:02:22] <Franciman> that's the hypothesis you gave
[20:02:34] <Franciman> A |= Sigma => A |= phi
[20:03:19] <cuppajoeman> Sigma U { ~phi }  means that for any L-Structure A, if A |= Sigma U { ~phi }  then A |= \bottom
[20:03:27] <Franciman> yes
[20:03:38] <cuppajoeman> And we showed that For any L-Structure A, A |= \bottom is impossible
[20:03:49] <Franciman> so it means that Sigma u { ~phi } has no model
[20:04:11] <cuppajoeman> Didn't we just show something like A -> F ?
[20:04:52] <Franciman> we showed that if A were a model of |= Sigma u { \phi }
[20:04:59] <Franciman> then you'd get something strange
[20:05:16] <Franciman> an absurd
[20:05:28] <Franciman> so A can't be a model of Sigma u { ~ phi }
[20:06:04] <Franciman> we indeed showd A -> absurd
[20:06:19] <Franciman> i.e. ¬A, but please be careful
[20:06:23] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so Sigma U {~ phi} |- \bottom means that Sigma U { ~phi} has no model
[20:06:27] <Franciman> yes
[20:06:30] <cuppajoeman> Ok\
[20:06:34] <Franciman> suppose it had a model A
[20:06:40] <Franciman> then A |= Sigma u { ~ phi }
[20:06:42] <Franciman> means
[20:06:45] <Franciman> A makes true all formulas of Sigma
[20:06:53] <Franciman> so
[20:06:55] <Franciman> A |= Sigma
[20:07:00] <Franciman> but this entails
[20:07:00] <cuppajoeman> certainly
[20:07:04] <Franciman> A |= phi
[20:07:06] <Franciman> so you have
[20:07:09] <Franciman> A |= phi
[20:07:13] <Franciman> and A |= ~ phi
[20:07:15] <Franciman> so you have
[20:07:20] <Franciman> A |= phi ^ ~ phi
[20:07:36] <Franciman> a postmodern version of your [forall x. x = x] and [forall x. x != x]
[20:07:56] <Franciman> it's impossible for a model to satisfy phi ^ ~phi
[20:08:34] <Franciman> cuppajoeman: in a nutshell can you see what's going on?
[20:08:38] *** Quits: Koen (~Koen@61.192.201.77.rev.sfr.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:08:39] <Franciman> if you can satisfy Sigma
[20:08:43] <Franciman> you must also satisfy phi
[20:08:49] <Franciman> but if you satisfy Sigma u { ~phi }
[20:08:58] <Franciman> you end up satisfying Sigma, hence phi, but also ~phi
[20:09:08] <cuppajoeman> Ok, yeah that's not good
[20:09:23] <cuppajoeman> So no L-structure works and thus it has no model?
[20:09:29] <Franciman> yes
[20:09:34] *** Parts: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) ()
[20:09:43] <Franciman> I think you could also directly prove that A |= your formula
[20:09:54] <Franciman> because it is entailed by phi ^ ~phi
[20:10:00] <Franciman> but I mean it is more work, I suppose

[20:10:34] <Franciman> well not so hard actually, but it requires we resort to tarski once more
[20:10:45] <Franciman> we know that when P -> Q
[20:10:47] <Franciman> is true when P is false

[22:29:41] <isekaijin> Let (R,m) be a local ring, and S its m-adic completion. Then the formal scheme Spf(S) is quite different from Spec(S), not just as a ringed space, but also even in its raw topology. Is there some way to enlarge the category of rings so that Spf(S) is just an ordinary spectrum of a “ring in the extended sense”?
[22:30:23] <learner36> how do you publish to the journal?
