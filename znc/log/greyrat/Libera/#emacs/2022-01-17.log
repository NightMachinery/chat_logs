[01:20:27] <wickedjargon> When I hit `C-h i`. I get a menu of all info manuals. When I hit `enter` on a manual, how do I return to the menu of info manuals? 
[01:22:09] <wickedjargon> nevermind, I found `info-up`. I was using evil-collection and it changed my keybindings.

[03:53:37] <twb> technomancy[m]: it's just that Debian has a tradition of not going "you're on your fucking own"

[06:15:51] <hodapp_> isn't that.... kinda every measure?
[06:15:59] <edrx> (I just downloaded the score sheet from IMSLP)

[17:40:01] <contrapunctus> ah,

[18:41:57] <rpav> what do you have as a project root?
[18:42:02] <rpav> like, what determines your project root
[18:42:57] <SAL9000> currently it's .git (we used to use Perforce, in the Bad Old Days...) but we're using multiple git repos; so, depending on which repo, I want to actually pretend that one level up is the project
[18:43:10] <SAL9000> thus allowing searching in a subset, or in everything
[18:43:19] *** Joins: blaub (~blaub@194-208-201-025.tele.net)
[18:43:34] <rpav> but you _can't_ just add a .project-root locally that you ignore?
[18:43:49] <SAL9000> I can, but I want to minimize littering
[18:43:51] <rpav> (and not necessarily .gitignore)
[18:44:00] <SAL9000> Yeah, I'm aware of .git/info/ignore or whatever it was
[18:44:01] <rpav> sure
[18:44:14] <SAL9000> tbh given how much hacking up of projectile I'm doing, I should probably write my own solution instead :-P
[18:44:35] <rpav> the problem with non-single-file solutions is that they're never actually deterministic of the project-root afaict
[18:44:56] <SAL9000> the authoritative source on project root data (in this case) is certain environment variables
[18:44:56] <rpav> potentially you can actually find the git-root for real these days but i still have a script to do that
[18:45:20] <rpav> but do those variables exist in emacs?

[18:52:47] <rpav> also like if there are other useful functionality to add, i use it all the time and would definitely not mind suggestions or PRs myself ;) i just want to avoid "smart" / "do what i think you want"

[18:53:43] <SAL9000> seems that all it needs is `(projectile-project-p)` which returns the project root, and `(projectile-project-name)` which is obvious :)
[18:54:22] <rpav> yeah then you have to manage what projects exist, and then doing project-find-file i find extremely useful, then you have to deal with ignored/staged/etc .. basically the few things beam does

[19:42:07] <SAL9000> fwef: in which major-mode? TAB behavior is often customized by major-modes.
[19:42:47] <fwef> SAL9000: I'd like this behaviour in all major modes.
[19:44:59] <bkhl> I guess you'd have to add a binding to the fundamental mode map to override every major mode?
[19:45:14] <SAL9000> You could bind TAB to self-insert-command using your preferred method, in such a way that it overrides all other bindings? e.g. `(bind-key* "TAB" 'self-insert-command)`. Note that this is likely to break things where TAB is used for things other than indentation, though...

[19:49:39] <SAL9000> yeah but if you don't want TAB to be an indentation key at all then that's a job for rebinding?
[19:49:50] <bkhl> Since other modes than that, you probably don't want to override their behaviour anyway.
[19:50:07] <SAL9000> good point -- define your own minor-mode which does the override, then enable that minor mode in text-mode-hook/prog-mode-hook

[22:38:33] <dpk> in other words, my minor mode only makes sense to activate in a buffer if conditions x, y, and z are met. so i have (if (and x y z) ... something to fail setting the minor mode ...)
