[21:04:54] <mrbitcoin> Dorsey, you know what I will do to Gladstein? Murder him, scam artist neocon fascist shit. Just wait and see what happens when I open the Bitcoin Forum I'm working on, HTTPS://BITCOIN.FORUM I will attack this IRC and BitcoinTalk.org for covering up massacres in Bolivia and Venezuela and backing terrorist while censoring me.

I was attacked multiple times by Bitcoin Core Developers who get paid by Gladstein and Mendoza
[21:14:49] <mrbitcoin> time to wake the fuck up my friends, the Bitcoin Forum is AI powered, uncensorable platform where I will run topics about what ties Bitcoin Core Developers and this IRC channel has to literal terrorists, just wait and see what I will publish about a few mfuckers like Peter McCormack, Jack Dorsey and others who have ties to Gladstein and Juan Guido
[21:18:06] <plankers> i mean this is high quality nonsense
[21:18:16] <plankers> gotta give credit where its due
[21:18:18] <mrbitcoin> I careted the Bitcoin Forum for one simple reason, to avoid censorship on this IRC and the theymos run scam site bitcointalk.org when I talk about Gladstein and his organization which are well known scammer, scamming for Bitcoin since March of 2019. You can censor me on this channel and on BitcoinTalk but the truth can't be hidden buddy.

The fucking Peter Mc>Cormack even travelled to Venezuela
[21:21:53] <mrbitcoin> to meet with Juan Guaido because Guido is working to overthorw the Venezuelan government with Leopoldo Lopez Mendoza, who ba accident is the cosuin of Thor Halvorssen Mendoza the boss of Gladstein

[21:46:05] <mrbitcoin> Cuba, massacring people in Bolivia. Let me telly ou something what you don't know, Gladstein laundered more than 12 MILLION dollars in 2019 alone when he started his Bitcoin Scam. The guy popped up from nothing, published few podcasts and propaganda online and now even here some users celebrate him as some Bitcoiner but in reality he is a terrorist scammer has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin nor with Human Rights for that
[21:46:07] <mrbitcoin> matter. In Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia and even in Belarus and Hong Kong Gladstein is well know by people but not because of Bitcoin. Time to clear up some shit people. Do you even remember Bitcoin 21 which was organized in Miami? Guess what Gladstein and his "ngo" funded the whole event and in October also in Miami there will be an "Oslo Freedom Forum" on the same place where Bitcoin 21 was organized. Jack Dorsey is directly working
[21:46:12] <mrbitcoin> with terrorists and I going to destroy him too. Tweet to @jack and ask him about Thor Halvorssen Mendoza, and Gladstein, he will freak out when you say my name to him.

I only sell the domain if I get that 600+ Bitcoin bounty he offered. My forum has Artificial Intelligence deployed to check toxicity and spam, and on my forum by default everyone has encrypted direct messages
[23:06:33] <mrbitcoin> enabled (based on BIP-39). Do you remember that theymos prmoised to dox Satoshi Nakamoto by releasing his private messages? I'm not interested in what users sending to other users privately and on my forum casino and other scams also not getting advertised. Also because of the issue with Bitcoin Wiki, I allow users to turn any post into a wiki. While I don't want my forum to become a place for doxing, some people like Jack Dorsey,
[23:06:33] <mrbitcoin> Peter McCormack, Gladstein and a few other can expect that they going to see themselves on the forum being doxed, I doing so not because they attacks against me, but because the Bitcoin community deserve to know who are these people.
