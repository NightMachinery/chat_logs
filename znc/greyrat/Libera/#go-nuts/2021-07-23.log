[00:22:02] <mickey> any idea how can i use something like \x12\x34 in a string literal?
[00:23:10] <ikke> mickey: what do you mean?
[00:23:22] <ikke> fmt.Println("\x12\x34")
[00:23:28] <fizzie> "Like that."
[00:23:48] <mickey> i mean that i have a large template and i want an emoji in.
[00:25:02] <ikke> and?
[00:25:55] <fizzie> A Unicode escape (\u1234, or \U12345678) might be more pleasant for that than adding UTF-8 bytes with \x12, but either should do in a string literal.
[00:26:17] <foobaz> only in "" literals, right? it won't work in '' or `` literals
[00:26:17] <fizzie> (Maybe this is a *raw* string literal though?)
[00:26:59] <foobaz> if it's a '' or `` literal, paste the emoji itself into the literal, no need to encode it with escape sequences
[00:27:15] <fizzie> '' is a rune literal, and you can use escapes in them (but they're just one rune).
[00:27:36] <foobaz> oh right sorry, i get confused with C sometimes
[00:27:39] <mickey> maybe i misused the terminology. i meant ``
[00:27:56] <foobaz> or python maybe
[00:27:56] <fizzie> Yeah, that's a raw string literal specifically.
[00:28:13] <mickey> right. so that.
[00:28:21] <fizzie> Embedding the character as-is is probably the path of least resistance.
[00:28:23] <foobaz> paste the emoji into your go source
[00:28:45] <foobaz> the go compiler has no problem with unicode, it's guaranteed to take it
[00:29:22] <fizzie> If you don't want that, then `...`+"\u1234"+`...` can be an option, but not a pretty one.

[15:26:49] <fizzie> Not entirely clear to me why doing it like that would be preferrable to using time.Ticker directly. Yes, it will "adjust the time interval or drop ticks to make up for slow receivers", but what would you *want* it to do if your task takes longer than the interval? Start several copies? That'd be just a matter of making the receiver fast, by starting the actual task in a separate goroutine.

[15:28:36] <ikke> Depends on how flexible you want the scheduler to be
[15:28:55] <ikke> if you only have tasks that run every 5 minutes, then using it with a duration of 5 minutes probably suffices
[15:33:35] <fizzie> Well, sure. But "schedule a task periodically" doesn't sound like it'd necessarily require a lot of flexibility. If you do want a single scheduler for a bunch of tasks with different schedules, I feel like the classic model would be something with a priority queue so that it can wait until the next scheduled task instead of polling at a fixed interval. Not that I imagine either couldn't work fine
[15:33:37] <fizzie> in practice.
[15:34:02] <fizzie> I think someone was here a while back using something called "gocron", which did cron-style job specifications.

[15:38:09] <ikke> I'm not sure if ticker suffers from drift in the long run
[15:39:48] <ikke> ie, if it's 5 minutes late every 10h, then after 4 'ticks' it could already be passed your 20 minute margin

[20:53:50] <lungaro> i always see tons of tools around headless chrome/chromium -- i bet google can give you a dozen =P
[20:54:30] <lungaro> are they all based on selenium tho?
[20:54:32] <Tv_> andlabs: the interface is called "Web Driver". selenium dates from an era before it existed, and has horrible legacy kludges because of that.

[20:57:51] <Tv_> andlabs: i've used https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/rsc/webdriver ... it's pretty much abandoned, but it's not horrible code like most of the herpderp webdev ones are.
[20:58:20] <Tv_> there was another one that didn't stink too much, but i can't find the url right now
[20:59:02] <Tv_> or maybe it was bitbucket.org/tebeka/selenium and it did smell, but it was the least-bad of the alternatives?
[20:59:16] <andlabs> ah
[20:59:21] <andlabs> no that one requires java
[20:59:31] <Tv_> anyway, these days remote controlling a browser is a relatively simple json protocol
[20:59:31] <andlabs> and I see that webdrivers all require the borwser to be actually installed as well ugh
[20:59:48] <andlabs> was kinda hoping for a simple go get and you're good to go solution but
[20:59:49] <andlabs> ugh antiscrapers
[20:59:52] <Tv_> andlabs: people are just stupid and keep calling things "selenium" far past the original hack that was called selenium
[21:00:14] <Tv_> andlabs: like, for some people, the concept of "browser-based testing" is pronounced "selenium". shrug and move on
[21:00:24] <Tv_> andlabs: the rsc one works fine
[21:00:51] <Tv_> andlabs: and also there's a lower-level (not standard across browsers) chrome debugging api that lets you control tabs etc
[21:00:53] <andlabs> yes I get what you are saying =P I'm already on the next step
[21:00:57] *** Quits: Torr (~Torr@user/torr) (Quit: leaving)
[21:01:18] <andlabs> that is, a web driver binary that includes the browser, because again, I don't want to actually install anything
[21:01:20] <Tv_> (original selenium = inject javascript to page and attempt to remote control it through that)
[21:01:38] <andlabs> of course "standalone web driver" gives results for the selenium standalone server, because words can only ever have one meaning
[21:01:45] <Tv_> andlabs: "chromedriver" is the special build of chrome that has the protocol and does headless
[21:02:00] <andlabs> huh?
[21:02:03] <andlabs> 2021/07/23 12:28:41 An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary  (Driver info: chromedriver=91.0.4472.101 (af52a90bf87030dd1523486a1cd3ae25c5d76c9b-refs/branch-heads/4472@{#1462}),platform=Mac OS X 10.12.6 x86_64)
