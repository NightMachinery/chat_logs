[00:05:50] <Joel> also has a remote column
[00:06:17] <Joel> I've been remote for 8 years, never going back in an office. ever.
[00:29:08] <kwilczynski> :)

[01:38:26] <slaughter> I've got roughly a month til my last day
[01:38:41] <slaughter> I've already got a position mostly lined up and the full support of my org in finding a new one
[01:38:51] <slaughter> Plus, y'know, this market and whatnot
[01:39:09] <slaughter> I appreciate the kind words Joel and kwilczynski 
[01:39:35] <slaughter> The biggest bummer is that I've REALLY enjoyed this job
[01:39:56] <kwilczynski> ;)
[01:40:03] <kwilczynski> Company has issue?
[01:40:42] <Joel> kwilczynski they all do :)
[01:41:08] <slaughter> Truf
[01:41:15] <slaughter> Money, though. Not enough money to go around
[01:41:47] <kwilczynski> :(
[01:44:35] <slaughter> I'm likely coming out the other side with more than a 25% salary bump
[01:44:44] <slaughter> So turn that frown...upside...the other way
[01:46:54] <lantech19446> I hope it all works out for you slaughter 
[01:47:03] <slaughter> Thanks lantech19446 I think it will
[01:48:54] <Joel> I've never gotten less than five figure raises with every hop
[01:49:36] <Joel> devops/sre type roles
[02:04:09] <slaughter> Yeah I'm looking at ~35k increase

[02:20:44] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:21:45] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: I only make 750,000
[02:21:59] <kwilczynski> I am so sorry!
[02:22:05] * kwilczynski hugs lantech19446 
[02:22:17] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I am sure 2022 will break even on 1mln+, keep going!
[02:22:21] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:23:11] <lantech19446> god I hope so I'm barely making ends meet at this salary
[02:23:42] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: We really need to get you a better job.
[02:24:21] <kwilczynski> Nobody should be in dire straits making only 750k.
[02:24:27] <kwilczynski> That is so not Bay Area.
[02:24:49] <kwilczynski> LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4ygwXzcl9E

[04:26:02] <Joel> kwilczynski what I make and what I live off of are very different numbers :)
[04:26:12] <Joel> I live a lavish life on $3,000 USD a month. I make far more.
[04:29:10] <Joel> I don't know about others, but there are plenty of people who make tons of money that are broke due to being money stupid.
[04:29:46] <Joel> https://www.shouldisplurge.com/ - I love sharing this out. Helps people understand the cost of a reoccurring monthly subscription. 
[04:30:03] <slaughter> $3k is my mortgage, but otherwise I can more or less fall in line with what you've said Joel 
[04:31:27] <kwilczynski> I am with you Joel :)
[04:31:33] <lantech19446> why can I not see what Joel said
[04:31:48] <slaughter> did you block him lantech19446 
[04:32:00] <lantech19446> i don't think so let me double check
[04:32:07] <lantech19446> oh wait is he the asshole from aws?
[04:33:13] <Joel> slaughter I bought in a medium cost of living in 2011, couldn't have asked for better timming. 1,500 sq ft less than $500/mo
[04:33:23] <lantech19446> yea he must be cuz i have him blocked
[04:33:44] <slaughter> That's criminal Joel 
[04:34:02] <Joel> slaughter right? I'm in a major metro, too *shrug*
[04:34:16] <Joel> to further rub salt in, two different companies offer fiber internet to my house.
[04:34:25] <Joel> 1gig/mo for $65 total.
[04:34:32] <slaughter> I bought last year in a HCOL area (I guess, though coming from Seattle it's laughably not HCOL). ~1300sq ft, 500k, $2800/mo
[04:34:48] <slaughter> ...are you in the PNW by chance/?
[04:35:30] <lantech19446> 500k would be cheap here a lot of our houses start at 600 or more
[04:35:43] <Joel> No, I'm not, have spent plenty of time there, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest is one of my happy places.
[04:36:32] <slaughter> lantech19446 yeah in Seattle 500k wouldn't get me...anything. Down in Portland, it got us a decent place
[04:36:49] <slaughter> Joel check out North Cascades National Park next time you're in the area. Go see Lake Diablo. Thank me after
[04:36:58] <Joel> slaughter noted, thanks!
[04:37:06] <lantech19446> lake diablo reminds me of a nirvana song
[04:37:13] <slaughter> https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5807/30524716993_296de74d10_z.jpg
[04:37:17] <slaughter> That doesn't do it justice in any way
[04:37:32] <Joel> gonna be retired in a couple years, one of many options is rv life to check all of this out while young enough to enjoy it
[04:37:55] <lantech19446> slaughter: quite possibly the only place i've seen so far that competes with that is blue lagoon
[04:38:15] <slaughter> In Iceland?
[04:38:24] <lantech19446> yea
[04:38:26] <slaughter> Joel why are you living the life I want? Can I have a little slice?
[04:38:33] <slaughter> Iceland is unfair competition
[04:38:52] <lantech19446> iceland is pure beauty in every manner from the land to the women I'll live there some day
[04:40:10] <slaughter> Well, time to get pizza. And continue writing this new chunk of resume if I still can after the beer that accompanies the pizza
[04:40:44] <lantech19446> have a good night slaughter
