[00:00:25] <kuudes> a lot of it comes from the humans
[00:01:30] <rsaarelm> Right, tricky. How did this go again, can we just burn all the humans or did that mess the goals somehow? I know there's some complexity here I keep forgetting.
[00:05:16] <rsaarelm> Blah blah humans need oxygen, humans want active gamma ray sources pointed away from them, humans disintegrate when subjected to extreme g-forces, humans have "bones" that prevent them from being contained in a topologically elegant way.
[00:06:38] <galambo_> it just occured to me the irony that the arabic name 'saad' means 'happiness' in arabic

[01:03:19] <feepbot> How factories were made safe (The fundamental cause was a wrong attitude towards the core question: who is responsible for safety?)
[01:05:13] <galambo_> hi
[01:05:19] <kuudes> hi
[01:05:58] <galambo_> I keep reiterating this: I wish all industries/sectors adopted the airline approach to safety
[01:06:13] <kuudes> which is?
[01:06:18] <galambo_> I wish in medicine we adopted a similar system to airlines. like checklists for everything.
[01:06:27] <galambo_> if something goes wrong
[01:06:29] <kuudes> ah, ok
[01:06:43] <galambo_> they dont just blame someone
[01:06:49] <kuudes> though airlines can afford to stay on ground if something fails in checklist
[01:06:50] <galambo_> like they do
[01:07:16] <galambo_> they should do a big investigation and figure out what went wrong and how to fix all deficiencies that could have led this adverse outcome to happen
[01:07:31] <galambo_> so it never happens again in the future
[01:07:44] <galambo_> kuudes, well airlines can have emergencies in the air
[01:07:47] <galambo_> planes*
[01:07:59] <galambo_> the checklist manifesto talked about this
[01:08:06] <kuudes> yes, but then they don't run checklists, or do they?
[01:08:09] <galambo_> by atul gawande or whatever his name is
[01:08:12] <galambo_> they do
[01:08:41] <galambo_> they have a book and they open the book when something goes wrong and follow the instructions

[01:10:46] <kuudes> galambo_, on friday I learned that any doctor can prescribe extra covid vaccine doses off label
[01:10:47] <galambo_> airway breathing circulation disability exposure. we go through each step when assessing a patient. there is no point in assessing the breathing if the airway is blocked for example. and we also have an algorithm for advanced life support etc. so we do have algorithms and checklists and standard operating procedures. but I wish they were more systemized
[01:11:02] <galambo_> kuudes, I didnt know that :D
[01:11:11] <kuudes> in whole of eu and usa at least
[01:11:21] <kuudes> also regardless of patient age
[01:11:35] <kuudes> so you can order vaccines to whomever you want, also 3rd and Nth doses
[01:11:58] <kuudes> I am currently hunting for a doctor to prescribe me 3rd dose :-p
[01:12:27] * gwern is grimly amused that not only has the mini-starbucks at the gym not reopened, there's not even any restocking of the equipment or a sign hinting at reopening at any time in the future. yeah, starbucks knows it can't even staff its main fulltime locations, the marginal little ones aren't coming back anytime soon
[01:12:30] <kuudes> I guess tomorrow some of them may check to learn more about that
[01:12:48] <kuudes> but I expect next week might soon get disorderly as this runs more in the public
[01:13:17] <galambo_> kuudes, I used to abuse my powers as a doctor when I was in the army. when I was in bootcamp I would give all the conscripts sick notes like candy. they all loved me. I would definitely consider giving vaccine prescriptions to anyone who asks for them if I was a gp (as long as there are no contraindications of course)
[01:13:47] <kuudes> sadly I am not sure if UK prescriptions are still honored in eu. without brexit it would have been a nobrainer
[01:14:06] *** Quits: walterwhip (~walterwhi@user/walterwhip) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:14:10] <kuudes> all eu prescriptions are eu prescriptions and therefore valid in all of eu
[01:14:46] <kuudes> but thanks!
[01:15:10] <galambo_> gwern, I am increasingly starting to realise that the job of a barista has been replaced by machines. even coffee enthusiasts admit that nespresso is better than most coffee in shops. and then we have this cold brew coffee in the supermarkets.
[01:16:02] <kuudes> I have wondered why baristas have existed in the first place given everyone here has their own coffee machine at home etc...
[01:16:37] <galambo_> (I know I mentioned this before) also cooking. have you seen how microwave meals are manufactured in factory lines by machines? who would want to cook after seeing those machines efficiently cook large batches and make nice cheap ready meals. so restaurants and home cooking are already obsolete 
[01:16:51] <kuudes> yes
[01:16:56] <kuudes> I like my microwave meals
[01:17:06] <kuudes> they are also more healthy on average afaik than home made
[01:17:23] <kuudes> as they have lower fat and salt than people set themselves
[01:17:53] <galambo_> kuudes, yes because they have to advertise the calories on the packaging. so they cannot get away with putting in too much salt or butter
[01:18:08] <kuudes> yes
[01:18:56] <kuudes> "slow food" restaurants are the unhealthiest, ie most fat and salt, it was found by a magazine over here, as they have to optimize for taste
[01:19:11] <kuudes> mcdonalds is not very unhealthy over here :-/
[01:19:31] <galambo_> yes! since I started counting calories I have become wary of restaurants that dont advertise their calories
[01:19:33] <kuudes> one thing I miss from before covid is workplace lunchery salad meals
[01:20:02] <Dyo> there's more to food than salt and fat
[01:20:06] <kuudes> they are the only places which have high enough hygience for salad bars, as they can afford to throw the extra to trash at the end of the day
[01:20:11] <gwern> Dyo: no there's not
[01:20:41] <kuudes> and they have some sort of tax obligations I think for the nutrition values of supposed "average meals"
[01:21:10] <kuudes> which means for me, who likes fresh salad meals, I guess I get some sort of indirect tax subsidy in food quality when eating those :D
[01:21:13] <galambo_> actually I like to add msg/salt to my food. do you guys think thats too unhealthy? I mean its just some extra salt and protein
[01:21:30] <Betawolf> really depends what the rest of your food is.
[01:21:38] <kuudes> I have nothing against msg but I have learned as prior that salt -> heart diseases
[01:21:47] <kuudes> and that on average we should still get less salt
[01:22:07] <galambo_> kuudes, maybe I should try potassium salt instead
[01:22:29] <kuudes> personally I am for all those E-code stuff. usually anything that passes EU food muster is not poisoneous, and they allow for much lower amount of preservatives
[01:22:35] <kuudes> so the salt is only to taste anymore
[01:23:00] <kuudes> something like 1:10000 relative to salt weight in effectiveness
[01:23:18] <galambo_> there are lots of obsolete jobs out there but people dont realise
[01:23:19] <kuudes> best and most boring cyberpunk science is food preservation
[01:23:37] <galambo_> for example banking. defi has made banking obsolete
[01:23:49] <galambo_> kuudes, yes canning is underrated
[01:23:50] <dv^_^> lol
[01:24:09] <kuudes> well, finland uses some billions of euros of indirect support (loan guarantees) to have ship construction to happen here
[01:24:28] <kuudes> I would like us to use at least similar size thing to subsidy mrna vaccine production in finland
[01:24:32] <gwern> galambo_: caning is underrated too
[01:24:39] <Betawolf> does defi replace banking in the same way microwave meals replace all food?
[01:24:41] <kuudes> currently we subsidize making ships for caribbean cruises
[01:25:02] <kuudes> gwern, >:-I
[01:26:03] <kuudes> galambo_, during the pandemic I have appreciated the effectiveness gain of digital chat doctors
[01:26:31] <kuudes> I presume they can keep open multiple chat windows to us patients and just press buttons on "order a covid test" "order sick leave, 2 days" etc
[01:26:51] <galambo_> Betawolf, I dont know. but you can be a liquidity provider in defi if you want to. its very easy to set up. and you will then act like a bank or exchange for random people in the internet.  I dont know if this will scale. but the technology is there and once you try it you have one of those 'broke out of the matrix' moments
[01:26:52] <kuudes> and the chatbot asks the checklists for the symptoms
[01:27:28] <kuudes> how do you know good lenders from bad?
[01:29:09] <galambo_> kuudes, I dont know too much about the inner workings. the thing I know is being a liquidity provider between two different currencies. you gain fees from  the transactions but you risk something called 'impermanent loss' if the price between the two assets moves too much
[01:29:29] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[01:29:35] <galambo_> there is borrowing and lending on defi and it seems to work but I dont know how
[01:29:41] <kuudes> that feels like MLM scheme
[01:29:42] <galambo_> I think you use collateral
[01:29:45] <kuudes> .wp wincapita
[01:29:47] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinCapita WinCapita, previously WinClub and GiiClub, was a Finnish Internet-based Ponzi scheme that advertised itself as a private investment club engaged in currency trading. In reality, it was a bucket shop like many other foreign exchange fraud schemes.

[01:31:37] <galambo_> kuudes, it is definitely not a ponzi scheme. it is a trustless protocol and its inner workings are public. it does have the risk of impermanent loss so its not safe.
[01:31:50] <galambo_> anyways this is more suited to #lw-bitcoin
[01:35:49] <galambo_> basically being a liquidity provider is a bet on the belief that the prices will remain stable. a bet that prices will be less volatile than people anticipate. if prices deviate too much then you will wind up with more of the asset being sold and less of the asset that people are buying and driving the price up of.

[01:52:05] <galambo_> I just find it mindblowing that any random person could act like a bank or exchange. it is a risky endeavour. there is no free lunch. but I find it fascinating that such a thing is possible in the first place. we dont need bankers anymore. bankers are obsolete. anybody can be a banker.

[03:20:51] <gwern> I think early on I did notice a bit of additional mucus/phlegm freed up, and a slight stimulant effect, but the appetite suppression works well at low doses
[03:21:35] <gwern> getting it is easy enough. you just go to the pharmacy counter, ask for bronkaid/pimatene, they scan your driver's license, you sign some declaration 'i'm not a speed manufacturer, honest', and pay
[03:22:02] <RiversHaveWings> yeah it can be used to make meth
[03:22:07] <RiversHaveWings> same as pseudoephedrine
[03:22:21] <gwern> I do it once a month on my shopping trips. just stop in at a CVS. last time they were out so I went to a CVS inside a target. surprisingly, it was actually slightly cheaper than the standalone CVS. not sure what's up with that, the price never changes

[05:54:11] <feepbot> <gwern> 'One final thing to know about Akin Fernandez: He's prone to fixations. His first was a collection of Marvel comic books that swelled to 5,000 when he was a kid. In his twenties, he noticed that literary-minded prostitutes in London were advertising their services, and phone numbers, with saucy little poems written on cards glued to the insides of phone booths. ("Once upon
[05:54:11] <feepbot> a time in Earl's Court / reigned the wicked Love Queen . . . ") For months, Fernandez would mortify friends and family by painstakingly peeling the cards off the glass, until he owned more than 600 of them. In 1984, he published the lot in a volume called "The X Directory." "My mother came to the book party," Fernandez recalls. "I couldn't believe it."'

[06:12:57] <catern> oh, to be clear I would need to move (for a year or so) to get a master's at a good institution
[06:13:21] <catern> the universities around here, *sniff*, they just aren't up to my standards
[06:13:36] <quanticle> You're really selling your case
[06:14:28] <quanticle> Look, at this point, I would respect you more if you pulled a spxtr and said, "Okay, screw this, I like <subject> and I'm going to give up my job at Google, take a vow of poverty and get a PhD in it"
[06:14:51] <catern> no a PhD is too much work and sacrifices too much money
[06:15:05] <rmmh> it's unclear that spxtr even really took a vow of poverty, he's pretty thrifty
[06:15:06] <quanticle> Right, so you're getting a milquetoast PhD
[06:15:29] <catern> oh, another factor is that the opportunity cost is low for me, because in finance you have to take a year off between jobs anyway due to noncompetes
[06:15:29] <quanticle> rmmh: Okay, well, let's put it this way: taking the vow of poverty was pretty easy for him
[06:16:11] <quanticle> catern: You could move to California, where noncompetes are nonenforceable
[06:16:17] <catern> so the cost really is just the sticker price, minimal extra opportunity cost (since I can't work during that year anyway)
[06:18:03] <quanticle> Okay, but that perplexes me even more. If you can spend all day reading research papers, textbooks and doing homework problems and you don't need the sheepskin... then why are you signing up for something like a 30,000 payment?
[06:20:17] <catern> like I said, I think the university course formula is actually beneficial; being able to ask the professor and TAs questions, going through course with a bunch of peers, collaborating and discussing with them, etc
[06:21:01] <catern> at least I find the ability to discuss things with experts, very helpful for understanding
[06:23:18] <quanticle> Right, but what I'm asking is, are you not able to take those courses without signing up for a degree?
[06:23:38] <quanticle> Like does the university say that if you want to sit this course, you have to be in a degree program?
[06:24:19] <quanticle> gwern: https://i.imgur.com/axhV5iq.png Oolong is my "staff favorite oolong"
[06:24:43] <catern> I guess I could theoretically move to Pittsburgh and then enroll in some courses without signing up for the master's program, but I believe there's a maximum you can take per semester without being enrolled (and I think that max is 1)
[06:24:51] <gwern> the nz oolong was decent imo

[06:27:14] <Rubba> you can scope out the institutions you would otherwise be attending for grad students to hire
[06:27:49] <catern> do you have any suggestions on how to do that? I haven't had much success so far
[06:27:49] <adiabatty> Maybe it'll sound less bad if you re-frame your expectations as "find a study buddy"

[06:28:37] <Rubba> never done it myself. but if i was going to, i'd probably email a professor for a course i'm interested in and ask if he can recommend any desperate yet capable students
[06:28:42] <adiabatty> well, if you _can_ do that, do. but if you can't, and can only get people who barely know a bit more htan you do…

[06:39:07] <catern> Rubba: still! that approach requires a lot more effort than just signing up for a degree

[06:39:34] <adiabatty> don't degrees come with a lot more time garbage, though
[06:39:57] <catern> this is rational laziness (ignorance?) on my part I think
[06:40:20] <Rubba> pretty sure conversing with some professors via email would be less work than preparing all the paperwork for applying to a master's program
[06:41:06] <Rubba> unless you're referring to designing a curriculum for self-study
[06:41:17] <catern> Rubba: but then I have to hunt down a specific student, and pay them, and work with them to figure out what to study, and make sure I stick within things they know...

[06:49:48] <adiabatty> at math camp you'll make nerdy friends
[06:52:35] <Rubba> catern: if your goal is to sufficiently master knowledge X in the fatest time possible, then i think the best path (for someone who is capable of knowing when they don't understand something) is to try and read a textbook or do a practice exam, and recursively go learn the things you don't understand. if you're more in it for the social experience, then yeah academia gives you the best of

[08:04:59] <catern> otoburb: quanticle: people who would learn more from a year of autodidacticism than a year of being taught by experts are rare, if you think you're in that class you're probably wrong
[08:05:22] <catern> I don't care about the credntial

[08:06:15] <quanticle> You already have one
[08:06:31] <gwern> maybe as a youngster, but you're old enough to be an independent learner. how do you think any researcher or industry figure or whatever learns stuff? you don't take off every couple years to earn another master's degree...
[08:08:15] <catern> gwern: "how do you think any researcher or industry figure or whatever learns stuff?" typically they don't
[08:10:27] <quanticle> Except, that's false? Like, people do learn stuff. 
[08:10:51] <quanticle> I don't understand why you have this mindset that the only way to learn is to be surrounded by experts
[08:11:26] <quanticle> Like, I'm reading about international relations theory right now, so that I can better understand some bits of foreign policy analysis
[08:11:47] <catern> quanticle: "I don't understand why you have this mindset that the only way to learn is to be surrounded by experts" nice strawman, I never said anything close to that
[08:12:08] <quanticle> Except you sort of just did: "typically they don't"
[08:12:10] <quanticle> That's wrong
[08:12:20] <quanticle> People learn stuff all the time, without going to school
[08:14:33] <catern> the context wasn't "intellectual dilettante learning about random field at a surface level", the context was researchers and industry figures, i.e. people who already know a lot about a subject area; do they spend time learning new techniques or do they just apply the ones they already know?
[08:15:05] <gwern> they're not going back for master's degrees everytime they need to know new things, that's for sure
[08:16:20] <catern> gwern: sure, I think a better explanation for that is "they don't need to know new things often, and don't learn them deeply when they do", not "they've rationally chosen autodidacticism as the most efficient way to learn about a new subject area"
[08:17:08] <quanticle> And furthermore, in your context, you're not a "researcher or industry figure", you *are* an intellectual dilletante in this context. You're not getting master's in finance or economics, you're getting one to study like type theory or something.
[08:18:19] <quanticle> It's not as if your goal is then to get a job at Google or Microsoft designing new programming languages.
[08:19:16] <catern> gwern: also I think researchers and industry figures probably run into the same issue I mentioned before: the more advanced and obscure the topic area, the harder to find experts who will teach you - so the more you need to do autodidacticism - that might be the most important part of this, actually

[08:31:50] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Between 1998 and 2015, Her Interactive published thirty-two flagship Nancy Drew games for the PC, as well as a handful of games for other platforms. The company’s incredible output was the result of a production schedule that pushed out two new games each year. Like clockwork, the studio would release one game in the summer and the other right before the holiday season.
[08:31:50] <feepbot> “The fact that we could knock these games out every six months still blows my mind,” said one former employee. “We had a schedule, and once you get the deadlines understood… It’s incredible what we were able to produce.” Despite the demanding schedule, Her Interactive never grew beyond a single office...Fans developed the same kind of attachment to the Nancy Drew games.
[08:31:50] <feepbot> When each new mystery came out, hardcore fans would rush to big-box stores so that they could complete their jewel case collection. The fans, who dubbed themselves the Clue Crew, investigated every corner of every game, mailed fan art to Her Interactive’s office, and volleyed posts back and forth for hours on Her Interactive’s online forums. Outside of Her Interactive, the game
[08:31:55] <feepbot> industry was changing dramatically. But from 1999 until 2015, Her Interactive’s formula stayed the same: Nancy as unseen player character, voiced by the same actress, inhabiting aesthetically similar worlds, solving two mysteries a year, never aging. For a long time, it seemed like Her Interactive was somehow immune to the risks that had tanked so many other video game studios.
[08:31:55] <feepbot> Then things changed...Gaiser had established Her Interactive’s reputation and production schedule, but even she hadn’t been able to successfully adapt the Nancy Drew games to the next big platform: mobile.' https://kotaku.com/the-case-of-the-disappearing-nancy-drew-video-games-1830256040

[12:24:39] <CoJaBo> I don't think they're able to determine when this happens, but they do realize we're catching them now, because they're making huge numbers of new accounts, and changing up their listings a lot more than they used to
[12:25:38] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, why wouldn't they be able to realize? Register account, browse public listings, see if scam post is among them.

[12:35:34] * feep pops into the conversation
[12:35:38] <feep> that's a good sentence, I like that sentence
[12:36:07] <Gurkenglas> When an established user makes a query with a 100 results of which 10 are scams... that's a *lot* of bits of evidence for the scammers, so you have to make the results probabilistic
[12:37:38] <Gurkenglas> It may or may not turn out that the problem is not efficiently solvable, in which case you could still use heuristics until the scammers figure all of them out.
[12:38:06] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: The scammers aren't even that sophisticated; they'd do stuff like using an account specifically to view their scam posts
[12:38:26] <CoJaBo> They don't even try to do that anymore, so it's a dead end anyway
[12:38:30] <Gurkenglas> In which case different ways to go about implementation would make a difference to how long it lasts...
[12:39:18] <Gurkenglas> If you publicly explain the math behind your decisions, which you might want to for, say, probablistic queries, it'd point them right at what they need to think about
[12:40:01] <CoJaBo> The basis of this idea seemed sound. If it actually worked, they wouldn't be able to evade it without completely changing up how they do this scam
[12:40:43] <Gurkenglas> Yeah the current line of inquiry is about whether one can hide whether they have succeeded from them.
[12:41:24] <CoJaBo> We've hidden that well enough that they've stopped trying to check if they've succeeded, so there's that at least
[12:41:56] <Gurkenglas> Or they switched to using a method that you haven't figured out.
[12:42:32] <Gurkenglas> You don't need to tarpit their secondary accounts - let them visit the scam page, let them make comments, maybe put them on a list.

[12:44:35] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, how often are users protected by the filter?
[12:44:57] <CoJaBo> The current filter catches about 95% of them
[12:45:20] <CoJaBo> The problem is, that still lets a ton thru now that they've ramped up posting
[12:45:29] <Gurkenglas> Not what I meant: In the course of their daily usage, how often does a regular user see something that was censored by your system?
[12:45:53] <CoJaBo> I mean, if it's censored, they don't see it at all lol
[12:45:53] <Gurkenglas> or rather, not see something :)
[12:46:09] <Gurkenglas> how often does your system intervene on a regular user's browsing
[12:48:17] <Gurkenglas> Why do I ask? Because if regular users see/not-see scam posts all the time, a scammer can just do what a regular user would do, note down what scam posts it happens to see, and gather loads of training data for their generator that way
[12:48:37] <PapuaHardyNet> so they'll use an AI to generate scam posts?
[12:48:42] <PapuaHardyNet> GAN with extra steps
[12:48:45] <CoJaBo> lol
[12:49:05] <Gurkenglas> Exactly. You're giving them your discriminator for free, if the user patterns are as I fear :)
[12:49:08] <CoJaBo> I'm almost 100% certain these are hand-typed by a small handful of real people
[12:50:01] <CoJaBo> The scammers have odd quirks that make it clear they are using low-tech but brute-force methods
[12:50:30] <Gurkenglas> And if there's one of them that's smarter than the rest he'll rise to the top as soon as your plan succeeds

[13:03:02] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, or do you mean, you extract fields from a database and then send their content to the AI? What is in those fields, then? The html content of the listing?

[13:09:16] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: More like, "This item is 100 doll hairs, and we deliver to Virgina"
[13:09:53] <CoJaBo> The extraction AI needs to identify that as a product, that costs $100, and will ship to the US state of VA
[13:10:46] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, can you personally tell whether a post looks like a scam?
[13:11:10] <CoJaBo> Yes
[13:11:24] <CoJaBo> They aren't very good at disguising them at all
[13:13:06] <Gurkenglas> Suppose you were to write a giant list of banned words. Would that work well enough?
[13:14:21] <CoJaBo> There's no specific words that are unique to the spam post
[13:14:41] <CoJaBo> I've tried all the simple approaches already lol
[13:14:47] <Gurkenglas> How do you tell whether a post looks like a scam?
[13:14:51] <Gurkenglas> Manually.
[13:15:19] <CoJaBo> It offers something that isn't reasonable
[13:15:22] <rsaarelm> Lookin'
[13:15:42] *** Joins: milanandreew (uid500468@user/milanandreew)
[13:16:17] <CoJaBo> E.g., lawnmower, new in box, sold for $1, available for pickup in all of the world's top 10 cities, but won't ship anywhere else.
[13:16:42] <PapuaHardyNet> rounds legit
[13:16:45] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, suppose people, upon first registering, have to buy something before they start selling things. Would that solve it?
[13:17:04] <CoJaBo> That's an extreme example obviously, but they're easy to spot by human eyes, and the lazier ones can be flagged by such nonsensical criteria
[13:17:15] <rsaarelm> Well, that's a bit of a problem isn't it? You need to know what lawnmowers are and what a reasonable price for one is...
[13:17:43] <nshepperd> PapuaHardyNet: nope, never used it
[13:17:46] <CoJaBo> rsaarelm: Yeh, that's why the huristic fails 5% of the time
[13:17:50] <PapuaHardyNet> how about incentivizing users to report correct scam entries?
[13:18:25] <CoJaBo> PapuaHardyNet: Almost all the entries get reported, but that usually takes hours to days, because people just don't report stuff, becaue people suck
[13:18:28] <nshepperd> i don't use any of the jax frameworks really
[13:18:59] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Technically, but it would also eliminate 99% of the userbase
[13:19:41] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, 99% of the userbase want to sell something before they buy something?
[13:20:11] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Only about 1% use both sides of the site
[13:20:52] <CoJaBo> And most of that 1% is actually also scammers lol
[13:21:30] <Gurkenglas> Ah. CoJaBo, suppose sellers have to deposit 1$ which is returned with their first successful transaction, and kept if you judge their listing a scam.
[13:21:52] <Gurkenglas> (upon first registering)
[13:21:56] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: just a heads up, stax is part of jax itself, and used in official jax examples
[13:21:58] <CoJaBo> We can't do stuff like that
[13:22:03] <Gurkenglas> Why not?
[13:24:36] <Gurkenglas> You're not allowed to profit off scam detection by law? Trivial inconveniences like that would stunt your growth?

[13:26:50] <CoJaBo> We can't do major changes to how the site works
[13:27:28] <Gurkenglas> Because you are a small department?
[13:28:14] <Gurkenglas> Could you distinguish the scammers by IP/ping?
[13:28:45] <saturn2> you could try throwing gpt at it
[13:30:01] <CoJaBo> saturn2: I've thus far thrown most things at it, including assorted furniture
[13:30:53] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: We don't always have access to the IP, and when we do, it's a standard residential IP 
[13:31:41] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, send a packet with instructions to send it back, if it gets back to one of your servers within a small time they physically can't be in india or nigeria
[13:32:04] <CoJaBo> RIP mobile users in the US
[13:32:17] <saturn2> these aren't good ideas lol
[13:32:25] <Gurkenglas> even mobile can return *one* of a hundred packets quickly, right?
[13:32:27] <CoJaBo> Also, RIP users in India and Nigeria
[13:32:35] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, that was pretty offensive
[13:32:43] <Gurkenglas> You have those? So much for that idea, then.
[13:32:48] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Mobile generally won't respond to ping, period
[13:33:17] <CoJaBo> Most of the IPs logged recently are in Texas
[13:33:22] <CoJaBo> (Scammer IPs)
[13:34:30] <PapuaHardyNet> manually screen all texan submissions
[13:34:31] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, I don't see why.
[13:34:39] <CoJaBo> Oh, this is interesting. The IP geolocation matches the location givenin the listings. I guess they think we're checking that (we aren't).
[13:35:18] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, what would happen if asked texan authorities to check those IPs?
[13:35:22] <Gurkenglas> *you
[13:35:26] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Nothing.
[13:35:43] <CoJaBo> Our best running theory is botnet nodes.
[13:36:20] <Gurkenglas> Aka, nothing because the texan authorities would say "its a botnet doofus"
[13:36:45] <CoJaBo> I'd imagine they wouldn't bother to respond at all
[13:36:57] <kuudes> scamming is in revealed preferences of people clearly
[13:37:08] <CoJaBo> We report far more illegal stuff than this on a regular basis, and it's rare for anything ever to come of it
[13:37:32] <Gurkenglas> why not, though? authorities aren't incentivized to deal with global crime?
[13:38:12] <CoJaBo> Most of the time it's involving stuff hosted by major companies
[13:38:26] <CoJaBo> Google and Reddit are the worst offenders
[13:38:43] <Gurkenglas> you mean, mostly the botnets live on google/reddit servers?
[13:38:51] <CoJaBo> Unrelated
[13:39:12] <CoJaBo> I just mean, we report illegal stuff hosted by Reddit and Google; it won't get taken down
[13:39:28] <CoJaBo> Someone did a youtube about this a while back
[13:39:37] <CoJaBo> And Reddit is being sued over it
[13:39:39] <Gurkenglas> You report it to google or to the cops?
[13:39:55] <CoJaBo> Both, doesn't matter. Neither will care.
[13:40:31] <Gurkenglas> Could you tell the texas ISP the botnetted IPs, and then grandma is sent a letter?
[13:41:30] <CoJaBo> lol
[13:42:17] <Gurkenglas> All you need to do is make buying more botnet more expensive than what they make from the scams :3
[13:42:32] <CoJaBo> At this point, we might as well just report 0.0.0.0/0, because literally every fricking thing's got malware on it these days
[13:43:09] <CoJaBo> If our users were smart, they'd dry up real quick
[13:43:38] <CoJaBo> This scam wouldn't work at all if users followed the "DON'T GET SCAMMED" guidelines on every single page
[13:43:40] <Gurkenglas> I heard Windows Defender works fine, is it mostly older computers and smart devices?
[13:44:34] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Not sure, but you see those ads sometimes for that free VPN software that's teeming with malware? I'd imagine that's the most common thing these use, tho that's just a wild guess.

[14:54:31] <CoJaBo> Scam calls are untracable
[14:55:17] <Gurkenglas> ...how does your phone provider know where to send the data so it comes out of their speaker?
[14:56:35] <CoJaBo> Internet stuff
[14:57:17] <Gurkenglas> aka these phone calls involve a lot of ping?
[14:57:20] <CoJaBo> Basically, they usually anonymously sign up for a call-forwarding service that they then use over the net
[14:58:12] <CoJaBo> One thing I've somewhat-seriously considered doing, was using the same setup to incessantly call in bomb threats sumultaneously to every single FCC and FTC office building
[14:58:45] <Gurkenglas> yeah, yeah, we all can end civilization as we know it
[14:59:18] <Gurkenglas> could you tell the call-forwarding service to stream all the audio from that number in particular to the police?
[14:59:37] <CoJaBo> Woudlda been fun to watch how fast those call-forwarding companies got KYC regulations piled on lol
[15:01:31] <CoJaBo> Stuff like that is supposedly happening now, in that the origin of calls is being cryptographically enforced. But telcos have no real incentive to hurry it up.
[15:02:43] <CoJaBo> Tho I think that only stops spoofed numbers, not forwarded calls which most scammers use anyway
[15:02:55] <Gurkenglas> or rather, is there a guy that is to the call-forwarding company as you are to your company, to whom you could suggest listening to those calls for leet points

They bristled at the suggestion that accidents were largely unavoidable, coming to suspect the opposite: that almost all accidents were avoidable, given the right tools, environment, and training."

[15:22:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems odd
[15:22:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wonder what kills people in factories today
[15:22:46] <Gurkenglas> Scammer spends 1$ on a number (or, uh, how much?). Police spends 30 seconds to a call from that number and determines that's a scammer. Taxpayer pays, I don't know, 20$ an hour to whoever at the police station does the listening? 20$ taxpayer money burnt, 120$ scammer money transferred to call-forwarding company.
[15:25:00] <Gurkenglas> and then... scammers start leaving the call-forwarding service, service desparately reduces the 1$ price tag to 10 cents... what's their call-forwarding company's profit span?
[15:25:55] <Gurkenglas> maybe competition already drove it down as far as it would go, in which case all the scammers could do is transfer more to the companies or switch approach entirely

[15:32:47] <Gurkenglas> the call forwarding companies should be *quite* in favor, since the actual effect is the scammers pay them more
[15:33:43] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: ..wat
[15:34:33] <Gurkenglas> ...or does the extra profit mean that this unlocks extra competition to drive the 1$ down to 20 ct...
[15:34:33] <CoJaBo> I can't even conceive of how much it would cost to have an army regiment of people listening in to scam calls for some reason
[15:35:51] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, 20 bucks a manhour? if every manhour transfers 120$ into the us that's worth it, right?
[15:36:58] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: ..where are you thinking $120 would magically come from rofl
[15:37:14] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, the scammers have to buy new numbers from the call-forwarding company, right?
[15:37:42] <CoJaBo> Sure, but it's a few dollars for a block of thousands

[15:54:04] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, if theoretically scammers spend 10% on food/home and 10% on call forwarding and 80% on luxuries and the next best scam approach would let them spend 50% on luxuries then it makes sense to put a tax on call-forwarding companies that leaves the scammers 51%, right?
[15:56:03] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Or, like, make it illegal to sell the service anonymously like I'd said. They won't do that tho, as there's no way to compel anyone to pass such a law.
[15:56:52] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, it is better to tax it as I said than to make it illegal because that way more of the scammed money makes it back to the US. Or do you mean that one could drive them entirely out of business?
[15:59:46] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: There's no way you could justify a tax that'd be hundreds of times the price of the service lol

[16:27:03] <CoJaBo> Man, that was stupid
[16:27:20] <CoJaBo> So, it was running the test against LIVE data, instead of historic
[16:27:48] <CoJaBo> Live data has no scam posts, because we banned all the ones we identified when building the model
[16:28:11] <CoJaBo> So it wasn't even the frickin AI that was busted, I just suck at typing
[16:28:27] <CoJaBo> I really, really have to stop coding at 3am
[16:28:39] <Gurkenglas> Shadowbanned or regular banned?
[16:28:59] <CoJaBo> Tarpitted, which is basically a shadowban with extra steps
[16:29:33] <CoJaBo> I didn't notice it was running on live either, because the ingest task had crashed
[16:30:33] <CoJaBo> As soon as I restarted that, the AI model immediately produced a ton of results, identifying several dozen posts all of which appear to be dead-on accurate
[16:31:15] <Gurkenglas> in retrospect i should have noticed when you said 0% false positive
[16:31:36] <CoJaBo> This generally doesn't have false-positives
[16:31:59] <Gurkenglas> then it's not sensitive enough.
[16:32:33] <CoJaBo> It's not possible to make it more sensitive without risking throwing out good users
[16:32:39] <Gurkenglas> Make it more sensitive until it generates a false positive, then check whether there were other scams you weren't aware of.
[16:33:14] <CoJaBo> Loosening up the criteria very quickly degenerates to utter garbagé
[16:34:04] <Gurkenglas> I suppose it's possible that there's an architecture that acts this way. When you train it on the older half of scams, does it flag the newer half?
[16:34:12] <CoJaBo> The scams this can't see are mostly single users independently trying to scam people, who won't be able to evade an IP ban
[16:35:08] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: It does now. In testing it did not, even when simulating newer data being fed in. I don't know how/why that happened, but it must be another bug somewhere, tho I don't think I'm gonna hunt for it, as it so far clearly seems to work

[16:36:48] <CoJaBo> "a screen shot of a phone" seems like the most useless possible classification possible
[16:36:55] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, by "now", do you mean "when trained on everything" or "when trained on the old half but run outside a testing framework"
[16:37:54] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: I had started the filter on the live data, but nothing was happening because the ingest task had crashed, and the testing framework was broken and running on the wrong data altogether
[16:38:15] <CoJaBo> As soon as I restored live data, it started getting hits
[16:39:26] <Gurkenglas> Does it currently, when told that the older half of scams are scams but not told that the newer half of scams are scams, detect fine in the 2nd newest quarter but deteriorate in the newest quarter?
[16:39:50] <Gurkenglas> I ask because this may tell you whether it gets fooled by new kinds of scams, in which case you'll need to keep flagging false negatives.
[16:40:14] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: The output of this is filtered down to a sharp pass/fail
[16:42:51] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, not my question. When you pretend that you implemented this AI a year ago, so you wouldn't have this year's data, and then you run it on the last year to predict how it'll do a year from now, what do you find?
[16:44:05] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: This is built on about 4 (possibly 7) years of data, with very little varience from start to finish other than that they post more often
[16:44:54] <CoJaBo> If they change it up, this would be useless. But I've targetted something that's pretty fundamental to how they're scamming; fixing this on their end will cost time and money.
[16:44:55] <Gurkenglas> You couldn't tell a random post from this year from a random post from the first year? Fair enough, then.
[16:46:54] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: There's a byte-identical post from a year ago that matches one from almost 2 years prior to that. This isn't sophisticated in terms of evading detection, just that they have a lot of time/people to fill out captchas and create email addresses.
[16:48:30] <Gurkenglas> Hallelujah that Google found a way to make money from captchas. Do you get some of it?
[16:49:15] <CoJaBo> We have our own custom CAPTHAS on most things, since Google's is too easily beaten
[16:49:47] <CoJaBo> That's not useful here, because actual humans make the accounts
[16:50:13] <CoJaBo> They actually have to fill out 3-4 captchas per listing too, it doesn't slow them down at all
[16:50:47] <Gurkenglas> ...give them the option to pay you money instead of filling out captchas
[16:51:30] <CoJaBo> Paid users don't have capchas, so technically we already do
[16:52:04] <Gurkenglas> price is too high, since they aren't buying accounts.
[16:52:22] <CoJaBo> Solving capthcs is way cheaper
[16:52:40] <CoJaBo> Last sale was in July
[16:52:53] <CoJaBo> Should probably just delete that feature, really
[16:53:17] <Gurkenglas> How many scam listings are these? at 3-4 useless captchas per piece...
[16:53:36] <CoJaBo> They usually around 4 per hour
[16:53:47] <CoJaBo> (that make it thru the first-line filters)
[16:55:46] <CoJaBo> 1-2 per minute seems to be the pre-filtered average, tho that includes scams, spam, and OnlySpammers™ that aren't related to that one persistant group

[17:00:31] <CoJaBo> I don't think they're sophisticated enough to divide the work like that. The captchas are solved by the person typing or pasting the scam listing

[18:02:40] <CoJaBo> Reddit is being sued over this, but google is probably too big for that unless Pepsi or such gets involved.
[18:02:51] <CoJaBo> what logs?
[18:03:21] <Gurkenglas> the logs of the activity they're legally required to activid, of course!
[18:03:57] <CoJaBo> I mean, it's a public URL, pretty easy to verify it's there.
[18:04:21] <Gurkenglas> the logs of the reports and what they did about them and when.
[18:04:51] <CoJaBo> Reddit replied to the report saying the content "doesn't violate their content policy". Google hasn't responded in close to 8 years.
[18:05:30] <CoJaBo> People vastly overestimate how much corporations care about following the law.
[18:05:41] <Gurkenglas> right so those logs would presumably show the proceedings of their investigation from 7.9 years ago, although it may be reasonable not to keep them for more than 5.
[18:06:09] <Gurkenglas> Presumably they care about following the law in ways that are checkable?
[18:06:18] <CoJaBo> Clearly, nope.
[18:06:46] <CoJaBo> Youtube was an exception, because someone went after their ad money. They care if you **** with their ad money.
[18:07:13] <CoJaBo> The other sites don't have large enough advertisers to stage such a fiasco tho.
[18:08:14] <Gurkenglas> so what prevents citizen: "google doesnt keep report logs!" judge: "google, produce logs." google: "uhhhhhhhh"
[18:08:38] <Gurkenglas> judge: "one million gazillion nonillion fine."
[18:10:48] <CoJaBo> We don't have a cause of action against Google.
[18:11:28] <Gurkenglas> Ah, so it's not easily checkable. Does no one ever call Google Logs as a witness?
[18:17:01] <Gurkenglas> This time the equilibrium I'm poking has a lot more mass, of course ^^
[18:25:39] <CoJaBo> Obviously that it's there is easily checkable (if you don't mind going to jail). Reddit report responses are also easily checkable. Google just doesn't reply, so only our outgoing mail logs would have that.
[18:27:36] <Gurkenglas> <CoJaBo> Obviously that it's there is easily checkable (if you don't mind going to jail) <- by easily breaking into google's servers, or what? ...

[18:32:38] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Reddit actually sends you a message telling you the illegal content doesn't violate their TOS, usually several weeks after the day you reported it
[18:34:05] <CoJaBo> I once did get a reply from Google after nine years, for something I, apparently, personally reported on Google Maps. I have no fricking idea what it was. The reply simply stated that they investigated, and didn't find anything at the reported location. Whell no $#@% sherlock.

[18:43:48] <PapuaHardyNet> everything is terrible (if you try to win legally)
[18:44:05] <Gurkenglas> That sounds different from what I had in mind, here. So it's not that they can afford to scour all the law books for a technicality and then the judge rules in their favor because of that every time
[18:44:18] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: They're fond of doing that too, yeh.
[18:44:30] <Gurkenglas> It's that they... can spend money to make you spend money? In what way?
[18:44:35] <nshepperd2> they can just drag out the lawsuit with procedural stuff until you run out of money
[18:44:55] <Gurkenglas> so what if i represent myself, and thus spend no money
[18:45:00] <CoJaBo> If your case isn't rock-solid, they'll weasel out of it real quick, and send you the bill for their legal team, because they can usually do that.
[18:45:31] <Gurkenglas> So why doesn't everyone hire google's legal team, if the hirer doesn't usually have to pay for it?
[18:46:02] <CoJaBo> You still need the money to hire them lol. Expensive lawyers don't work on contingency.
[18:46:31] <PapuaHardyNet> you pay your lawyers first, then you send the bill to the other party anyway
[18:46:50] <Gurkenglas> does a bank give credit for a case you'd win given google's legal team?
[18:48:00] <Gurkenglas> And why wouldn't expensive lawyers work on contingency?
[18:48:26] <Gurkenglas> Sounds like they'd get hired by common citizens a lot more.
[18:48:28] <CoJaBo> Because they'd be taking a risk, and a huge one if they're also taking on other expensive lawyers.
[18:49:05] <CoJaBo> If both sides have lawyers on contingency, someone isn't getting paid. That wouldn't be very smart at all :P
[18:49:10] <Gurkenglas> a 50/50 risk, then! doesn't this let them use twice their regular fee?
[18:50:04] <nshepperd2> come on
[18:50:21] <Gurkenglas> you have a case that's 50% likely to win 10 craploads. you could pay 1 for a legal team if you have one to start with, or you could hire them on contingency for 2, whats the catch
[18:50:46] <nshepperd2> a 50% risk mean you need 100% interest to break even on average. that makes the loan pointless
[18:51:27] <Gurkenglas> How so? If you win you're good for it.
[18:52:30] <Gurkenglas> the bank judges that your case is good, pays the lawyer 1 crapload, if you win 10 you have to give the bank 3.

[19:29:46] <gwern> from 1907? not sure. I know it's gone down a ton relatively since like, 1970s, but unsure about absolute or compared to 1907. the US population has like... 5xed? or something since then. quite a lot

[19:33:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> So if productivity goes up and industry workforce as percentage of population goes down, then the reduction in that quantity is going to be greater than just the reduction in per-workforce-population fatality rate

[19:47:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> To my question about "why can't industrial fatality rates be reduced further" (which I posted on that LW thread), someone responds:
[19:48:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I don’t know the first one, but I am pretty sure the answer to the second one is “because that would make things more expensive”. (Fundamentally, the same reason why all code isn’t unit-tested.) The punishments for workplace fatalities are set externally, the company does the _cost-benefit analysis_ and acts accordingly.
[19:48:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> So maybe the solution could be “increase the penalties for workplace injuries/fatalities by a few orders of magnitude, and see how the market reacts”, but maybe at some moment _weird_ things would start happening. Like, if the penalty for workplace fatality is paid to survivors, some workers would choose to sacrifice their life for early retirement of their families. Or new types of crimes would appear, for example
[19:48:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  assassinations of your competitor’s workers so that it looks like a workplace fatality, and then because of astronomic penalties your competitor goes out of business. More likely, the employers would find some legal loophole, like forcing the workers to _technically_ become self-employed subcontractors, in which case the worker would become legally responsible for his own death, not his _de facto_ employer."
[19:48:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is a sensible response, of course. Makes total sense.
[19:49:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> But this specific question aside, I just noticed a parallel between this pattern... and Jaynes's "resurrection of death hypotheses"

[20:58:29] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, over here it appears that "currently" (2019) in steel casting we have about 10 injuries per million work hours where injury results at least of 4 days of missed work, including death

[21:06:42] <feepbot> A New Company With a Wild Mission: Bring Back the Woolly Mammoth - The New York Times (With $15 million in private funding, Colossal aims to bring thousands of woolly mammoths back to Siberia. Some scientists are deeply skeptical that will happen.)
[21:13:31] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: I don't know how to translate that into the units used in the article
[21:15:07] <kuudes> yeah
[21:15:32] <kuudes> I think it is at least 1/10 lower if we take that any 4+ day thing would also be counted as death
[21:15:48] <kuudes> so over here indeed it seems to me 1/10 or 1/100 of the named numbers seems possible
[21:16:03] <kuudes> would be interesting to find out if there are in general such 10x or 100x differences between countries
[21:16:13] <kuudes> maybe in nordics steelcasting is safer than in usa?
[21:22:31] <feep> freshly showered~
[21:23:06] <feep> "Some scientists are deeply skeptical that will happen" is a sentence that stars in the summary of approximately every disaster movie
[21:25:38] <rmmh> eh there are dumber startups
[21:26:03] <rmmh> blowing $15M to try to revive mammoths sounds way better than blowing $15M for some dumb cloud thing
[21:26:39] <gwern> the really interesting part is they're going for artificial wombs
[21:26:59] <rmmh> have the artificial lamb wombs worked out?
[21:27:07] <PapuaHardyNet> wouldn't you love a wooly mammoth pet
[21:27:24] <gwern> rmmh: they get better gradually. that's research for you. if it had worked out, it wouldn't be research
[21:27:44] <rmmh> I mean, have they had successes
[21:27:57] <gwern> define success
[21:28:11] <gwern> (forget wooly mammoths - if they crack multi-year artificial wombs en route to mammoths, that puts us pretty close to human artificial wombs, which would potentially change a lot)
[21:28:15] <rmmh> neat https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421734/artificial-womb-fetus-biobag-uterus-lamb-sheep-birth-premie-preterm-infant

Over four weeks, their...)
[21:28:49] <rmmh> I would expect human artificial wombs to be banned almost everywhere because of long-term concerns
[21:29:05] <kuudes> wouldn't that be anti-life?
[21:29:16] <rmmh> nobody cares if your undead mammoth is 30% dumber
[21:29:30] <gwern> rmmh: an artificial womb ~= really good pre-emie care. that makes it hard to ban
[21:29:33] <kuudes> I mean, if we are pro-life, then surely all of the embryos should be placed to artificial wombs by the state or healthcare provider
[21:29:35] <rmmh> kind of like how cloned animals have health problems
[21:29:41] <gwern> they don't, though
[21:29:47] <rmmh> oh, did they fix that?
[21:29:48] <kuudes> indeed
[21:29:58] <gwern> it's a mix of 'yes' and 'it was never really a problem'
[21:30:07] <rmmh> At the time of her euthanization, Dolly was noted to have arthritis and had a form of lung cancer called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which is also known as jaagsiekte. It is a fairly common disease in sheep, particularly in those kept indoors. For security reasons, Dolly had to sleep inside.
[21:30:12] <PapuaHardyNet> if human artificial wombs succeed, it will be hard to ban them
[21:30:21] <gwern> rmmh: indeed, but her clone-sibs did fine
[21:30:27] <rmmh> misremembered, I guess
[21:30:41] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: my concern is how you demonstrate efficacy/safety
[21:31:01] <gwern> it's more that everyone breathlessly reported about 'Dollie, first cloned mammal, dies young!' and omits the 'of a perfectly common sheep disease and her siblings are still fine'
[21:31:06] <rmmh> that the vat-humans aren't predisposed to a bunch of extra diseases because they missed X nutrient or stimuli in the womb
[21:31:47] <kuudes> I would think that soon natural pregnancies could be as shunned as home birthing
[21:32:01] <rmmh> I don't buy it. They're not *that* dangerous.
[21:32:06] <kuudes> ie the nonstandardized care options bring risk to the baby
[21:32:20] <kuudes> fas etc?
[21:32:46] <kuudes> if everyone functional uses a-wombs, then only narcs and poor don't use them
[21:33:05] <kuudes> -> non a-wombed people get worse start
[21:34:22] <gwern> 'Initially, Dr. Church envisioned implanting embryos into surrogate female elephants. But he eventually soured on the idea. Even if he could figure out in vitro fertilization for elephants — which no one has done before — building a herd would be impractical, since he would need so many surrogates.

[21:36:29] <rmmh> is it cruel to birth wooly mammoths as we reach the highest global temperatures in a million years 
[21:36:39] <gwern> rmmh: presumably they will. it'd be foolish to do very expensive editing of elephant embryos to mammothfy them without a thoroughly prototyped artificial womb

[21:42:53] <rmmh> it's hard to imagine the economics for artifical wombs working out initially 
[21:43:00] <rmmh> surrogacy is like $100k
[21:44:33] <gwern> I'm not sure it's that high, but surrogacy is a lot of trouble and countries love to ban it out of populist nationalism
[21:45:16] <gwern> artificial wombs should enjoy experience curves and economies of scale, and of course it's a lot easier to buy a thousand artificial wombs than a thousand surrogates, should you have some need for that like, say, a john von neummann cloning program
[21:47:35] <kuudes> pregnancy is a real health risk to a living human, and sort of comparable to paid organ donation etc

[22:41:22] <gwern> if you had a dozen american prisoners, you'd have to be insane to let one of your troops go rogue and shoot them. meanwhile, iraqis know they're a dime a dozen
[22:41:50] <kuudes> ie as it is in no way mandatory for anyone to go contracting in iraq, there is no need for anyone to shoot iraqi prisoners. they do it on their own responsibility
