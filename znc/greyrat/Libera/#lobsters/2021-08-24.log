[00:03:09] <manicennui> heh
[00:03:16] <manicennui> Note the levels.
[00:06:01] <manicennui> The one entry they have for our entry level position pretty much confirms what I thought.
[00:06:08] <manicennui> $94k for a fresh grad.
[00:06:43] <manicennui> And $109k for the level above that, which can be obtained in 18-24 months.
[00:09:21] <ben> i could use a raise
[00:10:10] <manicennui> Yeah, I like money too.

[00:15:27] <JordiGH> Whatever happened to glassdoor, btw?
[00:15:35] <JordiGH> It's now impossible to actually get data out of them, right?
[00:15:44] <bkero> It does what it always does -- lag behind. Also put more stuff behind the sign-up wall.
[00:15:54] <JordiGH> Just authwall, not paywall?
[00:18:07] <bkero> Yeah
[00:18:12] <bkero> At least in my experience.
[00:21:25] <JordiGH> My current company is too poverty to be in levels.fyi
[00:21:48] <JordiGH> I am suddenly wishing for a particular Twitch emote to express this level of poverty.
