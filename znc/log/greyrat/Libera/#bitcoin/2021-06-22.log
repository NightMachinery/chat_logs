[08:50:36] <grundle> schmillin: it's scheduled maintenance supposedly
[08:50:41] <grundle> they chose a real fucked time to do it
[08:50:54] <schmillin> The estimated time for this maintenance is approximately 8 hours...
[08:51:08] <schmillin> and accounce the scheduled maintence when it went down
[08:51:19] <grundle> name__: probably news about china's latest crackdown on mining, and uncertainty over the constitutionality of el salvadors bitcoin law
[08:51:31] <schmillin> https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-under-investigation-by-justice-department-irs-bloomberg-news-2021-05-13/
[08:51:49] <grundle> pretty sure binance is hosted out of cayman islands right?
[08:51:51] <schmillin> cut and run? 8 hours to leave the country?
[08:52:06] <grundle> maybe they're hosted in some shitty datacenter
[08:52:15] <grundle> I hope they don't cut and run, I've got money in there right now lol
[08:52:29] <schmillin> malta
[08:52:30] <schmillin> https://craft.co/binance/locations
[08:52:31] <grundle> their maintenance totally fucked up the simulations i was doing with zenbot though
[08:52:37] <grundle> ah malta
[08:52:49] <grundle> wonder if i should have just gone with bitfinex
[08:53:38] <grundle> I wonder what makes binance a target as opposed to other exchanges.  they have binance.us which is supposedly complaint with the US
[08:53:53] <schmillin> lol
[08:54:25] <roasbeef> grundle: many exchanges these days have a U.S arm that doesn't have all the derivatives products their main arm does, similar w/ FTX
[08:54:44] <grundle> yeah ftx.us or w/e
[08:55:07] <roasbeef> yep, I think ledger x is the only licenced derivs exchange in the U.S
[08:55:34] <grundle> I really hope to accrue a fair amount of BTC before regulation comes in full swing
[08:55:49] <grundle> imho once crypto is heavily regulated the time to really build growth is likely over
[08:56:19] <grundle> i've already got transaction fees to pay now uncle sam wants a slice
[08:56:36] <schmillin> might have better luck with eth if defi takes off
[08:56:45] <schmillin> who knows tho
[08:56:47] <grundle> I've got all my eth staked
[08:56:50] <grundle> we'll see
[08:57:21] <grundle> apart from btc and eth i'm hard pressed to get too invested in any other alt
[08:57:41] <grundle> i'll include monero in that i guess, it has a valid usecase still

[10:26:17] <KGB> robertspigler you can, and should only allow incoming connections to your node over a tor v3 hidden service, discovery of the node is pretty damn difficult. Outgoing connections should be allowed only over TCP, you don't have to use any DNS so announcing your server to the DNS root-servers at every reboot is not what you want, so UDP disable. By
[10:26:17] <KGB> default all computer at reboot sending packages to root DNS servers over UDP and those sewrvers are operated by NASA, Department of Defense etc.. Your Bitcoin node as a hidden service, with restrictive firewall is a perfectly secure service.

[10:28:22] <KGB> however, you should be aware that recently Tor is managed by an American corporation called "The Tor Project Inc" they can and will shutdown the network at they will: https://darknetdaily.com/2021/01/09/all-v3-onion-addresses-down-after-attack-on-the-tor-network/

[10:30:43] <KGB> you should also ban in your Tor setup all connections to relays in Germany and Netherlands because those relays are operated by secret services, you need an OBSF4 bridge in a safe country outside of the NATO alliance.
[10:32:06] <KGB> Than you would have a safe Bitcoin node behind a hidden service, but nothing would protect you from the "Tor Project Inc" which can simply take down the entire network at any moment as the recent attack has demonstrated: https://darknetdaily.com/2021/01/09/all-v3-onion-addresses-down-after-attack-on-the-tor-network/
[10:34:23] <KGB> Tor project Inc and American corporation can shutdown the entire Tor Network by taking offline the so called "consensus authority nodes". I highly recommend to have some console to your server so if the tor networks taken down you are still able to access the restrictive server without opening any port.

[11:32:25] <KGB> China isn't banned Bitcoin mining, it is only targeting miners who selling Bitcoin not to the 1.5 billion people who lives in China, but to the Americans. China obviously sees a threat in Bitcoin mining when all mined Bitcoin is sold to American firms. The Chinese government in fact made various statements that the use of Bitcoin is acceptable. If
[11:32:26] <KGB> American miners would sell all Bitcoin to Chinese firms, I'm pretty sure the FBI would jump on it and call them spies and "national security threat"

Electricity isn't cheap and American laws regarding Bitcoin and
[11:37:39] <KGB> cryptocurrency trading are extremely restrictive. A legitimate Bitcoin miner would look to other countries like Mongolia or Russia where electricity is cheap and the laws are relaxed.
