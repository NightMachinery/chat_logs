[00:45:44] <PlayerOne> Hey all ^^
[00:45:54] <PlayerOne> Why would `^(?:\-?[0-9]+\s*){2}$` match just 123?
[00:46:14] <PlayerOne> The main mission is to have it eat two integers (pos and neg)
[00:46:45] <PlayerOne> This works: `^(?:\-?[0-9]+\s+){2}$`, but only if it has the space at end like: '-312 123 '
[00:47:01] <PlayerOne> \s* vs \s+ part
[00:47:07] <lopid> why are you escaping the hyphen?
[00:47:14] <PlayerOne> Just in case : D
[00:47:16] <rewt> \s* means 0 or more spaces; \s+ means 1 or more spaces
[00:47:24] <PlayerOne> rewt, of course
[00:47:25] <rewt> don't escape "just in case"... it causes confusion
[00:47:42] <PlayerOne> But why it doesn't look for the second [0-9] then?
[00:47:55] <PlayerOne> With \s*
[00:48:04] <rewt> what second [0-9]?
[00:48:08] <PlayerOne> {2}?
[00:48:19] <rewt> ?
[00:48:29] <PlayerOne> (?:...){2}
[00:48:33] <rewt> what about it?
[00:48:41] <PlayerOne> It's about the second presence
[00:48:49] <rewt> you need to be more clear about your questions; keep in mind that we don't read minds and don't see what you see outside this channel
[00:48:59] <lopid> https://regex101.com/r/u2tDvi/1/
[00:49:08] <PlayerOne> I verbally said the main mission above, dear rewt 
[00:49:15] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:49:17] <karhunkynsii> It'll match "123" with [0-9]+, then give up one digit and match again.
[00:49:24] <PlayerOne> Holy smokes
[00:49:39] <PlayerOne> Please, take a look again, `^(?:\-?[0-9]+\s*){2}$
[00:50:04] <PlayerOne> Removed the hyphen: `^(?:-?[0-9]+\s*){2}$
[00:50:16] <lopid> removed hyphen. shows hyphen
[00:50:19] <PlayerOne> hyphen escape*
[00:50:32] <rewt> put it on regex101.com with what you're trying to match, so we see what you mean exactly
[00:50:44] <PlayerOne> lopid, it seems like you're funny here today, huh
[00:51:16] <PlayerOne> Ah. Nevermind pals. It seems you'll all here today are funny. Well. Have a nice day, then ^^
[00:51:39] <karhunkynsii> PlayerOne, did you read what i said?
[00:51:50] <PlayerOne> Did you read what I said?
[00:52:02] <lopid> sounded like a goodbye to me
[00:52:06] <PlayerOne> Yup
[00:52:09] <rewt> <PlayerOne> Why would `^(?:\-?[0-9]+\s*){2}$` match just 123?  <-- bad question; that regex matches more than just 123
[00:52:20] <rewt> <PlayerOne> This works: `^(?:\-?[0-9]+\s+){2}$`, but only if it has the space at end like: '-312 123 '   <-- so what's the problem?
[00:52:32] <PlayerOne> rewt, that's what is the question? Why the heck it's bad?
[00:52:36] <rewt> <PlayerOne> The main mission is to have it eat two integers (pos and neg)  <-- you gave a working answer, so what's the question?
[00:52:44] <rewt> what's bad?
[00:52:51] <PlayerOne> I'm literally asking why the heck this happens? And you're answer is: bad question.
[00:53:00] <PlayerOne> Then go get a good question yourself then.
[00:53:00] <karhunkynsii> https://regex101.com/r/u2tDvi/2
[00:53:01] <rewt> put it on regex101.com; it tells you
[00:53:20] <rewt> <+rewt> put it on regex101.com with what you're trying to match, so we see what you mean exactly
[00:53:28] <karhunkynsii> Check it with capture group.  First round ends up matching "12", second matches "3".
[00:54:05] <PlayerOne> I said you. Nevermind. I don't want to beg you or fucking get on knees for you majestic help out here listening for that bullshit like the fuck did I even ask
[00:54:08] <PlayerOne> Grow up, ladies
[00:54:22] <PlayerOne> Thank you.
[00:54:49] <rewt> i said it's a bad question because it matches more than just 123... was asking for clarification
[00:54:51] <PlayerOne> No help needed today. You're free from my god damn existence today.
[00:54:57] <lopid> stays
