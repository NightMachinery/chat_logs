[02:03:44] <acdw> oh lemme see
[02:04:02] <acdw> it is indeed
[02:05:18] <bremner> hrm. It seems work here to specify -inbox, I wonder what is going on
[02:05:39] <acdw> no diea
[02:05:40] <bremner> acdw: can you try with a minimal config, ideally in emacs -q?
[02:05:41] <acdw> idea8
[02:05:45] <acdw> i can when i get home i think
[02:05:51] <acdw> might have to table this and come back later
[02:06:31] <bremner> okie dokie
[02:06:40] <acdw> thanks :D
[02:07:05] <acdw> real quick -- something like emacs -q --load /path/to/notmuch.el ... ?
[02:07:07] <acdw> or w/e?
[02:07:28] <bremner> yeah, that should do it
[02:07:40] <bremner> or ./devel/try-emacs-mua in the source

[02:09:08] <acdw> oh hey smart
[02:09:17] <acdw> i will do that ( i have notmuch from source )
[02:11:00] <bremner> in that case ./devel/try-emacs-mua -q
[02:12:00] <acdw> okay i'm doing this
[02:12:06] <acdw> aha that's what i did!
[02:12:13] <acdw> right now, Fcc: sent is what i see
[02:12:22] <acdw> i spose I should try to set notmuch-fcc-dirs
[02:16:20] <acdw> well that seems to make it work
[02:16:47] <acdw> (setq notmuch-fcc-dirs `((".*" . ,(concat "\"fastmail/Sent\"" " +sent +personal -inbox -unread"))))
[02:17:26] <bremner> why do you need concat for a constant string?
[02:17:39] <bremner> not that it matters, I gues
[02:17:43] <acdw> for better line wrapping
[02:17:48] <acdw> but i could probably ... not do that
[02:17:52] <bremner> ah. fair enoug.
