[00:00:23] <marstaik[m]> I then want to keep myself up to date with upstream, so I checkout upstream into another local branch
[00:00:27] <nedbat> marstaik[m]: i would recommend not deleting those folders.  why not just keep them?
[00:00:56] <marstaik[m]> Extra things that aren't really needed
[00:01:03] <ikke> delete them when deploying?
[00:01:04] <marstaik[m]> I dont even have them registered in the build system
[00:01:54] <marstaik[m]> In this particular case, Ive ported the upstream to a completely different buildsystem, so every time I merge it keeps trying to bring their build files back, there are large amounts of thirdparty libraries I don't care for either

[00:05:08] <vaio> ohai, which self-hosted "git platform" would your recommend ? ie: gogs, gitea, something else ?
[00:05:28] <ikke> depends on your needs
[00:05:50] <ikke> gitea and gogs are quite similar (one forked from the other)
[00:06:09] <vaio> well, it's gonna be a public infra containing some project documentation, and we need to be able to "filter" who can access it
[00:06:21] <nedbat> marstaik[m]: why delete them at all?
[00:06:44] <marstaik[m]> theres just so much of them, and the clutter
[00:07:02] <vaio> (ie: clients will need to access it, and presumably provide PR; also, it needs to be user friendly, so non technical people would be able to edit stuff from within the browser)
[00:07:19] <ikke> gitlab supports that
[00:07:26] <nedbat> marstaik[m]: clutter on your disk? are you running out of space? don't complicate your life needlessly
[00:07:37] <vaio> neat, gonna take a look, thanks ikke
[00:09:47] <marstaik[m]> mmmm Id have to think about it
[00:10:01] <marstaik[m]> There are other files I have deleted too that I actually do need to keep deleted as well
[00:10:15] <nedbat> marstaik[m]: ok, those files: why do they have to be deleted?
[00:10:31] <nedbat> marstaik[m]: is the upstream uninterested in your changes?
[00:10:45] <marstaik[m]> In this case, yese
