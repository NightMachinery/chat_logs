[06:16:10] <MuchoLoco> it's a claim.
[06:16:13] <LjL> MuchoLoco, he meant more *sentence* context
[06:16:21] <LjL> it's unanswerable the way you stated it
[06:16:24] <MuchoLoco> no, there's no context.
[06:16:27] <LjL> "insist on call" on its own means nothing to me
[06:16:29] <MuchoLoco> it's a marketing claim.
[06:17:18] <LjL> well then the answer is "insist on your expectations" is "proper" in that it's a somewhat understandable, if vague, sentence; it's not equivalent on "insist on call" because "insist on call" likely doesn't mean much
[06:17:57] <MuchoLoco> i want to express that the potential customer should insist on his (high) expectations. and by doing so, he should choose the brand that useses the claim.
[06:18:28] <MuchoLoco> doesn't mean much isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[06:18:36] <MuchoLoco> it leaves room for interpretation.
[06:19:34] <LuisP14> doesn't tell me anything
[06:19:57] <MuchoLoco> it shouldn't tell anything.
[06:20:20] <MuchoLoco> apart from what i said about expectations on quality.

[06:21:46] <tinwhiskers> I don't think it's terrible as a tagline. It doesn't mean anything specific but has a certain vibe - kinda like pink floyd music.
[06:21:48] <MetaNova> or, "demand excellence"
[06:22:21] <MetaNova> to me, "insist on your expectations" sort of makes sense, but not really, and "insist on call" makes no sense to me
[06:22:45] <tinwhiskers> yeah, I have no idea what that means
[06:22:47] <MetaNova> as a tagline, I'd question if the company actually /read/ the proposed slogan before publishing it, and I'd question their competence _as a whole_
[06:23:00] <tinwhiskers> heh
[06:23:03] <MetaNova> it would make me avoid them

[17:15:14] <soulisson> I understand that the expression "to be on the side of someone means to support this person against someone else", I was wondering about the origin of this expression. Does anyone know it?
[17:16:58] <dracula> soulisson: it's quite literal, don't you think?
[17:18:08] <rapha> is anyone here watching The Good Fight and can educate me on who the seductive lady is that Jay keeps seeing throughout season 5, episode 5? all his hallucinations are supposed to be historical figures (karl marx, jesus, frederick douglass), so who is she?

[17:20:19] <soulisson> dracula, I don't know. I'm not a native english speaker. The word sied has several meanings, it could be linked to two sides as in two teams, the two sides of an area with adversaries on each side, could also mean to be near that person, so I don't know sorry.
[17:21:14] <dracula> soulisson: it could be thought of as two sides in a game.

[17:23:59] <dracula> soulisson: they're both the same.
[17:26:38] <soulisson> dracula, there is a difference, for the second, I meant that there 2 parts of an area, like in a tennis court, one part for each player. I wanted to know if you're referring to 2 teams or the other one.

[17:30:35] <soulisson> dracula, ok, thanks a lot. That's what I wanted to know. I understood the meaning but wanted to know the "origin". Sorry for the stupid question.

[17:31:33] <dracula> soulisson: it's meaning is quite literal. so i don't think there is a traceable origin. in the past, it must have referred to war more than sports.
[17:32:19] <huf> or just arguments
[17:32:22] <soulisson> dracula, ok, that was my initial feeling. 
[17:32:59] <dracula> soulisson: is there no expression like that in your tongue?
[17:35:38] <soulisson> yes, there is one, it's the same. I had the feeling it was what you said, but since I doubt a lot, and the other explanations could be valid, I decided to ask the qestion instead of trying to guess :)
[17:41:01] <dracula> soulisson: " God is not on the side of the big battalions, but on the side of those who shoot best."

[19:36:30] <lall-> within their natural environment, you'll see a lot of confused ... apex predators.
[19:37:46] <CuriosTiger> I have seen some confused tigers.
[19:37:51] <CuriosTiger> One was very confused by gravity.
[19:38:12] <lall-> Dogs have good depth perception, so do cats... but again, if you drive a car and they run to the street, they will see the lights but will have no idea how far you actually are from them because you're moving in super unnatural way, to them.
[19:38:39] <CuriosTiger> In his enclosure, he had a small "house" made of plywood. Mainly so he'd have a place to seek shelter from the rain. Instead of going in his house, he liked to sleep on top of it.
[19:38:44] <lall-> In their universe, stuff that moves like a car moves is so foreign, even with developed depth perception, they can't... figure it out.
[19:39:14] <CuriosTiger> One day, he was asleep on top of his box -- kicking with his legs as animals sometimes do when they're dreaming -- and he connected with one of the posts holding up his enclosure.
[19:39:14] <lall-> hahah. even if it's raining? :)
[19:39:34] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, this particular tiger never cared about rain.
[19:39:56] <CuriosTiger> He kicked himself off the enclosure -- landing on his back in an extremely un-cat-like manner.

[19:40:20] <CuriosTiger> it was one of the most hilarious things I've seen in my life. :P
[19:41:37] <lall-> I had a serious nasty dream few days ago, it was so nasty (and it does not happen to me often), that I woke up and it took me 10 minutes ot figure out what's reality, what's dream.
[19:42:18] <CuriosTiger> Nightmare?
[19:42:24] <lall-> basically all of my kids died in the dream... in a car crash.
[19:42:25] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, those don't happen to me much, fortunately.
[19:42:28] <CuriosTiger> Ouch :(
[19:42:38] <lall-> and then i woke up, trying to figure out... if it happened for real, or what the hell is going on.
[19:43:07] <lall-> i have dreams like that, but i usually can figure out what's real after i wake up. this time, i couldn't. it took me a while to figure it out.
[19:43:53] <lall-> surely animals experience similar things on occasion.
[19:45:11] <lall-> I'm a dog guy... but I admire cats. Throughout my childhood i had dozens of cats in my village. They are so shrewd, it's another level. Apex predators. Even the housecat.
[19:45:43] <lall-> Billions of pigeons die every year because of house cats. They are just blood thirsty, even domesticated.
[19:46:46] <lall-> ...and you can see it in their eyes. All soft and cuddly, and then you look at their eyes... reptilian cold
[19:48:43] <CuriosTiger> Or you pet them
[19:48:45] <CuriosTiger> and they purr
[19:48:49] <CuriosTiger> and life is happiness
[19:48:57] <CuriosTiger> and then all of a sudden they claw the shit out of you for no reason.
[19:49:11] <CuriosTiger> Just because they'd had enough petting. :P
[19:49:33] <lall-> There was some kind of study, saying... cat purr reduces stress levels (of humans). There's something soothing about petting a purring cat.
[19:49:58] <rapha> hmm
[19:50:07] <CuriosTiger> There is.
[19:50:10] <rapha> if you put me next to a purring cat for more than ten minutes i'll go bonkers
[19:50:18] <CuriosTiger> There's also something soothing about petting a happy tiger, even if they don't purr.
[19:50:25] <lall-> it might be nonsense, i read it long time ago. But i do quite enjoy a purring cat.

[19:51:36] <CuriosTiger> lall-: No, I've never put any of my big cat interactions on YouTube, and I don't have any in my yard. But I used to volunteer for an exotic animal sanctuary.
[19:51:51] <lall-> https://www.youtube.com/user/oomyfok
[19:52:05] <lall-> this guy. he's posting large cat videos, and it looks like he has them in his ... yard.
[19:52:53] <CuriosTiger> Haven't come across him.
[19:53:11] <CuriosTiger> I'm mildly jeaous, but I wouldn't take on that kind of commitment without a proper facility.
[19:53:16] <CuriosTiger> And I cannot afford a proper facility.
[19:53:26] <lall-> super interesting if you liek large cats. it's not something us urban humans can see in day2day life, which is i guess ... the niche that his channel is in.
[19:53:32] <lall-> hence 1 mil subscribers.
[19:53:53] <CuriosTiger> Many humans, including myself, are fascinated by wildlife and wish we could have a relationship with it somehow

[19:56:14] <CuriosTiger> We didn't have any cutoff date. It was more based on the personality of the animal.
[19:56:25] <CuriosTiger> We had some cats where going in their cage would probably not have ended well.
[19:58:02] <lall-> he had hate mail from people talking crap about the fact that he does what he does.

[19:59:28] <lall-> I'm fascinated by wildlife too, being a village boy... i grew up with variety ofanimals. But that mostly extends to domesticated ones. I don't really support people holding snakes in cages, and such stuff just because they're curious.

[20:01:00] <CuriosTiger> And yeah, haters gonna hate.
[20:01:10] <CuriosTiger> I mean, to be fair, there are some incredibly irresponsible tiger owners out there.
[20:01:39] <CuriosTiger> but there's also a lot of militant PETA activists who are like "all animals should be in the wild...except cats and dogs, because we love them."
[20:01:43] <lall-> This guy genuinely loves these cats. I can understand irresponsible owners such as various oil barrons and similar that hold tigers just because they're rich.
[20:01:53] <CuriosTiger> and if there is no suitable wild to release them into, PETA's stance is that they must kill them for their own good.
[20:02:08] <CuriosTiger> and that really, REALLY pisses me off.
[20:02:19] <CuriosTiger> This guy doesn't seem too bad so far.
[20:02:39] <lall-> fuck peta. Bunch of hypocrites.
[20:02:51] <CuriosTiger> I'm glad we agree.
[20:03:15] <CuriosTiger> What I can say is that I would not have the strong engagement I do for animal welfare if I hadn't had the chance to have that personal connection with animals.
[20:03:28] <CuriosTiger> My volunteering was set off by an interaction with tigers in Thailand.
[20:03:29] <lall-> Friend of mine works for the Chinese gov, he goes to Saudi, Qatar, etc... "lobbying" these sheiks and such to accept chinese gov deals
[20:03:39] <CuriosTiger> one of those tourist sites that let you take a picture with a tiger etc
[20:03:53] <lall-> he sends me videos of them eating food, and under them, is a glass floor... and freaking tigers walking around (the endangered, white ones)
[20:04:15] <CuriosTiger> All tigers are endangered. The white ones are rarer, but breeding them is bad because they are all inbred.
[20:04:21] <lall-> I live in Thailand. The glass story above was in Thailand.
[20:04:31] <CuriosTiger> Basically every white tiger in captivity is descended from a cub named Mohan that was captured in 1952 in India
[20:04:48] <CuriosTiger> Mohan was bred to a normal-colored tigress, but as it turns out, the white coloration is due to a recessive gene.

[20:05:41] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: They're just called yes/no-questions.
[20:05:53] <CuriosTiger> lall-: Do you know where Samut Prakarn is?
[20:06:16] <lall-> I lived in BKK 10 years. Yes, i know where it is. My GF is actually from Samut Prakan.
[20:06:38] <CuriosTiger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samutprakarn_Crocodile_Farm_and_Zoo <-- this was where I got my first interaction with tigers.
[20:06:56] <CuriosTiger> and that's cool.
[20:07:07] <lall-> You ever been to khao khiaow open zoo?
[20:07:12] <CuriosTiger> No
[20:07:26] <lall-> it's a massive land ... with animals running free around, you rent a golf car to move around.
[20:07:40] <lall-> so kind of an open zoo... except tigers and dangerous animals are enclosed.
[20:07:48] <CuriosTiger> Hmm, Si Racha...
[20:08:06] <CuriosTiger> I did go to a zoo there, but I don't think it's the same one. We certainly didn't need any golf carts.
[20:08:25] <lall-> it takes 3-4 hours with a golf cart, in this one.
[20:08:29] <CuriosTiger> Sriracha Tiger Zoo (of course)
[20:08:50] <CuriosTiger> That's cool. We have something somewhat similar here, Lion Country Safari.
[20:09:05] <CuriosTiger> The animals walk free, you stay in your car.
[20:09:07] <lall-> But this is not tiger zoo, this is just a zoo with variety of animals. Problem with tiger zoos is that they drug them often. One of the famous ones in Kanchanaburi got busted
[20:09:16] <CuriosTiger> Of course, the titular lions are now fenced off because some idiots are incapable of staying in their cars.
[20:09:17] <CuriosTiger> https://www.lioncountrysafari.com/
[20:09:25] <lall-> and they closed it down because it got too publicized that they drug the tigers and stuff, so you can pet them.
[20:09:34] <CuriosTiger> lall-: Yeah, I understand. The Tiger Zoo is the only one I've been to in Sri Racha.

[20:10:25] <lall-> oh, it's sad. it's a double edged sword. same thing happens with elephants. The elephants get fed by tourism, and the tourism is also what brings most misery to these creatures.
[20:10:31] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: I've never heard that term before. But I suppose it's possible. "Polar" as in having two poles is a scientific term, but I haven't heard it applied in this context.
[20:10:32] <lall-> So... hard to take a stance there.
[20:10:49] <CuriosTiger> lall-: On my first trip to Thailand, I rode an elephant on Koh Samui.
[20:10:55] <CuriosTiger> He certainly didn't seem drugged.
[20:11:01] <lall-> They don't drug elephants.
[20:11:08] <CuriosTiger> The cool thing about it is that we walked a miles-long trail in the interior of the island.
[20:11:09] <lall-> They separate the female from male, that's how they are tamed.
[20:11:18] <lall-> All the elephants that you can ride, and such, are female ones.
[20:11:28] <CuriosTiger> so we're in the middle of the jungle and you can't tell there's ever been any civilization around
[20:11:36] <CuriosTiger> I even got an elephant shower :P
[20:11:57] <lall-> If the male elephant showed up, he would trample everything around. So there are strict measures how to do this kind of stuff with elephants.
[20:12:05] <CuriosTiger> (that was unplanned, but it was hot and the elephant decided to cool off when we crossed a creek. The mahout was trying to stop him, but I was like, hey, some cool water feels good.)
[20:12:16] <CuriosTiger> Well, male elephants in musth
[20:12:28] *** Parts: StayHungry (~StayHungr@gateway/tor-sasl/stayhungry) (-)
[20:12:32] <CuriosTiger> but yeah, the males can be extremely aggressive.
[20:12:39] <CuriosTiger> I hear they regularly kill people who get in their way.
[20:12:57] <lall-> you know the tsunami thing that happened in i think 2004? Phuket. There were tourists riding elephants, and elephants hasitly started running toward the hills
[20:13:01] <lall-> everybody got freaked out
[20:13:11] <lall-> 3 hours later, they found out ... when they got off the elephants
[20:13:21] <lall-> that the coastal region was all wiped out... 
[20:13:47] <lall-> saved their lives really.
[20:14:10] <lall-> males when paired with females, are super aggressive.
[20:14:17] <CuriosTiger> I do remember the tsunami. My first visit to Thailand was that same year, but a few months earlier

[20:23:12] <lall-> CuriosTiger, i just asked my gf about the plant i talked about
[20:23:34] <lall-> the one that cowers down. She said "maiyarap"... I can't write that on Thai, but quick google showed this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_pudica
[20:23:51] <lall-> > Mimosa pudica (from Latin: pudica "shy, bashful or shrinking"; also called sensitive plant, sleepy plant, action plant,[3] touch-me-not, shameplant[2]) 
[20:24:30] <CuriosTiger> nice
[20:25:34] <lall-> > Due to Mimosa's unique response to touch, it became an ideal plant for many experiments regarding plant habituation and memory.
[20:25:44] <lall-> we never really considered that plants have habits, or memory.
[20:26:08] <lall-> implies higher cognitive function...
[20:26:45] <huf> lall-: I've seen mimosas in hungary multiple times
[20:26:49] <huf> usually in botanical gardens
[20:26:56] <huf> so you could've easily seen and touched some in serbia
[20:27:02] <lall-> i think i did too, but all the plants i saw never responded to touch?
[20:27:16] <lall-> i mean this was instant... just on a touch, it reacted... i never seen that in Serbia.
[20:28:23] <lall-> Maybe you had that experience in Hungary, but I think this type of mimosa is not the type that grews in that part of the word. I guess. If it did, I wouldn't be so mind blown by it.
[20:28:39] <huf> it doesnt grow naturally
[20:28:52] <lall-> >The species is native to the Caribbean and South and Central America, but is now a pantropical weed, and can now be found in the Southern United States, South Asia, East Asia, Micronesia, Australia and South Africa as well. It is not shade tolerant, and is primarily found on soils with low nutrient concentrations.[6]
[20:28:58] <lall-> yeah, so no SE Europe on the list.
[20:30:42] <LuisP14> we call those colloquially in spanish morí viví (literally "i died, i lived" xD )
[20:30:52] <huf> heh
[20:30:54] <LuisP14> in my parts
[20:31:27] <huf> but shameplant is the most twisted fucking thing ever...
[20:31:35] <huf> what kind of obsessed person brought shame into this?!
[20:32:04] <LuisP14> well, the plant seems to be ashamed :3
[20:32:35] <lall-> to me perosnally, it implies that plants have some sort of consciousness. Even the ones that don't move.
[20:32:45] <lall-> but that's ... too far out.
[20:32:54] <huf> they all move, you just have to speed it up
[20:33:13] <huf> on timelapses, plants seem to have purposeful movement and growing
[20:33:15] <lall-> i meant, as action-reaction type of thing. 
[20:33:25] <lall-> on timelapse, they do move, but that's not ... reaction to an action 
[20:33:30] <huf> it is, just slower
[20:33:42] <lall-> other than action of growing and dark/light cycles
[20:33:45] <huf> they react to wind, to shade, to predation
[20:34:08] <huf> some of them find another plant and strangle it
[20:34:18] <huf> that's definitely action-reaction type stuff
[20:34:29] <LuisP14> heh, entanglers
[20:34:41] <lall-> well, same as that oe (i never seen it though), that traps flies in their flowers, or bees or what was it

[23:01:43] <MetaNova> that's not my distinction
[23:01:54] <blkshp> Back to the fact i have 5 bins that go out on a bi-monthly rota.
[23:02:16] <MetaNova> LjL: unclear, since as I am an American, 'rubbish' has never been part of my vocabulary outside of, "that statement is rubbish"
[23:02:34] <lall-> so subjective
[23:02:45] <blkshp> Seperate Food waste; tins,plastics,glass; Garden waste; Cardboard and paper; everything else.
[23:02:54] <MetaNova> blkshp: I like that
[23:03:09] <blkshp> the food goes out weekly, everything else every 2 weeks.
[23:03:15] <lall-> it's not the words, it's the intent behind the words
[23:04:16] <MetaNova> ah, I was a bit off - http://www.differencebetween.net/language/words-language/difference-between-garbage-and-trash
[23:04:27] <blkshp> "rubbish" is any waste.
[23:05:01] <MetaNova> yeah, umbrella term
[23:06:31] <LjL> https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19994/difference-between-garbage-and-trash/20003#20003
[23:06:49] <lall-> people put too much value to certain words, without considering context, it's blowing my mind really

[23:11:19] <lall-> context is all that matters. the other day, i mentioned my friends mum in front of him, he didn't care.... he mentioned mine an hour later. I didn't care. There are no bad words, or good words, there's only bad intentions.
[23:12:01] <lall-> nowdays it seems like you have to walk on tip toes just not to say anthing somebody might interpret as bad.
[23:12:24] <LjL> i'm really unclear on what that has to do with the perceived different meanings of trash, garbage and rubbish
[23:13:07] <lall-> subjective based on whatever subjective is for a person.
[23:13:34] <kurahaupo> LjL: … and waste, and refuse, and detritus, and …
[23:13:39] <LjL> there is information on the web about those differences and while they may sometimes be considered synonyms it's obvious from reading a few things that there are "subjective" differences *that are widespread at least in an area* (everything is subjective about language, but if "trash" consistently evokes different imagery in the minds of people in a given linguistic area than "garbage", then that matters language-wise)

[23:14:52] <MetaNova> well, to be fair, they are not exactly and 100% purely subjective if the distinctions are acted upon, such as by waste collection organizations
[23:15:35] <lall-> all meaning is subjective. we just agree to objectivity
[23:15:44] <lall-> within the framework of the language
[23:15:47] <MetaNova> I mean, yes, they are still arbitrary distinctions, but if they have actual impact on your life/activities ..
[23:15:53] <lall-> which changes, from time to time.
[23:16:01] <kurahaupo> The trash compactor aboard the death star in star wars was by all accounts quite pungent, so obviously the empire includes organic matter in the definition of "trash"
[23:16:25] <LjL> MetaNova, i found some stuff stating that historically trash was burned, garbage was given to pigs or whatnot
[23:16:40] <MetaNova> that makes a lot of sense
[23:16:42] *** Quits: Nimue (sid194105@user/nimue) (Quit: Exile.)
[23:16:58] <LjL> as in, "my grandparents had two piles, trash and garbage, the one got burned..."
[23:17:02] <kurahaupo> rubbish vs compost vs recycling
[23:17:20] *** Joins: Nimue (sid194105@user/nimue)
[23:17:23] <LjL> so it's possible that those terms had specific "recycling" meanings in the past that are no longer very relevant today but have left a legacy of subtle difference
[23:17:50] <kurahaupo> Old cars don't burn easily, and I doubt the pigs will derive much nutrition from them
[23:18:14] <lall-> pigs can eat plastic though. Just look at Wartburg cars.
[23:18:24] <kurahaupo> Maybe the yeast can eat the tires
[23:18:25] <lall-> there are songs about pigs eating warburg cars.

[23:31:44] <bin> I'm in the US and I wouldn't be surprised by "rubbish bin" and I myself say "bin" sometimes because, despite being the same number of syllables, it's slightly less effort to say that "trash".
[23:32:37] <bin> I've never heard a distinction between trash and garbage, personally
[23:32:50] <bin> other than garbage has a different connotation as like festering
[23:32:57] <bin> but otherwise they're interchangeable mostly
[23:33:17] <bin> "Ugh that is broken, it's garbage" is the same as "ugh that is broken, it's trash"
[23:33:48] <blkshp> Thomas A Anderson, programmer, you go to work, you pay your taxes, you help your landlady out with her... garbage
[23:34:07] <blkshp> Your other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo
[23:34:24] <blkshp> One of these lives has a future, the other does not!
[23:37:37] <bin> ^ straight facts.
[23:39:47] <lall-> the distinction is imaginary
[23:40:05] <lall-> and none of them ave future.
[23:40:24] <lall-> oh. uhm. sorry. did i say that out loud?
[23:41:04] * lall- goes back watching Rick and Morty.
[23:47:05] <lall-> kurahaupo, may be, but, in all seriosusness.. if you had this car: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1990-0404-423%2C_Pkw_Wartburg_1.3.jpg and a pig sty next to it. chances are you would never see the chassis of your car again.
[23:47:29] <lall-> well, body work anyway.
