[02:43:18] <teut> np
[02:43:26] <theskillwithin> ahh i missed that
[02:43:50] <teut> now what i think is that , the form gets submitted before
[02:44:13] <teut> I need to set the action based on this button click

[02:44:42] <teut> hmm, ok, I dont like that preventdefault
[02:44:52] <teut> is there anyway without it
[02:44:52] <teut> ?
[02:44:59] <jaawerth> that's how you stop the native form action. what's not to like?
[02:45:11] <jaawerth> you either want the native action to occur or not
[02:45:39] <teut> doesnt the submit occurs after the listener detects the click?

[02:48:50] <theskillwithin> but ya like jaawerth is trying to say.  usually you do like event.preventDefault()  to prevent the submit action,   or have type="button" on the button i guess.  but if ur trying to submit on this click as well then its kind of a race condition in the logic
[02:49:12] <theskillwithin> so you might have the wrong approach but not sure, ill let u get to ur next problem
[02:50:17] <teut> i think i reada it in some docs that  the event listener is hit first
[02:50:43] <teut> and its all single threaded so no race consitions

[06:26:43] <ThePendulum> hm how do I run javascript from the url bar in firefox without redirecting to its output
[06:29:30] <theskillwithin> huh?
[06:30:05] <theskillwithin> like javascript:
[06:32:00] <theskillwithin> wait that isn't a thing anymore i guess
[06:32:08] <ThePendulum> yeah but it redirects me to a page of commas if I put javascript:Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.clickable'), el => el.click())
[06:35:25] <theskillwithin> for me does nothing
[06:35:39] <theskillwithin> make sure its not just autofilling to google search
[06:35:41] <ThePendulum> weird, idk why it redirects then. if it doesn't find .clickable it just puts a blank page
[06:36:06] <theskillwithin> i tried javascript:alert('hi');   did nothing
[06:36:14] <ThePendulum> hmm it might be a quirk of private mode
[06:36:45] <ThePendulum> nope, hmm
[06:36:52] <theskillwithin> and by nothing, i mean nothing
[06:36:59] <theskillwithin> what's it supposed to do
[06:37:02] <ThePendulum> yeah alert doesn't do anything either
[06:37:09] <ThePendulum> it's supposed to open a bunch of links on a page, it works fine in chrome

[08:19:44] <theskillwithin> ü§ò
[08:20:15] <wroathe> I do not enjoy hackathons.
[08:20:30] <rustyshackleford> wroathe: yeah I'm with you
[08:20:48] <rustyshackleford> but my director voluntold me to do it so, what are ya gonna do?
[08:21:06] <theskillwithin> LOL volentold
[08:21:13] <rustyshackleford> it was actually pretty fun. we *almost* have it working
[08:21:37] <wroathe> Was the subject of the hackathon work related?
[08:21:47] <rustyshackleford> wroathe: yup
[08:21:47] <wroathe> Or did you get to pick your project
[08:21:53] <wroathe> Well, then fuck that.
[08:22:03] <rustyshackleford> well you get to pick your project. But the idea is pretty cool
[08:22:27] <rustyshackleford> one of the hardest things about this event is picking your idea
[08:22:41] <theskillwithin> anything in the direction of giving power to the team, i like
[08:22:41] <rustyshackleford> its gotta be small enough to get something cool to demo
[08:22:44] <wroathe> But that idea has to be work related, right? Like something for your ongoing projects?
[08:23:28] <rustyshackleford> wroathe: not necessarily ongoing
[08:23:33] <wroathe> You couldn't just decide to implement Earthworm Jim in WebGL?
[08:23:59] <rustyshackleford> they're offering 1000 bucks for the winner
[08:24:09] <rustyshackleford> for each person on the winning team that is
[08:24:16] <theskillwithin> 400 after taxes
[08:24:32] <rustyshackleford> yeah its also in gift cards haha
[08:24:36] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: On top of your normal hourly rate for the time you spent hacking?
[08:24:46] <rustyshackleford> lmao hourly
[08:25:08] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: Well, whatever your salary works out to. You were compensated, right? Beyond the reward?
[08:25:23] <rustyshackleford> I still got paid today yeah
[08:25:27] <rustyshackleford> its during work hours
[08:25:35] <wroathe> Oh, good. Nevermind then.
[08:25:44] <rustyshackleford> well we worked extra of course
[08:26:04] <rustyshackleford> but I'm salaried. I get paid for today
[08:26:08] <theskillwithin> well idk thats how salary works sometimes,  sometimes down times, sometimes super hardcore times, it balences out
[08:26:28] <rustyshackleford> it was fun, I ain't complaining
[08:26:31] <wroathe> Usually hackathons scoped to work related projects are just ways middle management tries to get the young developers to work for pizza and beer, and avoid paying them
[08:26:50] <theskillwithin> iv never been to a hackaton
[08:26:55] <rustyshackleford> wroathe: there is some level of that
[08:27:22] <theskillwithin> i used to like making meetups, and provide pizza and beer for that
[08:27:54] <rustyshackleford> meetups could be cool

[08:28:44] <rustyshackleford> I think something like 300
[08:28:58] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: Ok, and how many hours extra did you work?
[08:29:06] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: And what's the average team size?

[08:30:20] <Rockwood> whiskey shops are opened here now
[08:30:22] <Rockwood> lol
[08:30:31] <Rockwood> but i started with beers
[08:30:50] <wroathe> Ok, at 2 hours extra that's 300 * 5 = 1500 man hours, and if you assume an average of $50/hr converted from salary that comes out to $75,000 in free labor
[08:30:55] <Rockwood> 13 beers were consumed
[08:31:10] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: And worst case it costs them 5000 for the prize for a 5 person team, and pizza and beer
[08:31:31] <rustyshackleford> wroathe: most of us are remote. so no pizza and beer
[08:31:39] <rustyshackleford> they sent us some "swag"
[08:32:02] <rustyshackleford> so a $40 √ºber eats gift certificate, a water bottle, and a shirt. sweet, right?
[08:32:32] <wroathe> rustyshackleford: They should be running hackathons weekly. $70k a pop is serious cash
[08:32:58] <rustyshackleford> management seems to think that if we just say that we are innovators, it will be true
[08:33:05] <rustyshackleford> bruh, we're just like google
[08:33:12] <rustyshackleford> srsly
[08:33:21] <wroathe> No, management teams are very aware of this math that I just did.
[08:33:39] <theskillwithin> idk if your paid a good salary, sometimes put up with bs

[16:02:59] <nwoob> I am saving time in DB in UTC format, but UTC time can vary depending on client timezone. So suppose user does an activity and send activity startDate and endDate to client in UTC format
[16:03:49] <systemfault> That's the whole point of UTC, it doesn't vary.
[16:04:03] <nwoob> now user moves to different timezone and gives call to server to fetch all activities done on 11th

[16:05:56] <ThePendulum> new Date does most of the heavy lifting for you if you give it a UTC string
[16:07:13] <ThePendulum> of course it begs the question whether when your user sets an activity for 7am for something they're going to do in New York while they're in Amsterdam, do they mean NY time or central european time
[16:07:38] <nwoob> suppose I do an activity at 11th June in Asia/calcuta timezone and converts to UTC it becomes 2021-06-11T19:23:12.340698Z and save it to DB
[16:08:15] <nwoob> *12th June
[16:09:39] <systemfault> Yes, then you can take that iso date and create a localized Date object from it.
[16:09:45] <nwoob> Now I move to some US timezone and want to see activity done on 12th June, but activity was save with respect to IST and server might now give proper result

[16:56:15] <MaxFury> can someone take a look and tell me what I am doing wrong?
[16:56:15] <MaxFury> https://jsfiddle.net/xwmco16r/
[16:56:42] <MaxFury> My intention is that when I click on the top row, the hidden class should be added to the bottom two rows
[16:57:37] <systemfault> Well, it complains that jQuery is not loaded? Is it just for the fiddle or it also does that in your code/
[16:57:59] <systemfault> (Also.. children is a global variable in that code)
[16:58:30] <systemfault> Not sure I understand that weird mix of jQuery and normal DOM
[16:58:37] <systemfault> Pick one already... :/
[16:58:40] <MaxFury> ...
[16:59:18] <entuland> yep, unless you know you have to use jQuery because it's there for you already (in your real project), don't use it
[16:59:22] <MaxFury> systemfault, you can choose Javascript + JQuery
[16:59:27] <MaxFury> in the language below
[16:59:33] <systemfault> Yes... but in that case, it's beyond stupid.
[16:59:41] <MaxFury> entuland, yes I have to use it
[16:59:57] <systemfault> You're doing node lookups using DOM... but adding classes with jQuery
[17:00:13] <MaxFury> does that make me a genius?
[17:00:13] <systemfault> There's also that "children" global variable..
[17:00:19] <entuland> then set your fiddle up so that it uses jQuery and test it in a new window as if you were the recipient of the fiddle
[17:00:20] <systemfault> Kind of the opposite.
[17:00:27] <entuland> then share the link again
[17:00:40] <MaxFury> what's wrong with the children variable>
[17:00:55] <systemfault> There's a missing "var/let/const" keyword when you declare it.
[17:01:09] <entuland> make that only "let/const" - var shouldn't be used anymore
[17:01:12] <systemfault> And because you're not using the "strict mode" as you should, it creates a global variable.
[17:01:21] <MaxFury> https://jsfiddle.net/xwmco16r/1/
[17:01:46] <MaxFury> but it should still work shouldn't it
[17:01:47] <entuland> okay, now your fiddle runs
[17:01:54] <entuland> what do you expect to happen there when you click?
[17:02:00] <entuland> (cause it's running)
[17:02:01] <systemfault> MaxFury: What is the expected result? ( I get "true" )
[17:02:21] <MaxFury> systemfault, the two bottom rows should hide when I click on the top row
[17:02:33] <entuland> you understand that adding "hidden" class per se does nothing unless your CSS does something with that class, yes?
[17:02:53] <entuland> there is no CSS there saying that elements with hidden class should be hidden
[17:03:03] <MaxFury> and it shows true for the bottom rows has class hidden property, which is clearly not true because if it were, they would hide
[17:03:22] <entuland> try this: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/8uyg6zh5/
[17:03:30] <entuland> you are missing the point
[17:03:33] <entuland> the class is being added
[17:03:40] <entuland> you just aren't telling CSS what to do with that class
[17:03:40] <MaxFury> nice
[17:03:54] <MaxFury> I am new to this, please bear with me
[17:04:03] <entuland> sure, please read up on the basics of CSS
[17:04:08] <entuland> classes per se do nothing
[17:04:12] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[17:04:19] <MaxFury> so I should probably use pure js to do this

[17:05:21] <entuland> all of what jQuery does can be done with pure JS

[19:55:43] <onizu> DAMN, earlier it was $('.deleteComment').click(function() {        confirmDeletion();    });
[19:55:56] <entuland> you should really use a paste site and not paste code here
[19:56:12] <entuland> better yet if you use the fiddle with a minimal working sample
[19:56:27] <onizu> entuland: I changed the event to submit() and passed the event to confirmDeletion() and there for the failing condition, added event.preventDefault(), works now
[19:56:35] <entuland> good
[19:56:58] <onizu> this was an old code and used to work before.. dunno what happened now
[19:57:00] <onizu> anyways
[19:57:28] <entuland> can't tell, stopped using jQuery a long time ago

[22:01:13] <teut> how to reset vscode's keybindings?
[22:01:23] <teut> some extension fucked up the keyboard
[22:02:13] <GreenJello> try uninstalling the extension?
[22:02:26] <GreenJello> it'd be super weird for it to change the key binds persistently
[22:02:29] <teut> I did , but it remains
[22:03:14] <teut> ctrl c wasnt working first of all, then I manually reset ed it  , then  now the "k"  comments the whole line
[22:03:23] <GreenJello> Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON) in the command palette
[22:03:24] <teut> I reinstalled vscode but that didnt fixed
[22:03:36] <entuland> there should be an option to reset the bindings to the defaults
[22:04:01] <entuland> and your customizations are likely saved where a reinstall won't make any difference (settings files somewhere else or registry)
[22:04:32] <teut> should I just delete everything from it?
[22:04:33] <Rockwood> entuland, hi
[22:04:48] <Rockwood> dammit beers makes me crazy
[22:04:52] <GreenJello> everything you don't want
[22:05:01] <teut> fixing each key combination would be quite difficult
[22:05:02] <entuland> something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56342651
[22:05:08] <entuland> hey there Rockwood
[22:05:22] <entuland> stop boozing, Rockwood :P
[22:05:25] <GreenJello> if you delete an entry then it'll revert to the default
[22:05:45] <teut> actually there was an update today too, I dont know    what caused it
[22:05:55] <Rockwood> entuland, once you remember you explained about carcinoma report of my father
[22:05:56] <teut> the update or extension,
[22:06:16] <Rockwood> entuland, we was in PHP channel
[22:06:39] <entuland> I must have forgotten, been away from IRC for a long time
[22:07:03] <Rockwood> entuland, you know _adrian
[22:07:05] <Rockwood> ??
[22:07:13] <Rockwood> in php
[22:07:31] <entuland> can I send you a PM Rockwood?
[22:07:37] <Rockwood> sure
[22:07:39] <entuland> k
[22:08:03] <teut> GreenJello that says cannot delete read only mode
[22:08:55] <teut> entuland , that gave a big list and right clicking does give an option to reset but , I just use the default from the start , I have made no changes t o default
[22:09:17] <teut> so reseting each one is tough
[22:09:30] <teut> I just need "reset all"
[22:09:51] <teut> I cleared the %Appdata%  but nothing worked
[22:09:55] <entuland> sorry, I have a thing with visual studio stuff
[22:10:14] <entuland> as in, tried them a while ago, realized I couldn't uninstall them no matter what, gave up
[22:10:34] <entuland> _properly_ uninstall, as if they left tendrils here and there
[22:10:41] <teut> any good suggestions to switch to?
[22:10:49] <entuland> sure, Notepad++
[22:10:50] <entuland>  :P
[22:11:05] <teut> -_-
[22:11:09] <Rockwood> our JS code always visible and not secure
[22:11:09] <entuland> ehehe, sorry
[22:11:30] <Rockwood> :D
[22:11:34] <Rockwood> wht?
[22:11:49] <teut> vscode actually has that language server thing, others dont
[22:11:57] <teut> so it 's a unique product
[22:12:02] <GreenJello> making frontend code secret wouldn't improve security
[22:12:34] <entuland> how do you even make frontend code secret?
[22:12:57] <entuland> once it gets to run on the client, there is no secrecy whatsoever if one really wants to dissect
[22:13:00] <teut> that only the browsers can do
[22:13:01] <GreenJello> you move the sensitive logic to the backend
[22:13:07] <entuland> ^ that
[22:13:37] <GreenJello> no, browsers can't do that because someone could use a different browser, or a script
[22:13:55] <teut> i mean if they hide the inspector
[22:14:10] <GreenJello> then you don't use that browser when you want to view the code
[22:15:03] <GreenJello> it just inconveniences the user, and browsers serve the user, not the website
[22:15:39] <teut> ok, then just to keep in mind that frontend is just the view,  data needs to cleaned very well on the server
[22:16:02] <Rockwood> GreenJello, hi how are you and good night
[22:16:23] <entuland> I'm a bit lost as to how we switched from visual studio to obfuscating client side JS code - there is nothing in web development that forces you to use visual studio
[22:16:37] <entuland> I seriously only use Notepad++ to edit my code

[22:25:56] <doc> Doesn't matter to me, I've a syncing setup for my machines
[22:26:19] <MaxFury> i use bitwarden too because i use only the very best of the best
[22:26:20] <devslash> does bitwaren sync with your own devices or does it have a central server like lastpass
[22:26:24] <MaxFury> since i deserve the best
[22:26:55] <devslash> MaxFury, you sound like someone who would like like at themselves in the mirror while jackin it....
[22:26:57] <KevinX_> bitwarden's website says unlimited items
[22:27:02] <MaxFury> devslash, you deserve the best answer to that question so i can't help you with that
[22:27:08] <devslash> thanks I appreciate it ;)

[22:27:56] <devslash> yea but thats not what I am asking....
[22:27:56] <KevinX_> no I dont self-host
[22:28:05] <devslash> does bitwareden let you do that

[22:28:28] <KevinX_> self host? it says it right under the last item i quoted
[22:28:46] <KevinX_> "Self-host Option"
[22:29:09] <devslash> yes am i understanding it correctly that you cannot self host
[22:29:13] <devslash> with the free plan ?
[22:29:27] <MaxFury> why get free when you can pay for it?
[22:29:48] <devslash> because I want to try it out first but i wont if i cant do it with self hosting
[22:29:56] <KevinX_> it says on their pricing page you can self host with free
[22:29:58] <devslash> if i cant self host then im not interested

[22:30:57] <wroathe> MaxFury: You're looping through the table rows twice on one event
[22:31:36] <MaxFury> wroathe, but how?
[22:31:48] <wroathe> MaxFury: The first time it hits collapseChildrenAccounts it will hide all of the lol rows, and then return back to the outer loop in fetchChildrenAccounts, where it shows them again
[22:32:09] <wroathe> MaxFury: Because it hasn't finished the loop in fetchChildrenAccounts before you iterate through the rows in collapseChildrenAccounts
[22:32:55] <wroathe> MaxFury: So it 1. starts looping in fetch, 2. iterates through and hides in collapseChildrenAccounts, and 3. continues the loop in fetch where it sees that there are now rows that are hidden, and toggles them back to visible
[22:33:03] <devslash> MaxFury,  it supports webdav sync right ?
[22:33:04] <MaxFury> wroathe, but why does it hide the first row?
[22:33:39] <wroathe> MaxFury: It doesn't. Comment out line 6 and run it
[22:34:11] <MaxFury> I mean lol2
[22:34:23] <MaxFury> shouldn't lol2 also be visible?
[22:34:44] <wroathe> MaxFury: Because the outer loop has already visited lol2 by the time collapseChildrenAccounts is called
[22:34:54] <MaxFury> thanks a lot btw, I know you're right
[22:35:08] <MaxFury> Yeah I get it now
[22:35:25] <MaxFury> It's going to  be hard to fix this
[22:35:35] <wroathe> MaxFury: Quite easy, really
[22:35:53] <MaxFury> wroathe, can you give me a hint?
[22:36:10] <wroathe> MaxFury: You don't need collapseChildrenAccounts
[22:36:40] <wroathe> MaxFury: https://jsfiddle.net/j64u8712/
[22:36:47] <MaxFury> wroathe, actually I made that because I was using that to recursively collapse more children
[22:37:35] <wroathe> MaxFury: Well, you'll probably want to post the recursive case in a fiddle too and get help with that. I'm heading out to the gym.
[22:37:50] <MaxFury> ok thanks a lot
[22:38:04] <wroathe> MaxFury: There's other stuff wrong with this code too. For one, you should prefer display: none over the hidden property, and you should prefer addEventListener over the onclick attribute
[22:38:21] <wroathe> MaxFury: And you should prefer querySelector over getElementsByClassName, and you should prefer const or let over var
[22:38:26] <teut> when you submit a form, the request is received on the server and it contains the queryparameters of the action and its the post data , is there any way to know which url actually posted that data?
[22:38:30] <MaxFury> ok
[22:38:31] <wroathe> MaxFury: And the parenthesis on line 2 are unnecessary

[23:01:08] <rustyshackleford> how common or uncommon are SOAP services these days/
[23:01:53] *** Joins: summersault (~summersau@2804:7f0:3886:c810:155e:8f76:57c2:f49c)
[23:02:37] <gehn> rustyshackleford, surely common enough
[23:02:52] <gehn> rustyshackleford, I would hope that most places don't build new stuff on SOAP, but there's plenty of SOAP in the world already
[23:03:25] <rustyshackleford> now I wonder who is building new SOAP services
[23:04:15] <rustyshackleford> was it something like the GraphQL of yesterday?
[23:04:32] <gehn> a little bit, yes
[23:04:37] <gehn> more implications than that
[23:05:26] <gehn> SOAP can be convenient if your goal is to build a full in language API, i.e. if you want to do code generation to autogenerate like thousands of classes which effectively call your API on behalf of your users
[23:05:39] <gehn> and esp for statically typed languages like Java
[23:06:02] <rustyshackleford> is it inherently linked to java?
[23:06:06] <gehn> no
[23:06:09] <gehn> so then you can call say, BlogPosts.API.Search()
[23:06:21] <gehn> and you can get back an officially statically typed BlogPost class instance
[23:06:27] <gehn> or, you know, list of them I guess in this case
[23:06:45] <rustyshackleford> the response contains the directions for how to deserialize this data basically

[23:08:54] <gehn> anyway, that's the use case of SOAP, more or less. SOAP has been obviated by the fact that XML sucks and JSON is better, also now we have standards like Swagger and OpenAPI

[23:10:34] <rustyshackleford> I see what you mean. The SOAP format or whatever bakes the contract into the system
[23:11:02] <rustyshackleford> where REST would require you to publish some kind of document
[23:11:24] <Deide> Would you prefer a JSON format for HTML?

[23:12:48] <Deide> Would internet document markup be nicer in something like JSON?
[23:13:22] <g0z> the heck is internet document mark up?
[23:13:29] <Deide> HTML
[23:13:47] <gehn> the H stands for internet
[23:13:53] <gehn> it's a silent H
[23:13:54] <g0z> ah, french.
[23:15:20] <gehn> I don't think JSON for DOM would really be that much worse, possibly better in some ways, possibly not as nice in some ways
[23:15:34] <gehn> like, the DOM kind of is a JSON like structure in the first place
[23:16:14] <gehn> it'd be the difference between { "tag": "input", "name": "credit_card": } and <input name="credit_card">
[23:16:36] <gehn> the former being effectively what you're manipulating in JS anyway, the latter being a bit more succinct and readable
[23:16:41] <Deide> Yeah, I've often wondered about it myself - particularly when JSON started gaining popularity and we had stuff like "XMLHttpRequest"
[23:18:42] <Deide> Though to have children, it would be more like `{ "tag": "div", "children": [{ "tag": "input", "name": "credit_card" }]}`

[23:21:34] <rustyshackleford> its pretty verbose compared to html but maybe that would be a good thing
