[04:46:10] <mst> humanity is fascinating
[04:47:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> cf. Masha Gessen's review of "Chernobyl" where she points out that all the scenes where the Party boss dude (i.e. Stellan Skarsgard's character) is all like "do <thing> or I have you shot" are unrealistic, because in the Soviet Union pretty much nobody needed to be threatened, people just did what they were told
[04:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is then additionally ironic because Chernobyl was one of the major catalysts for the collapse of that system and those social dynamics)
[04:49:11] <mst> it's not actually hard to burn a -lot- of credibility at once if you fuck something up badly enough
[04:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, there's that, and also of course the fact that people trusted the government in large part because they didn't know... a lot of things, and then glasnost and ... well, suddenly everyone found out all of those things and it turned out that whoops, our whole lives were a lie!
[04:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (By the way, the specific way in which "people in Russia distrust the government" manifests in the current situation is "vaccines have Western-produced ingredients, which contain nanobots that the evil Americans are gonna use to spy on us and control our minds, and our cucked government isn't stopping this")

[05:03:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 1997, Frank Dux, the martial artist whom Van Damme portrayed in Bloodsport, filed a lawsuit against Van Damme for $50,000 for co-writing and consultation work Dux did on the 1996 film The Quest. According to the lawsuit, Dux also accused Van Damme of lying to the public about his martial arts fight record, stating that when Dux tutored Van Damme while Van Damme was laying carpet for a living, Van Damme exhibited a lack of
[05:03:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  martial arts skills. Van Damme's lawyer, Martin Singer, responded, "There are records to document his martial arts acclaim. Why, just look at his movies; he didn't get those roles on his acting ability! He's the one who does those splits on chairs. He doesn't have a stuntman to do that."[78]" ... ouch
[05:04:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's quite a defense. "My client is so obviously a shit actor that this proves he can do martial arts, because why else would anyone hire him to be in movies"

[07:48:04] <gwern> (episode 29 of _shirokuma cafe_ is unexpectedly sad. it's about Penguin envying the birds and wanting  to fly. eventually his friends rig up a basket to lift him into the trees to look out over the town and imagine he's flying, with a very wistful soundtrack. then they forget to take him down when they get drinks after their hard work.)

[11:03:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This was the one where I ate bugs and got a t-shirt for it)
[11:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The new keyboard and mouse aren’t perfect, however. The biggest problem with the mouse is that it still uses a single button. I have larger issues with the Pro Keyboard. Although the keyboard looks like an Apple Extended Keyboard, it still has the mushy keys of the keyboard that debuted with the iMac. I use one of these keyboards at work and have noticed that key presses don’t always register. It seems like you need to
[11:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  press each key a certain way or it won’t work. If Apple has fixed this in the Pro Keyboard, then I might be able to live with the mushiness of the keys. If not, I will continue to use my third-party keyboard."
[11:04:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Spoiler: Apple did not fix this in the Pro keyboard)
[11:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "No doubt, the Cube looks beautiful, but I sincerely wonder who it is aimed at. At $1799 for the 450 MHz model and $2299 for the 500 MHz model, it comes close to the price range of the higher-end G4s. Perhaps Apple’s plans will become clearer as we get closer to the Cube’s September release date."
[11:04:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Spoiler: Apple's plans did not become clearer)
[11:06:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It used to be the case that companies would give you a T-shirt or something for coming within five feet of their booths. This year, companies were much more frugal. At first, Ambrosia would only give you a shirt if you ate a bug." ... HAH!!!
[11:06:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bullshit!

[12:10:07] <feep[work]> I need to write a blogpost
[12:10:11] <feep[work]> "JSON-RPC is broken"
[12:15:16] <mst> welcome to 2005?
[12:17:00] <feep[work]> mst: I mean, it's broken in a particular way that I don't think is documented
[12:17:45] <feep[work]> mst: tl;dr notifications fundamentally cannot allow backpressure while sharing a connection with request acknowledgements; the lack of an acknowledge/reject mechanism forces us to buffer an unbounded amount
[12:18:21] <feep[work]> it's not per se a jsonrpc issue; any protocool that allows sending notifications without a rejection mechanism will face the same issue
[12:18:26] <feep[work]> -o
[12:19:41] <energizer> feep[work]: what happens if you do the rejection at the transport layer instead, eg returning http 503
[12:19:53] <feep[work]> energizer: json-rpc builds on tcp, not http
[12:20:18] <energizer> what am i looking at? http://www.simple-is-better.org/json-rpc/transport_http.html
[12:20:19] <Robomot> simple is better - JSON-RPC 2.0 Transport: HTTP
[12:20:20] <feep[work]> I'm not sure if http/2 has the same problem with push notifications, reading up on that rn
[12:20:24] <feep[work]> I know that http/3 doesn't
[12:20:36] <feep[work]> energizer: oyeah we're using a tcp transport, sorry
[12:20:44] <feep[work]> I forgot this proto is transport agnostic
[12:20:59] <feep[work]> it depends on whether the jsonrpc server interprets 503 as a session failure
[12:22:36] <feep[work]> or in general how it multiplexes things

[12:29:42] <Robomot> Seeking Questions: Be More Evil (Spoiler warning: significant spoilers for Avengers: Age of Ultron.   The Road to Hell   Everyone thinks of themselves as a hero of the stor... …)
[12:30:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> This post overall maybe is correct or interesting, or not, I don't care, BUT it made me think (again) of something that occurred to me recently while I was being angry at things people were doing in my WoW raid
[12:31:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So this blog post is like "heroes don't make plans, etc." - true, yes, that's a trend
[12:31:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But
[12:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's perhaps less a "heroes" thing and more a... cultural thin
[12:31:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> g
[12:31:56] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, but hang on
[12:32:14] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: avengers infinity war and endgame 1. have the heroes making a plan
[12:32:17] <feep[work]> 2. have a heist story
[12:32:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I believe you but even if that's true, this guy's point is overall correct
[12:33:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> If there's a movie that's an exception, cool, but doesn't meaningfully detract from the point
[12:33:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[12:34:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's this scene in _The Hunt for Red October_ where Jack Ryan is explaining to Admiral Painter his theory about how Captain Ramius is intending to defect to the West, along with his ship (the titular submarine), and they have this exchange:
[12:34:56] *** Joins: bananajoe (~bananajoe@93-44-188-190.ip98.fastwebnet.it)
[12:35:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> PAINTER: What's his plan?   RYAN: His plan, sir...?   PAINTER: Russians don't take a dump without a plan.
[12:36:18] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@5.77.170.170) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[12:36:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, that's funny, about the Russians, right, but what it obviously implies is that *Americans*, in contrast, do in fact regularly do all sorts of shit without any plan (and this is supported by the fact that it did not occur to (CIA analyst!) Jack Ryan that Ramius would, much less *necessarily must*, have a specific plan)
[12:38:28] <kuudes> yes
[12:39:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's totally a real thing - a genuine cultural difference! (For another example, my mother regularly complains about her American coworkers, almost to a man/woman, having this inexplicable failing that they simply do not "think two steps head" in any circumstance; she regularly has conversations like "we should do X!" "but if we did X, wouldn't Y happen? and wouldn't Z therefore result?" "... I didn't think of that")
[12:40:39] <feep[work]> that's kind of depressing
[12:40:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Only with the Americans, mind you! Not the Russians, not the Indians, not the Nigerians/Egyptians/Chinese/anyone)
[12:42:28] <dv^_^> Must be all the HFCS
[12:42:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Could be, could be
[12:44:57] <feep[work]> also of course the mission impossible series is structured as a series of (borderline identical) good guy heists
[12:45:02] <feep[work]> sneakers: good guy heist
[12:45:34] <feep[work]> james bond, arguably sometimes
[12:46:32] <feep[work]> lots of great action movies have good guy plans, is my point.
[12:47:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah the thing about heists is that even if the protagonists are (arguably or actually) good guys, it's still a very circumscribed format that boils down to "do this complicated transgression of the rules"
[12:47:12] <feep[work]> true, true.
[12:47:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's almost definitionally not *constructive*
[12:47:26] <feep[work]> yeah it's "attack the fortress"
[12:47:49] <feep[work]> not sure what media have "build the fortress" - minecraft?
[12:48:02] <feep[work]> factorio
[12:48:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know? It's not at all equivalent to where the bad guy is like "I'm gonna build a secret volcano lair", even, much less "I will re-mould society according to my will"
[12:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But of course once I put it *that* way, a *very* obvious example occurs to me!)
[12:48:28] <feep[work]> right but the problem is that plans become increasingly illegible the more structural they are
[12:48:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That being: Andromeda)
[12:48:46] <feep[work]> hard to get visual spectacle from societal transformation
[12:49:18] <PlanckWalk> Well, there was a Dr Who episode where the bad guy transformed the world population into copies of himself...
[12:49:38] <feep[work]> PlanckWalk: yes, that's the point, only bad guys are allowed to be transformative
[12:49:44] <feep[work]> because transformation must be opposed
[12:49:49] <PlanckWalk> Ah yes, fair point
[12:49:51] <feep[work]> .trope status quo is god
[12:49:55] <feepbot> feep[work]: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod
[12:50:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course Andromeda was sort of the exception that proved that rule
[12:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dylan Hunt was unquestionably a good guy and doing a transformative thing, BUT his aim was *restoring* a destroyed order
[12:50:44] <feep[work]> harry potter
[12:50:49] <feep[work]> is actually pretty constructive
[12:50:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, how's that
[12:51:01] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, the closest thing I could find to transforming a society was restoring a previous one :-(
[12:51:22] <PlanckWalk> (But that previous one was frankly pretty crappy too)
[12:51:23] <feep[work]> well, not in every movie, but from the first movie on harry takes proactive steps to investigate a crisis that nobody else even *notices*.
[12:51:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> eh

[18:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Without the market’s demands and the accompanying dictates that stifle creativity in favor of profitability, TTRPGs could have been part of the public domain, with gamers free to build and expand on whatever ideas they wanted, either their own or ones drawn from other sources.

And as of january of this year according to official chinese state statistics, china was the fastest aging society in human history with the largest sex imbalance in human 
[19:29:59] <two2thehead> history. they had aged past the point that they could even theoretically maintain their population its current size into the future. they had run out of people of childbearing age. by 2100 there will be half as many chinese as there are today. and then in april they started to release details from their 10-year census, and they realized that they had been over counting their population for some time and that 2100 date for half as many people was 
[19:29:59] <two2thehead> moved forward to 2070.  as of last month early october some of this data has been broken down by some chinese academics and demographers, and they're like we fear we need more data but we fear that that half date is now moved up to 2050. and for that to be true the chinese would have over counted their population by a hundred million, and all of that hundred million would be people who would be theoretically born since one child so age 35 and 
[19:30:05] <two2thehead> under. in which case china peaked in terms of its population not two years ago like they were originally thinking 15 years ago, and we've already seen a 12-fold increase in chinese labor costs since 1999 so it tracks with the economic data. So china is not getting rich it's getting old. They are no longer the low-cost producer, and they haven't advanced enough to become a high-quality producer so from a purely economic point of view even if the us

What's more, that ramp up in career and prime age labour force participation lines up exactly with having kids. So young people face a great cliff of expectation and responsibility. No wonder everyone is afraid of adulthood. One more angle on this is how it hits the upper middle class particularly hard.
