[13:51:28] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[13:59:26] <gahr> I haven't been able to crash imap with mx-enough-mem 
[13:59:44] <gahr> but I don't think I have the guts to refactor more the header parsing code, at least now
[14:00:42] <flatcap> ok :-)
[14:00:59] <gahr> my brain isn't up to understanding how hcache, qresync, condstore, and plain ol'imap play together :/
[14:01:57] <flatcap> hmm... tricky
[14:04:25] <flatcap> could you look at the upstream patches in [flatcap/qresync]?
[14:04:41] <flatcap> there are 9 of them and they're all fairly small
[14:05:55] <flatcap> I started trying to apply them, but in ignorance
[14:25:35] <gahr> I can try to do the same :)
[14:27:19] <flatcap> thanks!
[14:28:52] <gahr> how do you do the upstream-commit and co-authored-by things? manually?
[14:29:11] <gahr> ah, you probably git-apply the patches file and adjust any conflicts?
[14:31:13] <flatcap> yeah, I manually tweak the headers and then manually fix the conflicts
[14:31:57] <gahr> sounds like fun
[14:32:23] <gahr> I'll work on a new branch of mine, we can sync with flatcap/qresync later if needed
[14:32:33] <flatcap> one of the first things I do it check that the patches are applying against the right files. I've probably already done that for those patches
[14:33:00] <flatcap> hehe, it's slow work, but satisfying when it compiles :-)
[14:33:30] <flatcap> if my branch is any use, great, if not, no worries

[14:43:48] <gahr> are you finished with the query/alias fixes?
[14:44:08] <gahr> (bw, some of those qresync patches are already on master)
[14:44:17] <flatcap> they're ok, but dcpurton's found a problem with $auto_tag (which I'm working on)
[14:44:40] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commits/1ad3119d96
[14:44:46] <flatcap> I've got a quick fix for the index repainting problem (which is adequate)
[14:44:53] <gahr> I don't think I have anything pending
[14:45:15] <gahr> except the imap crash fixup
[14:45:17] <Kinnison> Has there been any further thought on https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3165 ?
[14:45:21] <Kinnison> Or https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/2924 ?

[14:51:26] <flatcap> for the alias/query command: is that going to be useful to a lot of people?
[14:52:14] <Kinnison> I can't begin to guess, since it has been an irritation in my side since I first started using mutt, so 20 years ish? but it was only with you and your visible preparedness to entertain issue reports etc. that I reached the threshold to make the feature request.
[14:52:28] <flatcap> as for the maildir: we want to rewrite the backends *sanely*, but there are other things still getting in the way
[14:52:37] <flatcap> ok :-)
[14:52:58] * Kinnison nods.  That's fair enough.  I only get annoyed by the deleted-mails-borking-UX thing about once a week when i forget to turn my mail client off on one machine when going to use another.
[14:53:28] <Kinnison> and once a week going "ARGH" and then hitting "%" and then "alt+enter" (my binding for re-open mailbox) isn't too bad
[14:55:49] <bremner> regular ARGH is cathartic
[14:55:57] <flatcap> hehe
[14:56:29] <flatcap> gahr: ah, 8 then.  I occasionally try to pick of some small upstream commits
[15:08:32] <dcpurton> I haven't digested those issues carefully, but I find the query stuff easy and flexible. I lookup from 4 different places (abook, Gmail×2, Exchange via DavMail/LDAP) and it works pretty seemlessly
