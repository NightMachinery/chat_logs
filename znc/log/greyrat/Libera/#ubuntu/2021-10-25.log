[07:25:11] <en1gma> last night close to this time someone sent me a link to a guide on how to use a dedicated gpu with no output connected over the onboard igpu hdmi connected to tv. it used the gpu but over the igpu. i think the link was for fake/dummy gpu. i formatted my system and lost my favorites

[08:46:56] <Rick_sysop> Hello .. sorry if i disturb. i have a question regarding Android Tool -- Distro regarding Android Factory reset
[08:47:20] *** Joins: yaaii (~andirc@p1076233-ipngn5501niigatani.niigata.ocn.ne.jp)
[08:47:24] <Rick_sysop> Is there any Distro or any tool, that can be used for Android devices in order to completely Wipe.. Lock Screen,  Pin Code.  a way to factory reset Android devices.?
[08:48:03] <server> i have no idea
[08:52:08] <alkisg> Rick_sysop: there's an option for that inside android settings; unrelated to ubuntu
[08:52:35] <Rick_sysop> alkisg: are you refering to "Enable USB Debbuging from within -- Developer options)  And yes.. i know this is by default Disabled
[08:52:54] <alkisg> Rick_sysop: no, I'm referring to the "reset to factory defaults"
[08:53:12] <alkisg> Rick_sysop: example: https://www.samsung.com/za/support/mobile-devices/how-to-perform-factory-reset-on-android-smartphone/
[08:53:50] <Rick_sysop> alkisg: aah okay.. well i'm asking looking for a solution how i can achive a factory reset from outside.. meaning .. how can i build / attach a PC a machine ONLY only to wire Android devices to it.. and from that PC factory reset the portable devices. No matter Phone or Tablet.. just Android reset.
[08:53:58] <alkisg> While if you're talking about an Android phone that you don't have access to, I doubt any channel will help you as that would be the same as hacking a phone (even if it's yours)
[08:54:31] <Rick_sysop> alkisg: sometimes .. i scavenge functioning products .. only with either a Lock pattern or a Pin Code.. meaning previous owner disabandonned threw away their device without actually erase it's content ...
[08:55:14] <alkisg> Yeah, the answer to that question is the same as the answer to "how can I hack a phone?"
[08:55:37] <Rick_sysop> alkisg: yes good example.. and yes you are grasping it.
[08:55:43] <alkisg> Some phones have procedures for outside flashing, but it depends on the phone; that part isn't related to #ubuntu either; it's more on-topic for #android
[08:56:48] <Rick_sysop> alkisg: but i'm not asking HOW to do this because of ill will.. i'm asking this because sometimes sometimes .. people tend to visit me come to me with their broken Phone or broken LCD .. (And the worst thing i know is that when they do.. they don't have spare parts for explicit that) n'or they don't have the understanding of before talking asking me .. "Could you help me copy .. backup or export my
[08:56:54] <Rick_sysop> digital Data from inside) My physical device is broken and can't be manouvered..

[09:00:57] <Rick_sysop> No matter if LCD touch is broke or it could be manouver.. just want to be able to erase content.
[09:01:53] <rk4> if you're serious about erasing physical means are typical
[09:01:55] <alkisg> Rick_sysop: offtopic means two things (1) we can't discuss it here, and (2) most people here don't know about that and you're supposed to go to another channel with people that know about that, like #android

[09:09:12] <Rick_sysop> rk4: 2 scenario .. is  Someone or me myself .. scavenge or recive donated machines .. products that has been found or scavenged outside .. meaning The initial owner .. the person who disabandonend their machine didn't erase or delete all their data before throwing their physical object away .. meaning i am collecting and having in possession physcal devices which i can't manouver or make use of.

[09:19:44] <webchat54> Hey, quick question: I want to use the rofi headers in the latest release. We ship rofi-dev 1.5.4 and I need 1.7. Is there an issue with me taking the rofi files that are used as headers (https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/arm64/rofi-dev/filelist) and manually updating the files?
[09:19:52] <webchat54> Am I gonna break anything?
[09:21:52] <oerheks> webchat54, let us know when it does?
[09:22:06] <webchat54> lol
[09:22:08] <webchat54> of course
[09:22:09] <oerheks> ubuntu is still at 1.5 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rofi

[14:00:22] <cbreak> I don't think wayland has the same client server architecture as x, so you'd have to use x forwarding with x fallback, not wayland, to go that route

[14:11:31] <JanC> heller: in theory it's possible that some very old device that you can't upgrade can't connect because it only supports ancient encryption methods that are now deprecated
[14:11:58] <JanC> that's why I said checking documentation about the newer versions

[16:50:26] <JanC> you can't see from looking at a font that it is really monospace  :)
[16:50:57] <JanC> and sans-serif vs. serif vs. display can be ambiguous too
[16:53:27] <tarzeau> JanC: 90% of sans-serif and serif have a complete glyphs set unlike display which is mostly very limited
[16:53:50] <cbreak> you can do the windows thing and just parse the name. If it contains "Mono", it's a monospace font. If it contains "Sans", it's a sans-serif. This heuristic might actually work sometimes :P
[16:54:30] <JanC> but there are many fonts that are somewhere in between
[16:55:03] <tarzeau> i'm fine with a point system, like mguesser does for language guessing
[16:55:16] <lotuspsychje> stephen: just keep in mind mainline kernels are for testing purposes, not really for daily driver kernels
[16:56:06] <JanC> I mean, fonts that work if they aren't set at a too small size, but work fine for titles etc., where they might need a full glyph set

[21:41:51] <ThothCastel> this resolved a similar issue for me
[21:41:54] <en1gma> the nvidia gts 250 has nothing connected to it but i want to use it like a laptop does with hybrid graphics (switchable)
[21:41:56] <ThothCastel> by removing all nvidia drivers
[21:42:04] <ThothCastel> it then rolls back to nuveau
[21:42:08] <en1gma> yea but i wont get that good performace
[21:42:31] <en1gma> right now it does work with profile set to nvidia but it wont work on auto or power saver (intel)
[21:42:32] <ThothCastel> you might want to remove all nvidia drivers
[21:42:34] <ThothCastel> purge
[21:42:39] <ThothCastel> then reinstall it from scratch

[23:54:41] <en1gma> im having quite the problem trying to get switchable graphics to work correctly with my "Desktop Computer running ubuntu 18.04" with my i7-7700k with integrated graphics (hd 630). i added a dedicated gts 250 which can use either the nouveau driver or the nvidia 340 binary driver. i have steam installed with counter strike source to benchmark. with only the hd 630 i get 185fps. with same settings and the dedicated gpu installed with th
[23:54:41] <en1gma> e nouveau driver i get same 185fps
[23:55:24] <en1gma> how can i make sure when i run the game it is running the gts 250 with the nouveau driver instead of the hd 630 as i have no output cables connected to the gts 250. only the intel hd 630 has hdmi out to tv
[23:55:39] <en1gma> i also want to switch the nvidia 340 binary and benchmark that

[23:56:07] <pycurious> TJ-: It's bizarre. - nothing works. But scp xyz …:~ - works fine. So scp doesnt want to pull data from one machine and push to another
[23:56:09] <cbreak> en1gma: if you don't attach a screen to your GPU, then it won't do anything, graphics output wise
[23:56:17] <en1gma> so i should have a total of 3 benchmarks to compare. hd 630, gts 250 with nouveau and gts 250 with 340 binary
[23:56:36] <pycurious> This is the error i get when i try what you suggested: Host key verification failed.
[23:56:38] <en1gma> cbreak i think it can with switchable graphics like a laptop does

[23:57:05] <en1gma> im not sure if it can be switched to with the nouveau driver but nvidia has nvidia-prime to switch
[23:57:15] <sarnold> pycurious: or you could scp -3 a:foo b:foo   and bounce through the local machine
[23:57:25] <en1gma> which im going to test but i have to select the driver and reboot
[23:58:10] <en1gma> right now i just tested the nouveau driver but i dont think it actually used the gts 250 when i benchmarked but instead used the hd 630 igpu but i dont have anything i can check to see when its running
[23:58:32] <cbreak> en1gma: nvidia-smi should tell you the load of the nvidia gpu
[23:58:36] <cbreak> if you have access to that thing.
[23:58:49] <en1gma> ok will check that as soon as i select the nvidia driver and reboot.
[23:58:56] <en1gma> let me check the command right now.
