[02:57:13] <jim> I have this handy blerb about lvm... with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and
[02:57:13] <jim> these are what you would format and mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.
[02:57:59] <Chanakan5591> lvm is a pain to work with in my opinion

[03:38:42] <SuperNick> it forces me to run lightdm as the sudo user, even when I do though, it doesn't actually start lightdm

[03:48:13] <bparker> phinxy: you asked for the dvd drive PATA version. the drive may support a different version than the motherboard.
[03:48:31] <bparker> so you must refer to your drive's specs
[03:48:55] <bparker> that's not usually something you can query for from software

[03:49:00] <bparker> only what the *currently* used version is
[03:49:04] <bparker> not the max supported one
[03:49:06] <SuperNick> bparker I tried that and now I get a black screen :/
[03:49:25] <bparker> SuperNick: ctrl-alt-f1 to go back to the console, and ctrl-c it, then check for a log
[03:49:30] <SuperNick> no 'X' mouse cursor like default Xorg either
[03:49:41] <bparker> yea you wouldn't if xinit/startx didn't work
[03:49:56] <bparker> there's some fundamental video (driver/config) issue

[03:50:02] <phinxy> bparker I must have been choosing my words badly, I'd like to put a "dvd drive caddy" in the place of the dvd drive and wondered how slow it'd be.
[03:50:07] <bparker> because a default config should work 90% of the time

[04:07:26] <SuperNick> yeah I know, its weird
[04:07:33] <SuperNick> its gotta be an xinit or driver issue

[07:37:39] <Kel> some trackpads interpret a palm press as trying to reset the trackpad driver.

[08:36:45] <Dagmar> freeman_h: The sad truth of the matter is that network-enabled crime is so prevalent now that basically if you have ONE crappy password, or forget to update even ONE plugin in a mass-marketed eCommerce site, you're going to get pwned on a regular basis
[08:37:07] <Dagmar> Wordpress and anything resembling it has a "recess" time that is non-zero.
[08:37:29] <Dagmar> Meaning there WILL be some window of time each year where part of the site is vulnerable to exploitation, and you have no patch
[08:37:49] <SineDeviance> freeman_h: anyways, the point we're getting at is - if you insist on doing this yourself and hosting it yourself, you need your database server to be behind a firewall you control using nonstandard ports, prerably local. Then, you need your eshops to send transaction data to that database immediately when a customer makes a purchase. it should never be internet-facing or running on the same server the webserver is
[08:37:51] <Dagmar> Whether or not this time is a few hours or a week is up to how closely you actually try to keep everything updated.

[08:38:18] <Dagmar> It will also help somewhat if you use mod_security and SELinux
[08:38:23] <Dagmar> Actually thsoe two will help a great deal
[08:38:33] <SineDeviance> ^yep

[08:40:25] <Dagmar> SineDeviance: I pretty much won't even humor the idea anymore of not using stored procedures and very strict controls
[08:40:26] <SineDeviance> if you are unwilling to hire someone to build and maintain your webserver (because it is not a 'setup and done' job, it needs ongoing maintenance to be secure) I recommend you go with an ecom provider that offers managed services
[08:40:52] <Dagmar> Sony's massive failure is a stellar cautionary tale
[08:41:11] <SineDeviance> you talking about the psn hack?
[08:41:15] <Dagmar> Yep

[08:41:57] <freeman_h> SineDeviance, i did try move it to godaddy however the site didnt work
[08:42:00] <Dagmar> IF they had been using stored procedures instead of just allowing processes free reign of the tables, it would have at least made exfiltrating all that data tedious, not to mention lots more detectable

[08:43:42] <freeman_h> might as well go delivery pizza
[08:44:01] <Dagmar> freeman_h: Even managed hosting where the hosting provider keeps your wordpress and plugins updated for you would be a big step forward

[08:44:58] <Dagmar> Your other options are to just spend the next year to two years learning in-depth how to do it all properly, and then charge other people to do it for htem
[08:45:20] <Dagmar> That sort of presumes a large amount of free time and a high IQ tho

[08:48:39] <freeman_h> will move it to shopify defo

[12:01:08] <PaulFertser> To clarify a bit, every SD card (and USB flash storage device) has an MCU with some RAM and plenty of NAND to handle. This MCU runs proprietary firmware, and some are more buggy than the others but in any case you can hardly learn anything about what is it really doing and what are the current issues and the amount of bad blocks (NAND always has some!) and how wear-leveling algorithms perform etc.

[12:08:52] <PaulFertser> rudi_s: please clarify? I'm fairly certain when a block write of all zeroes happen all cards understand that it's essentially a "discard" and so the flash consumed is declared free and once you write to the whole card it can start behaving better. I have first-hand experience with some cards that were used in embedded and sometimes they became quite slow but writing zero blocks made them as fast

[12:10:44] <rudi_s> PaulFertser: Interesting. I haven't performed any tests but I assumed SD cards are so bad that they won't properly detect that.
[12:11:00] <godSend23> any recs on linux baremetal servers that can do windows vms?
[12:11:13] <PaulFertser> rudi_s: and on eMMC in my ac100 netbook I occassionally had a problem with certain sectors giving I/O errors on read (and it was consistent across power cycles) but every time that was "fixable" by writing bs=4096 zeros to the affected area.

[12:14:23] <PaulFertser> rudi_s: I think if proper SD/MMC cardreader is used (not the one that pretends to be USB mass storage) you can send real discard commands to the cards with "blkdiscard" utility. I've seen one crappy cards accepting it. But it completely locked after a bit more testing anyway.
[12:14:33] <PaulFertser> ThinkT510: just to test that all sectors are readable.

[12:18:44] <PaulFertser> rudi_s: I remember we had some equipment based on Analog Devices DSP processor which was saving plenty of seismic data to an SD card. And then one or two of them started to be much slower when reading back the recorded data, even when ejected from the device using a cardreader on some windows laptop. Then my dd /dev/zero treatment clearly showed an improvement (I do not remember the details but
[12:18:50] <PaulFertser> probably it was 2x or even 10x the speed) and at least for a few following tests the card was as fast as new.

[21:15:29] <nomagno[m]> more people. It might be unnecessarily alarmist but... computers don't run themselves, and I am not convinced that point is getting across well enough

There was an intellectual property issue with the most popular BSD flavour from late 80s to early 90s (386BSD) that would eventually lead to the creation of the BSD duo (now trio). Linus Torvalds made Linux because in those three or four years BSD effectively died, and there was no free Unix flavour. Had the timing been off ever so slightly, I
[23:10:38] <nomagno[m]> remember reading a quote somewhere he would have been able to obtain Unix, and would not have made Linux. Let's not get too heated alright?

[23:45:40] <nomagno[m]> fakuve: Well you can not reasonably expect a user-maintained distribution to have 100% consistency in its repositories. However it is stable and gets security and compatibility patches for... Well, as long as people are willing to make the patches, which is usually fairly long. The release cycle has been proven to work, however you also need to take into account a distribution is simply infrastructure you build your system on top of, not the
[23:45:40] <nomagno[m]> whole system. Also buster is oldstable, you can go with stable (bullseye), unstable (sid), or testing (tumbleweed) if you do not care about 100% package reliability, which most non-debian distros do not have anyways.

[23:47:24] <nomagno[m]> Also keep in mind if you find an issue with Debian, and you know how to fix it, you can contribute it! This is how they get most of their stuff done, tho of course for the end-user this means if something has low demand it will need to be manually installed, save for rare cases. I see no issue with this, most Ubuntu derivatives (the ones without telemetry) are more user friendly and that is fine.
