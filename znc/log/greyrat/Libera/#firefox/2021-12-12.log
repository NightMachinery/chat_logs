[11:41:02] <Togra> if you have a libva-utils package or something similar, you might be able to install that and find a utility that'll tell you if it's finding your GPU correctly
[11:41:11] <Togra> I recall doing that a while back but haven't used VAAPI recently
[11:41:29] <Togra> easiest test but maybe not the best, play a video that's really high resolution, and see if your system is fine with it, or if it gets sad

[19:01:29] <xx> can I directly upgrade firefox from firefox 4? Without losing cookies/history/passwords/...
[19:01:34] <xx> or do I need to do it in some steps

[19:03:05] <Timvde> Definitely not in one go
[19:03:24] <Timvde> If you use the built-in update mechanism, I think that Firefox will automatically pick the necessary steps
[19:04:41] <acidsys> can't hurt to take a backup of the firefox profile beforehand. :)
[19:06:29] <ede> should be the first step in every upgrade/migration process anyway
[19:06:44] <ede> no 2nd step. 1st should be proper planning.

[20:55:02] <Timvde> methuzla: then Firefox can't help it that the package manager is updating its files on disk while it's running
[20:55:50] <Timvde> Firefox's own updater should handle that (although there are some edge cases, in particular when running multiple profiles in parallel)
[20:57:05] *** Joins: voltron (~voltrin_@ip4d16bdc6.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[20:57:16] <methuzla> afaik package manager isn't doing things behind scenes. for everything else, manual updates are required.
[21:00:45] <methuzla> app.update.auto is set false in about:config (but it still updates)
[21:01:25] <Timvde> methuzla: but you are updating while Firefox is running
[21:01:31] <methuzla> how?
[21:01:56] <Timvde> sudo apt-get upgrade, if you are using a debian-like distro
[21:02:12] <methuzla> i am not doing that while firefox is running
[21:02:54] <Timvde> Then you shouldn't be getting that error :/
[21:03:09] <methuzla> yet i am
[21:03:22] <Timvde> Do you have unattended-upgrades (or whatever it's called) enabled?
[21:03:48] <methuzla> in firefox? or something in apt?
[21:03:54] <Timvde> In apt
[21:04:04] <methuzla> not that i know
[21:04:11] <Timvde> Do you see nothing happening in /var/log/apt/history.log?
[21:04:25] <methuzla> i get a "updates available" message, and then must manually initiate the updates, for all other packages

[21:05:12] <Timvde> I mean, if you installed Firefox using your package manager, it doesn't even have permission to update itself, it literally can't
[21:05:12] <methuzla> no, nothing useful in log files
[21:06:36] <methuzla> i found info yesterday about creating a json file in /etc/firefox/policies
[21:07:09] <methuzla> simple json file that sets BackgroundAppUpdate to false

[23:55:05] <methuzla> no special reason why i was using package install. so maybe this will end up working.
[23:55:34] <ede> and i'd really like to know what gtk is doing, i also have an instance of weechat running, can't switch to it in such situations, but it keeps the connection.
