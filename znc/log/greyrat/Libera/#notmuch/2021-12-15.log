[00:51:01] <Ebrahim[m]> Is there anyway to change the default "unread" tag in Emacs to something like "new"?
[00:54:00] <bremner> the tag unread is special, at least if you use Maildir flags.
[00:55:50] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: maybe you could give a bit more detail of what you want to do?
[01:48:35] <Ebrahim[m]> Since `afew` uses `new` tags in order to not process the received emails, I'm trying to configure that with notmuch emacs.

[12:51:52] <Alzaii> Hi I've got a series of emails with superfluous tags (put thare by the default afew config) and I can't seem to figure the syntax to --remove-all
[12:51:52] <Alzaii> I was going "notmuch tag +inbox --remove-all tag:lists" which doesn't seem to do anything
[12:53:07] <Alzaii> Nevermind, just reading it made me realise it should go before the +inbox

[18:16:09] <anarchat> i think afew maps "new" to the "inbox" tag, not "unread"
[18:16:18] <anarchat> so you need to get familiar with the "archive" workflow
[18:16:26] <anarchat> basically what bremner said

[21:05:13] <Ebrahim[m]> <anarchat> "i think afew maps "new" to the..." <- No it maps `new` to `new` tags :(
[21:05:13] <Ebrahim[m]> I've also requested to `afew` maintainer if we can add the ability to change it to something like `unread`
[21:11:38] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: fwiw, I still don't understand precisely what you want.
[21:21:16] <Ebrahim[m]> Sorry for that. It's about finding a way for `afew` in order to only process new tags.
[21:21:16] <Ebrahim[m]> https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#notmuch-config
[21:24:17] <Ebrahim[m]> If I add `[new] tags=new` to `.notmuch-config`, I can't remove the `new` tag when I open emails like `unread`.
[21:24:59] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: the idea is that afew (or whatever postprocessor you use) should normally remove new, and add e.g. inbox, unread
[21:25:44] <Ebrahim[m]> It can be solved if notmuch-emacs remove new tag when I open emails or, afew uses something like `unread` instead of `new`
[21:26:51] <bremner> Ebrahim[m]: I think you will have an easier time if you do things the way I just described.
[21:28:07] <bremner> I don't use afew, but at least for manual tagging approaches, new is just an optimization to prevent scanning old messages to retag them
[21:28:31] <bremner> anyway, maybe some discussion with afew users will help
[21:45:39] <Ebrahim[m]> Yes. Thanks breamner :)

[22:48:40] <anarchat> Ebrahim[m]: the point is that you make notmuch add a "new" tag, then afew processes emails only matching that "new" tag
[22:48:53] <anarchat> it will typically remove the "new" tag and add "inbox", but you can customize that
[22:49:33] <anarchat> you can either make notmuch add "new,unread" and then treat both separately, or have notmuch add "new", then afew add "unread" and remove "new"
