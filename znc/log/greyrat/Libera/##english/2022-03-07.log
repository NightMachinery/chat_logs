[04:11:29] <kurahaupo> b1ack0p: the +er suffix can be used to denote many things including a maker, but it could also mean a seller, or a user/consumer, or a proponent/supporter, or many other things. And "maker" can refer to a person or a device.

[04:38:39] <Maxdamantus> It's normally used as an agentive suffix to turn a verb into a noun.
[04:38:53] <Maxdamantus> so a "creamer" is someone/something that "creams".
[04:40:34] <twb> kurahaupo: the usual term is "agentive"
[04:40:57] <Maxdamantus> Indeed, and it's quite regular in English.
[04:41:09] <twb> cf. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE#Hindi
[04:41:20] <Maxdamantus> You can apply it to any verb. If it looks like it's been applied to a noun, that noun is probably being used as a verb.
[04:41:51] <twb> "dabbawallah" literally means "box + -er"
[04:42:07] <twb> But it's in the sense of "someone who moves a box from one place to another"
[04:42:34] <twb> (not "one who hits people for money")
[04:44:49] <Maxdamantus> Actually, there might be some verbs that don't have a corresponding agentive noun, but they're special cases, and they probably only don't exist because they are such common words but are not commonly used to construct agent nouns.
[04:45:13] <twb> An easy way to find one is to look for a noun that already ends in -er
[04:45:23] <Maxdamantus> eg, "beer" is strange (someone who is/bes), though "doer" is less strange.
[04:45:26] <twb> "beerer" sound quite odd
[04:45:42] <twb> Maxdamantus: haha I was close!
[04:45:56] <twb> "torer" is usually written "torifier" or so
[04:47:12] <twb> b1ack0p: anyway.  In your original question, I would use "ice cream maker" because "ice creamer" is confusing due to the compound noun
[04:47:32] <twb> "ice creamer" sounds like "a thing that creams ice"
[04:47:49] <twb> You could also probably say something like "ice cream churn"
[04:48:26] <twb> Personally I just use a blender

[04:49:49] <maxtim> twb, Heresy!
[04:49:55] <Maxdamantus> Indeed, I think "ice cream" as a verb is weird. You would normally say "I am making ice cream", not "I am ice creaming".
[04:50:21] <twb> Or indeed "cheesing"
[04:50:36] <twb> "to cheese it" means to flee from police
[04:51:06] *** feainnewedd is now known as solveig
[04:51:35] <maxtim> I've never heard that colloquialism "to cheese it" before...
[04:51:55] <maxtim> Where does that come from?
