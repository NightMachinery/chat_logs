[00:43:57] <rdrg109> konubinix: That's great. Thanks for sharing!
[00:47:15] <rdrg109> konubinix: tbh, I didn't know using :around would be useful in caching the completiong list. I need to get more familiar with advice-add
[00:49:24] <rdrg109> Wow, it makes experience way more fast

[01:23:40] <rdrg109> konubinix: In regards, to storing NUMBER_OF_VISITS. I just stopped doing it because that involved saving the current buffer and that's not something that I want to do whenever I execute org-roam-node-find.
[01:24:36] <rdrg109> I determined that a more appropiate way to handle metadata of ndoes (number of visists, date of creation, last modification date) was to store it in an external database which would live in the same directory where my nodes live.

[12:10:29] <osan[m]> okay, I solved it woth `org-element-cache-reset`. It might be a problem with my greater configuration, so it's not something to report
