[03:25:52] <systemfault> lol

[03:27:51] <systemfault> JUST GIT GOOD
[03:28:36] <systemfault> I'm pretty use you need to know as much Dart to use SASS than you need to know C++ to use NodeJS.
[03:28:51] <chazy> omg, who thought of starting the months with 0 instead of 1 for Date.UTC()? endUTC = Date.UTC(date[0], date[1]-1, date[2], time[0], time[1], time[2]), <-- i've been pulling my hair for the last hour
[03:29:20] <chazy> (not that i have any left, but still)
[03:30:38] <systemfault> *pretty sure
[03:31:22] <PenguinMan98> Maybe I'm a special case, but I've never needed to dabble in C++ while using node.js
[03:31:40] <systemfault> And you don't need to dabble with Dart to use SASS
[03:32:57] <PenguinMan98> It seems like I do. The sass compiler can only do one file at a time so I'd have to write a dart program to feed it files
[03:33:06] <systemfault> It's been years since I've used SASS.. but IIRC, you only need to specify the sheets you want to compile.. So... like main.scss, some-page.scss... etc

[03:41:14] <PenguinMan98> Also, the first page tutorial of how to use dart-sass gives you a dart program to put in a compile-sass.dart file
[03:41:41] <PenguinMan98> So yes, they do expect you to write your compiler yourself in Dart.
[03:42:35] <PenguinMan98> And for bonus points, that program doesn't use 'compileToResult' which is what they recommend for compiling sass!
[03:43:06] <PenguinMan98> Weee! We good code. You use package. enjoy happy do it yourself.
[03:43:30] <systemfault> You're probably the only guy complaining about SASS on the planet...
[03:43:50] <systemfault> Maybe... just maybe, you're doing something wrong... or there's something fundamental that you don't understand.
[03:45:01] <PenguinMan98> Well, does everybody else just suck it up and learn dart and write their own compiler?
[03:45:21] <systemfault> Nobody learns Dart, it's fucking garbage.
[03:45:26] <theskillwithin> no, you should not have to learn dart
[03:45:43] <PenguinMan98> Then why does sass out of the box not support compiling more than one file at a time
[03:46:17] <theskillwithin> for some reason node sass is depricated, so now its dart sass.  and I have found dart sass annoying at times with its warnings
[03:46:32] <PenguinMan98> Is it too much to ask to let me specify a directory?
[03:47:07] <systemfault> node-sass was a stupid idea...

[03:52:24] <systemfault> Then keep gulp for now

[03:52:56] <PenguinMan98> So you'd think that there would be one simple tutorial for how to do sass compilation with modern tools
[03:53:05] <PenguinMan98> Or even 2-3 competing ones
[03:54:20] <PenguinMan98> Instead, all I find is a scattering of packages without anything tying them together with incomplete or missing documentation for how to add it to npm. Npm only supports single commands so you have to do it all in one call making the commands super long and impossible to read this way.

[10:59:57] <no_gravity> Hello! When x turned into y in z years, what is the formula to calculate the annualized roi?
[11:00:46] <no_gravity> I can think of the opposite. end_value = start_value * roi^years
[11:01:39] <no_gravity> n> start=10; roi=1.1; years=5; start*Math.pow(roi,years)
[11:01:41] <jellobot> (okay) 16.105100000000007
[11:02:10] <no_gravity> So $10 will turn into $16 when an interest rate of 10% is applied for 5 years.
[11:02:38] <no_gravity> But how to convert that so the roi can be calculated from start/end/years?
[11:06:04] <d3x0r> log(start)+roi*years =    .. roi = -log(start)/years
[11:06:06] <d3x0r> ?

[11:08:42] <ljharb> it's literally just working backwards one step at a time. but the inverse of `x ** y = z` is `z ** 1/y = x`
[11:08:52] <no_gravity> ljharb: Let's see ...
[11:08:53] <ljharb> you can probably do it with log too but i can never remember that one
[11:09:05] <d3x0r> well eas getting rid of the xp
[11:09:07] <ljharb> something like `Math.log(z) / Math.log(y)`

[11:28:12] <no_gravity> theskillwithin: I am calculating what growth expectation the market has into growth stocks.
[11:29:42] <theskillwithin> no_gravity like someone hired you to do this, or for your own site?
[11:29:54] <no_gravity> theskillwithin: Neither. I just like to think about the world.
[11:31:19] <no_gravity> It is interesting to look at young companies, the valuation of the market and think about what future story this valuation implies.

[11:32:25] <no_gravity> ashnur: If that was the case, all young public companies would be traded at 0. As they all spend more money than they make.

[14:50:53] <powftw> Hey anyone..
[14:51:10] <powftw> https://bpa.st/WI7Q
[14:51:49] <powftw> I'm using fetch function in front. So, is there some way that I can show "\David" in frontend?
[14:52:45] <Maxdamantus> powftw: with the quotes?
[14:52:58] <powftw> No
[14:53:05] <powftw> Without it
[14:53:10] <Maxdamantus> powftw: do you see quotes currently?
[14:53:36] <powftw> There's a funny thing going on..
[14:54:27] <powftw> If I only return a single string, I get "\David" in console. But when I send a dictionary to frontend using fetch, I get "\\David"
[14:54:52] <powftw> So, wherever I use a dictionary, the double slash seems not going.
[14:55:49] <powftw> But, how else do I pass the the json data from back to front, I need that David to be shown as \David and not \\David
[14:55:54] <Maxdamantus> Browser consoles are pretty bad for figuring out what the actual string is. The main thing should be what you're seeing on the page.

[14:56:54] <Maxdamantus> If you're seeing two slashes but no quotes, something weird has happened (I wouldn't be surprised if you're seeing that in a browser console, because again, browser consoles are crap at showing strings).
[14:57:47] <Maxdamantus> but since you seem to be emitting JSON, your frontend code should be interpreting that content as JSON (eg, using `JSON.parse`), and the output of that interpretation will be a string starting with a single backslash.

[15:01:05] <Maxdamantus> As long as you don't do something silly like slice the string yourself or trim quotes, you should be seeing either the actual string (which has a single backslash and no quotes), or you should be seeing the JSON representation of the string (which has quotes and two backslashes).

[15:21:10] <powftw> Maxdamantus:
[15:21:46] <powftw> i have just added JSON.parse() and then console says "Fetch error: TypeError: response.JSON is undefined"
[15:22:05] <d3x0r> ya JSON returns the JSON you has to pass that to JSON.parse( JSON )
[15:22:44] <d3x0r>  response.JSON.then(function (data) {             console.log(JSON.parse(data ));        });   maybe
[15:23:31] <d3x0r> no wait JSON should parse the result too right? so data is just the object?
[15:23:38] <Maxdamantus> You want to use `response.json()`, which essentially does the `JSON.parse` bit for you.
[15:23:50] <Maxdamantus> response.json().then(function(data){ .. })
[15:24:33] <Maxdamantus> but all you're doing is logging it to the console, where you're presumably looking at it through the browser dev tools, which as I said above, is bad at looking at strings.
[15:24:46] <Maxdamantus> at least Chrome's dev tools have really horrible behaviour for showing strings.
[15:25:00] <powftw> what about FF?
[15:25:34] <Maxdamantus> If you do something like `document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.name));`, you'll probably see the proper string.
[15:26:21] <Maxdamantus> Looking at it now, Firefox seems to be better, but I'm sure I remember Firefox also doing some stupid things with strings in the console.
[15:27:16] <powftw> ```.then(function (response.json()) {```
[15:27:23] <Maxdamantus> No.
[15:27:40] <Maxdamantus> 00:53:49 < Maxdamantus> response.json().then(function(data){ .. })
[15:29:57] <powftw> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/hkHFZ6I7/
[15:30:18] <powftw> looks okay? i have ```Uncaught ReferenceError: response is not defined```

[16:05:02] <d3x0r> void (expression) returns nothing
[16:05:33] <Maxdamantus> console.log({ foo: "\"" });

[16:05:51] <Maxdamantus> Not sure what you're referring to in Node, but that's what I see in the Chromium console.
[16:06:02] <powftw> can i access the values inside the function? ```{{ ata.strict_extrct }} ```
[16:06:07] <powftw> can i access the values inside the function? ```{{ data.strict_extrct }} ```
[16:06:28] <stenno> Maxdamantus: i am referring to a file with that content which is then read by fs.readFile and parsed with JSON.parse
[16:07:01] <Maxdamantus> stenno: the issue isn't parsing JSON. The issue is representing strings unambiguously.
[16:07:17] <stenno> indeed
[16:07:28] <Maxdamantus> stenno: it could represent them unambiguously by encoding them as JSON, but it doesn't encode them as JSON. It just sticks quotes around the string content.
[16:07:59] <stenno> but {"foo": "\""} is valid json

[16:08:33] <Maxdamantus> Right, but the result of logging that object in Chromium is not valid anything.
[16:08:41] <Maxdamantus> {foo: """}
[16:08:46] <Maxdamantus> That output is complete nonsense.
[16:09:49] <stenno> true
[16:09:53] <Maxdamantus> console.log({ foo: "\"", bar: "\"" }); console.log({ foo: "\"\", bar: \"\"" });
[16:09:53] <stenno> ok i gotcha
[16:09:56] <Maxdamantus> VM266:1
[16:09:58] <Maxdamantus> {foo: """, bar: """}
[16:10:01] <Maxdamantus> VM266:1
[16:10:03] <Maxdamantus> {foo: """, bar: """}
[16:10:12] <Maxdamantus> It just logs apparently the same thing twice, just with different colourings.
[16:10:34] <Maxdamantus> even though those are quite different objects with quite different strings.
[16:11:22] <Alexendoo> seems to have changed at some point
[16:11:55] <Alexendoo> since mine doesn't show it ambiguously, it switches to single quotes for the outer ones
[16:12:33] <Maxdamantus> It's possible that my Chromium is a few versions out of date. I don't use it primarily.

[16:16:58] <powftw> {{ data.MYNAME }} actually
[16:18:09] <powftw> just this, display the result of data.MYNAME inside <h1>
[16:18:41] <Maxdamantus> Yes. You've always been allowed to compile Chromium source code and redistribute your own binaries as "Chromium".
[16:19:08] <powftw> we've bromite!
[16:19:10] <Maxdamantus> The issue is that you weren't allowed to do that with Firefox. If you compiled Firefox, you couldn't distribute the binaries as "Firefox", unless you got permission to do so from Mozilla.
[16:19:21] <powftw> 😘
[16:19:59] <powftw> FF sucks with PWA?
[16:20:30] <Maxdamantus> Debian could have got permission, but arguably that wouldn't follow the principle of copyleft, since someone wanting to fork Debian would also have to ask Mozilla if they could distribute their own "Firefox" binaries.

[18:20:49] <davidv7> if not i'll just suffer

[18:32:19] <Cork> you can set max for progress so you could add extra markings at say 50% and do it that way

[20:17:55] <PenguinMan98> I'm still trying to figure out what kind of bundler/task runner I should be recommending for this project I'm working on. It's an extremely basic custom php/html/css/js app. No fancy frameworks at ALL.  Looking at webpack, it seems like the idea is you have a client-side javascript app that you want to bundle up and serve. npm/yarn can do some
[20:17:55] <PenguinMan98> simple task running by themselves but they are limited to single-line commands. Gulp so far seems the best solution for more complex task running.
[20:18:37] <PenguinMan98> However the brain trust here says gulp is old and shouldn't be used.

[21:16:01] <PenguinMan98> The funny thing is, the more active a project is, the less useful it is in a startup because it changes too often and requires too much adaptation.
[21:16:47] <PenguinMan98> You end up spending way too much of your development hours just maintaining what you have instead of adding features.
[21:17:07] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: anything called a "monolith" is not a basic app
[21:17:55] <PenguinMan98> I call it basic because it's the php app pattern I built my first web app with back in college.
[21:18:00] <austincheney> no, the standard web technologies appear to be backwards compatible (as in everything including visual rendering) back about 15 years and things more stable now than they used to be
[21:18:15] <austincheney> so don't have to be on a sinking ship

[21:32:55] <The_Blode> Good evening guys. Can anybody help me out. I'm browsing a website which is using pagination (and possibly Vue.JS) and it's eating my system's RAM causing the browser to lock up. Anything I can do client side to prevent this RAM usage?
[21:33:00] <PenguinMan98> It's like taking away an artists brush and giving them rubber stamps instead.
[21:33:56] <PenguinMan98> You could try turning off javascript, but that may make it completely unuseable.
[21:34:27] <ljharb> The_Blode: you can install more ram or upgrade your cpu
[21:34:33] <ljharb> The_Blode: what browser?
[21:34:38] <The_Blode> Is this the site's fault or my fault?
[21:34:44] <The_Blode> Google Chrome.
[21:34:49] <ljharb> The_Blode: how old is your computer?
[21:34:49] <PenguinMan98> I'd look at the network tab to see if it's making a ridiculous amount of calls to the server
[21:34:57] <The_Blode> The site is displaying 2500 products and using pagination.
[21:35:06] <The_Blode> I can link the site so you can see how they're doing it.
[21:35:11] <PenguinMan98> Heh, pray it isn't using angular
[21:35:31] <PenguinMan98> Angular slows down fast the more items you have on the page

[21:35:44] <ljharb> The_Blode: how old is your computer?
[21:36:15] <The_Blode> I have an Intel NUC built around 2018 with 8GB of RAM
[21:36:23] <The_Blode> Somewhat old and somewhat underpower.
[21:36:34] <PenguinMan98> Heh, I guess too many people hit that site from too many directions at once

[21:37:26] <The_Blode> Oh wait...R.I.P
[21:37:40] <ljharb> The_Blode: so it's kind of the site's fault and also kind of the browser's fault, but since everyone does that (ships too much JS), it's not really your fault because 3-4 years is generally when a computer should be replaced.
[21:38:03] <The_Blode> Thank you.
[21:38:07] <ljharb> The_Blode: so you certainly can get an updated computer - 8 gigs is a very small number for 2018, let alone for 2021
[21:38:11] <PenguinMan98> I ship it

[21:43:55] <PenguinMan98> I knew a guy who built a website for an author, but the author didn't want to pay him for it so he scraped the site, bought a different domain, and put the site up there instead and left the developer with the bills.

[21:49:56] <paulcarroty> @ljharb bullshit, no permission is needed
[21:50:01] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: in the public data case, you already have permission, because it's public data and you're in the public. but that still doesn't mean it's ethical because the taxpayers have to pay for the bandwith.
[21:50:06] <PenguinMan98> No, it went the other way. the author paid for the development, then stole the code and put it up on another domain and screwed the developer.
[21:50:09] <ljharb> paulcarroty: for ethical reasons? absolutely it's needed
[21:50:24] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: right. and it's not ethical to steal it back. the developer needs to have sued the author.
[21:50:32] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: two wrongs don't make a right, and all that
[21:50:35] <PenguinMan98> The developer did sue. And lost.
[21:50:44] <ljharb> then while that sucks, them's the breaks
[21:50:53] <paulcarroty> if you put some info on website - it's public info. I don't need your permission to scarape the data.
[21:51:05] <ljharb> that means the author can sue the developer, and win. so it's REALLY stupid for the dev to have scraped that stuff.
[21:51:06] <PenguinMan98> The author had more money and drug out the case until the developer went broke.
[21:51:09] <ljharb> paulcarroty: that's false.
[21:51:21] <PenguinMan98> The dev didn't do the scraping, the author did

[23:28:39] <leptone> is there a way to find out all the sub routes that where set up by a website API? Exp. I know there is site.com/tree/ but thats it. GET request handlers are define on the server for site.com/tree/brancehs/ and site.com/tree/leaves. But I don't know that. Is there a way for me to figure out all the route that I can make a GET request to?

[23:46:56] <trafficjam> do you mean like sending the data instead of using an iframe?
[23:48:13] <qswz> from the api, you can send html or json containing html, as youlike, and add cors
