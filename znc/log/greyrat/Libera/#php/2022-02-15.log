[03:26:38] <Dr-007> i got a question about composer / laravel, can i just shoot away? #composer and #laravel channels are a little bit empty and unresponsive
[03:27:17] <lembron> dont ask to ask *nods*
[03:27:54] <Dr-007> sorry, ok here it is. im having this composer error: orchid/platform 12.1.0 requires laravel/framework ^9.0 -> found laravel/framework[v9.0.0-beta.1, ..., 9.x-dev] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (^8.75).
[03:28:09] <Dr-007> it looks like composer complains about my laravel not being version 9
[03:28:24] <Dr-007> but the found part tells me it is version 9-beta
[03:28:41] <Dr-007> so perhabs thats why they mitchmatch, but how would i fix this?
[03:29:01] *** Joins: nolan_ (~nolan_@user/nolan/x-2434303)
[03:29:23] <Dr-007> (via the composer.json file)
[03:30:55] <judah> What version is described in your composer.json file?
[03:31:28] <lembron> no actual laravel clue - but "found v9.0.0-beta.1" - tried going to v9.0.2 or there like there? could see it getting stuck up on the "-beta" - and what does your composer.json request? "(^8.75)" as printed there or actually smth else?
[03:31:57] <Dr-007> judah, "laravel/framework": "^8.75",
[03:32:31] <judah> Are you trying to install orchid/platform?
[03:32:37] <Dr-007> yes
[03:32:56] <judah> Try 'composer require orchid/platform:*' to see if it picks up an older version that will work with your laravel version
[03:33:15] <judah> Sometimes composer is a bit lazy and says it cant work with the latest version, when the previous version would work fine
[03:33:40] <Dr-007> ok, im waiting for composer to complete something else i tried
[03:33:41] <lembron> then "^8.75" smells about right to not get solved - guess the bigger Q then is how you got 9-beta on your disk, and revert that?
[03:33:44] <judah> THEN, once you did that, note down what version it actually installed then re-run the composer command but with that version constraint. You dont want a * in your .json
[03:34:11] <Dr-007> i modified the ^8.75 to ^9 and ran composer update, for i think that would the install / update the stuff

[03:35:37] <judah> fix your install first though, maybe roll back to a recent commit
[03:35:54] <judah> you wont know if the upgrade broke your app if you dont know if your app worked right in the first place
[03:36:00] <judah> :thumbsup:
[03:36:34] <Dr-007> lembron, i dont know how i ended up with that version i am following a few guides which got me going with a laravel api, now i wanto add the admin pages. first guide: https://www.toptal.com/laravel/restful-laravel-api-tutorial and now im stuck on the composer error via this guide https://orchid.software/en/docs/installation/
[03:37:28] <Dr-007> judah, i think thats what i should do then. since im still in the begin process
[03:38:20] <Dr-007> lembron, i install laravel via `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myapp`
[03:39:11] <lembron> guess just the general note then - make sure to not get tangled up manually editing that composer.json, this leads to all sorta spookyness ;-)

[04:41:39] <Dr-007> ok, im stuck. i figured i update php, then my laravel version and then it would be all ok. the last laravel needs php 8. ive got php 7.3
[04:41:48] <Dr-007> so i tried updating it to php 8
[04:42:05] <Dr-007> but now im getting 'illegal instruction' errors when i run php.
[04:42:34] <Dr-007> this is what i found about that 'Raspberry Pi 1 Model B has an ARMv6 compatible CPU. The deb.sury.org repository is not supporting ARMv6. So you’ll need at least ARMv7-A compatible CPU.'
[04:43:04] <Dr-007> is it at all possible to get a php 8 version to run on the pi with the ARMv6 cpu?
[04:44:02] <Dr-007> and if it is, can i make `make` the php code on another machine, then tarball it and put it on the pi?

[04:49:25] <TinoDidriksen> Can even use debuild and qemu-static to cross-build the official package for ARMv6.
[04:49:55] <Dr-007> that sounds like acracadabra to me
[04:50:39] <TinoDidriksen> It's advanced stuff, but yes it is both possible to cross-build using native tools but target ARMv6, and it's possible to emulate a whole ARMv6 computer and build on that.

[16:45:00] <bizolos> Hi there. I was looking for the official way of using arrays in PHP attributes but can't find this information. Seems like the way to go is to just use the regular array syntax `['a' => 'foo']` right?
[16:45:23] <bizolos> But in the doctrine documentation, they use the standard array syntax, but also a `{'foo'}` syntax: https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.10/reference/attributes-reference.html#attrref_index
[16:45:34] <bizolos> Are both valid? Do they mean something different?

[16:56:22] <TinoDidriksen> That looks like Doctrine-specific syntax, so ask their channel.
[16:59:44] <silly> what could go wrong if i did `$_POST = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);`?
[17:01:05] <__adrian> you could overwrite anything that's actually in $_POST, for starters
[17:01:21] <silly> i'd check if it's an empty array first
[17:01:30] <__adrian> recommend  $input = ...  anyway. avoid superglobals.
[17:01:51] <silly> i'd like to do this in index.php with flightphp
[17:01:57] <__adrian> no - the thing to check is whether the request Content-type was "application/json".
[17:02:09] <silly> and use $_POST later in routes
[17:02:16] <__adrian> "i want json" doesn't mean anybody is actually giving you json.
[17:02:32] <silly> well, i can check for that too
[17:02:43] <__adrian> use $input in routes  ;)
[17:03:44] <silly> i feel like it's easier to be consistent with $_POST
[17:04:05] <silly> i might switch to formencoded one day
[17:04:38] <__adrian> what i'm talking about is not this use case specifically. i'm talking about avoiding globals and using dependency injection. nothing to do with the content-type.
[17:04:40] <silly> x-www-form-urlencoded, with real forms
[17:05:42] <silly> you mean avoiding built in globals? $input would be a global too innit? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:05:48] <__adrian> $_POST is well-understood and many people don't even realize you can alter it, but it's still a global and has all the same problems. if you wanted to $input = $_POST and pass that to your application, that would make sense. but _making_ more globals does not.
[17:06:06] <silly> oic
[17:06:15] <__adrian> no, it would not be global. you'd pass it to the objects/functions that need it.
[17:06:52] <__adrian> (i mean, depending on what scope you were in when you create it, it might be in the global scope. but i'm not talking about using it that way.)
[17:08:50] <silly> well, doin this in index.php makes it practically a global
[17:09:39] <silly> and passing it to POST routes only feels silly and hacky too
[17:09:55] <silly> i think i'd rather assign to $_POST :(
[17:10:30] <__adrian> you can choose what you want to do, just givinng advice

[19:55:06] <Alex8532> TML: Thanks
[19:55:15] <Alex8532> My team lead and I are having a debate about unique database constraints in our app, whether to rely directly on it by handling the exception.  I want to do a SELECT query to avoid the constraint during INSERTs/UPDATEs.  It is efficent, especially when using an ORM which usually have quirks or bulk operations.  On the other hand, he wants to directly rely on the unique constraint by handling the exception.  It has caused us to use a funky design pattern
[19:55:15] <Alex8532> in some cases and could cause performance issues when doing bulk.  Tell me which approach is right?
[19:55:50] <__adrian> hint: you need to handle the violated constraint in either case

[21:56:34] <__adrian> spinningcat: read the error message. do you understand the problem it's telling you about?
[21:56:51] <AllenJB> Why do you have a < in front of the IP in the host config?
[21:56:55] <spinningcat> well yeah
[21:57:05] <__adrian> >  host name "<127.0.0.1"
[21:57:16] <__adrian> is that the correct hostname/ip  that you intended to use?
[21:57:18] <spinningcat> damn
[21:57:29] <__adrian> :)

[22:02:09] <__adrian> no, you should definitely not have a password-less user.

[22:20:15] <ash_worksi> what's the easiest way to turn ['a', 'b', 'c', ...] into ['a' => ['b' => ['c' => ...]]] ?
[22:20:39] <ash_worksi> using 2 hopscotching references?
[22:27:08] <__adrian> > 2 hopscotching references   // way
[22:27:11] <__adrian> *wat
[22:29:05] <__adrian> but, use a recursive function. (don't use references, no matter what games they play.)

[22:33:09] <ash_worksi> __adrian: 2 hopscotching references would be like, $foo = &$bar[$value1]; $foo[$value2] = [];     $bar = &$foo[$value2]; $bar[$value3] = [];  ....
[22:33:14] <ash_worksi> (was the thought)
