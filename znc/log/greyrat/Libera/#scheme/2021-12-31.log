[02:57:33] <amazigh> -1 is before 0
[02:57:44] <Spawns_Carpeting> did you use HashMap env type thing
[02:57:44] <wasamasa> I remember seeing some bytecode interpreters using the printable range

[03:46:30] <Zipheir> amazigh: Kernel is impressive.
[03:58:15] <Spawns_Carpeting> is it normal to get so mixed up trying to write a scheme interpreter? I've had a heck of a time wrapping my head around all of the concepts
[03:58:36] <Spawns_Carpeting> seems like some people catch on really fast and then some people just don't
[03:59:34] <Zipheir> There is definitely a lot to learn.
[04:00:02] <Spawns_Carpeting> those darn lambdas!
[04:01:09] <Spawns_Carpeting> combining the ideas with a stack machine gets extra confusing. some of the ideas, like captured variables goes against the way a pure stack machine would work
[04:01:44] <Spawns_Carpeting> i guess you have to analyze captures and move them off the stack if your closure outlives the current stack frame
[04:01:56] <Spawns_Carpeting> easier said than done

[05:16:35] <jrincayc> If any one is interested, started writing a tiny subset of scheme.  The draft can be gotten from https://github.com/jrincayc/r7rs-tiny-spec
[05:16:35] <jrincayc> (it eliminates continuations, side effects, and other complications.)
[05:20:08] <jrincayc> This greatly simplifies the denotational semantics.
[05:23:50] <Zipheir> Cool.  Thanks for sharing this.

[05:46:10] <jrincayc> As https://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/against-callcc.html mentions, only rarely is the whole continuation needed, usually we only need a prefix.
