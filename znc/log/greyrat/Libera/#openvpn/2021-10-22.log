[02:09:14] <badmap> Hi folks - how do VPNs such as Mullvad intercept DNS requests, when I don't see their DNS servers in my Mac's system preferences?
[02:14:15] <BtbN> They probably don't.

[02:16:33] <badmap> BtbN: dig demonstrates that it does - rather than 8.8.8.8 (when Mullvad is not running), it shows the server IP address to be 10.x.x.x (when it is running)
[02:16:58] <BtbN> I guess the OSX ui just does not reflect those DNS servers.
[02:18:03] <badmap> Any ideas how I might expose that via CLI?
[02:19:10] <xx> doesn't mullvad have its own app for this?

[02:21:00] <badmap> scutil --dns did the trick # thanks :)  Bad MacOS UI indeed.
[02:21:52] <rob0> OpenVPN Access Server can be configured to intercept and redirect DNS queries.
[02:22:24] <rob0> "how" is very simple, DNAT
[02:22:55] <badmap> Yes, I was more curious on the OS level, as the OS seemed to disagree.  Just turns out it was the UI being rubbish as BtbN inferred :)
[02:23:14] <rob0> (same thing can be done in regular open source openvpn too)
[02:23:40] <badmap> rob0: presumably that just means "create a private IP address, set DNS settings to point to that, and that private IP address routes through the VPN" ?
[02:24:12] <badmap> (the latter segment of that being the actual DNATing)
[02:24:37] <rob0> no, simply redirect the packets in the VPN to the host[s] in resolv.conf
[02:25:01] <rob0> queries from clients appear to be coming from the server
[02:25:53] <badmap> Mac apparently doesn't even use resolv.conf.. but that's another story altogether
[02:26:24] <badmap> TBH I'm not quite clear how that would work, if not for the assumed explanation I just gave
[02:26:59] <rob0> oh, your server is a Mac?
[02:27:03] <badmap> The DNS server _is_ set to a private IP, which openvpn must have created - and therefore that IP address must be getting DNAT'd to the VPN server
[02:27:11] <badmap> No, just the client
[02:27:27] <rob0> I was talking about resolv.conf on the server
[02:27:30] <badmap> I have no control/visibility of the server, as it's a 3rd party
[02:28:07] <rob0> and no, openvpn might not be creating the address, just providing connectivity to it
[02:28:37] <badmap> The 10.x.x.x DNS server must have come from somewhere
[02:29:57] <badmap> Anywho - thanks for the support all! :)
