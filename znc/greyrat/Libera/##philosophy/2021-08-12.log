[01:53:44] <Parf> nope!
[01:54:10] <Parf> god's real, love is extant, and nihilists will forever eat dicks!

[01:56:53] <Parf> you think chaos exists?
[01:57:53] <krb> might sound like a 3 variable problem thing
[01:58:29] <hovercat_> before what we perceive as the big bang, was order, compared to what we have now. Swirling nebulas of gas, stars forming and colliding into each other. Humans in slavery of other humans. It is rather chaotic imho.
[01:59:17] <hovercat_> that chaos although, did give opportunity to life, which could be perceived as love
[01:59:21] <Parf> you think this is chaotic? also, the order prior to the big bang eh? this isn't chaos, so much as it is a space for potentialities
[01:59:32] <krb> or what was that unsolved math problem called? i think it was 3 variable something
[02:00:27] <krb> how is it not chaotic? i think that if we knew every detail of this universe and tried to simulate the next, we still might not be able to
[02:00:50] <krb> it's like every moment is unpredictable

[02:07:56] <spruit11> so starts at 3
[02:08:00] <Parf> you want chaos to exist to rationalize your nihilism
[02:08:08] <hovercat_> I'm not nihilistic
[02:08:12] <Parf> oh good
[02:08:13] <spruit11> it's just impossible given the math/physics we have
[02:08:17] <hovercat_> I said chaos is love
[02:08:20] <Parf> oh
[02:08:21] <krb> im sure that if in a fantasy-world a god would exist. that it would triumph your genocidal psychopathic scare-god Parf
[02:08:27] <Parf> i thought you were being sarcastic
[02:08:36] <hovercat_> no I was serious
[02:08:58] <hovercat_> without this chaos, otherwise called 'free will' everything would be ordained and nothing would happen the way it does.
[02:09:09] <krb> and im certain that if there was a godfuck-head out there, that it wouldn't destroy a claimed subject of interest forever because of infinitesimal "mistakes"
[02:09:13] <krb> calling them sin or whatever
[02:09:13] <hovercat_> hence you could abstractly look at chaos as love.
[02:09:36] <Parf> well i can get behind that, love manifests however you like, chaos in the "limited sense" like unexplained non-repeating patterns, that are currently unpredictable, say, those sorts of things aren't so hard to imagine
[02:09:47] <krb> so, i bet that in your search. your likely on a self destructive path
[02:09:48] <Parf> but in the grand sense, the universe or whatever you want to call it, isn't chaotic
[02:09:57] <hovercat_> krb: saying God is part of any kind of religion is a big assumption on your end. Not everyone who believes in a 'creator' is bound by a religion.
[02:10:03] <spruit11> we have no idea what the universe is
[02:10:09] <Parf> it's difficult to predict due to current standards (which are getting easier as we speak)
[02:10:09] <hovercat_> ^^
[02:10:21] <Parf> but that doesn't mean it's unpredictable entirely, or impossible
[02:10:58] <spruit11> physics has predictive models which all fail in the limit
[02:11:07] <krb> claim for fantasy gods = a mental suicide
[02:11:09] <spruit11> nobody cares about that
[02:11:26] <Parf> actually, not all, spruit11
[02:11:39] <spruit11> okay,  philosophers do
[02:11:41] <Parf> there are current models which sufficiently explain a lot of problems we faced in the early 2ks
[02:11:48] <spruit11> physicians,  less so
[02:12:01] <Parf> we're making greater and greater strides. how long are we going to shell up against progress i wonder
[02:12:05] <spruit11> uh,  physicists?
[02:12:07] <spruit11> something
[02:12:10] <Parf> the endless demoralizing creep of nihilism!
[02:12:22] <spruit11> it science,  not nihilism
[02:12:33] <spruit11> unless you have a universal theory
[02:12:37] <Parf> it's a philosophy that has tied itself to one window of science
[02:12:43] <krb> just because people doens't let themselves be brainwashed by idiotic god ideas, doesn't mean they have to be nihilistic
[02:12:45] <Parf> science is pluripotent and ever changing, as we are
[02:12:51] <Parf> nihilism is the embrace of naught
[02:13:11] <spruit11> yah,  that totally makes sense
[02:15:35] <krb> there have been surveys showing that the smarter the person, the less likely that person would fall weak for to become a victim of mythological brainwashing
[02:16:17] <Parf> some people are just too damn impatient to believe or even expect that there might be a truth looming behind one of those old rocks passed over by our ancestors, or even that the answers are there for those who toil for them, rather than toss themselves into the void
[02:17:39] <krb> humans are stupid animals, and sometimes tiny changes took thousands of years to evolve. we can't expect too much from our ancestors, as they too had tiny lives to live
[02:18:41] <krb> better to start from scratch with modern tools

[02:30:11] <hovercat_> lack of evidence does not mean a crime didn't happen.
[02:31:52] <spruit11> right,  it could have been true
[02:32:17] <Limbo> disagreeableness is not strongly correlated with intelligence
[02:34:19] <hovercat_> being able to entertain the ideas of someone who you don't agree with is a sign of intelligence

[05:40:02] <causative> the essential meaning of a work is a set of clear, declarative propositions conveyed by the work.  All else is style and status signaling.
[05:41:07] <causative> if the propositions can be determined to be factually true, and of novel value or interest in themselves, then the work's essential meaning is valuable.  Otherwise, it is not.

[05:43:26] <causative> if the essential meaning is wrapped in an allegory, or told in a pleasing way, or littered with literary allusions, this adds only style and status signaling; it does not increase the value or truth of the propositions themselves.
[05:44:32] <plankton> we were talking about this yesterday with the meaning of axioms
[05:44:51] <causative> If the essential meaning is conveyed in a clear and understandable way, this also does not increase the value or truth of the propositions themselves, but it does increase the inherent value of the work as an effective means of transmitting those propositions
[05:45:07] <plankton> id call what youre calling "essential meaning" an axiom
[05:45:49] <causative> no, they need not be axioms - axioms are premises.  If a work of mathematics proves a new theorem, this theorem is not an axiom, but it is part of the essential meaning of the work.
[05:46:05] <plankton> axioms are more than premises, theyre essential truths
[05:46:17] <plankton> theorems are built upon essential truths
[05:46:32] <causative> well, that's not the way I am using the word "essential" here
[05:46:47] <plankton> well then the way youre using it is unclear to me
[05:47:17] <causative> I am using "essential" here in contrast to style and status signaling - the essential meaning is the propositions the work declares are true, whether they are axioms or not
[05:47:50] <plankton> im not seeing the difference between what you describe and a mathematical statement stripped of everything that isnt an essential truth
[05:48:18] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:48:31] <causative> in mathematics, there is a clear distinction between an axiom and a theorem, and the vast majority of papers are about proving theorems, which are not axioms
[05:48:53] <plankton> sure, there arent very many essential truths
[05:49:04] <plankton> most facts are extrapolated from a small set of essential truths
[05:49:13] <causative> do not equivocate over the meaning of "essential"
[05:49:23] <plankton> wasnt aware i was
[05:50:05] <plankton> perhaps a different word would help my understanding
[05:50:10] <causative> the word "essential" can mean many different things.  In this context I have used it to refer to what in a work is not style or status signaling.  You are using it in a different way and saying the two usages are the same.  They are not.
[05:50:32] <plankton> well yes, as i see it they are used the same in both cases
[05:50:35] <causative> the essential meaning of a proof of the ABC hypothesis, would be the ABC hypothesis itself
[05:50:46] <causative> it would not be the axioms of arithmetic used to prove it
[05:51:36] <plankton> but the ABC hypothesis can be reduced to those axioms, no?
[05:51:47] <plankton> thus its not essential
[05:51:58] <plankton> its a logical construction
[05:52:01] <causative> I can't respond to that without repeating myself
[05:52:08] <plankton> i asked if you had a better word
[05:52:10] <plankton> i guess not
[05:52:59] <causative> the word is fine, and means different things in different contexts.  Don't insist it can only be used in one way
[05:53:08] <plankton> im not insisting that
[05:53:20] <plankton> im saying that its equally valid when used either way
[05:53:32] <plankton> and thus is confusing
[05:53:41] <causative> then stop insisting we both use your way, when I introduced it in a clearly different way
[05:53:51] <plankton> please tell me where i insisted you do anything
[05:54:46] <causative> when you began insisting on your meaning of the word as if it were the one I was using
[05:55:03] <plankton> id prefer direct quotes over paraphrasing
[05:55:11] <plankton> fewer misunderstandings that way
[05:55:18] <causative> <plankton> but the ABC hypothesis can be reduced to those axioms, no? <plankton> thus its not essential
[05:55:31] <plankton> is that incorrect?
[05:55:40] <causative> in my usage, the essential meaning of a paper proving the ABC hypothesis, is the ABC hypothesis.  Not the axioms.
[05:56:05] <plankton> so youre saying that the word "essential" can be used to make two conflicting points about the same statement
[05:56:17] <causative> it's two different senses
[05:56:24] <plankton> in response, i say that "essential" is not a great word to describe what youre trying to describe
[05:56:24] <causative> many words can mean different things in different contexts
[05:56:46] <causative> it's a perfectly fine word
[05:56:53] <plankton> i make no judgements about whether or not youre correct
[05:56:53] <causative> and I was perfectly clear about how I was using it
[05:56:59] <plankton> the point you make seems valid enough
[05:57:02] <plankton> but its made confusingly
