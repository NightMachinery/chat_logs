[02:15:10] <Riviera> i received
[02:15:11] <Riviera> today
[02:15:15] <Riviera> my copy of the awk programming language
[02:15:17] <Riviera> :)
[02:25:05] *** Joins: chasmo77 (~chas77@71.63.241.168)
[02:32:35] <geirha> finally you'll get the chance to learn awk!
[02:36:45] <jetchisel> \0/
[02:42:51] <e36freak> hard copy? very nice
[02:43:57] <e36freak> holy crap that's expensive
[02:45:01] <earnestly> Hm, I found one for ~$20
[02:45:09] <earnestly> Not new though heh
[02:45:31] <earnestly> Riviera: You could still maybe get it signed
[02:46:14] <Riviera> yeah mine is used as well
[02:46:17] <Riviera> but i like that
[02:46:28] <Riviera> and signed -- no.
[02:46:48] <earnestly> Riviera: That you don't want it signed?
[02:47:03] <Riviera> i thought about getting Knuth' books signed, but then i might develop the urge to collect signed books
[02:47:09] <earnestly> Yes
[02:47:10] <Riviera> and that's something i better don't even start.
[02:47:31] <earnestly> You won't have the option for very much longer
[02:48:15] <earnestly> Collecting signed books is not a terrible investment
[02:48:25] <Riviera> :)
[02:48:41] <Riviera> you are certainly correct with everything you say here, and these are good recommendations,
[02:48:51] <earnestly> Hm
[02:48:56] <Riviera> but i am just not the type of person who does things like that; i do not care for signatures / autographs
[02:49:15] <Riviera> and i would not want to sell these things either
[02:49:18] <earnestly> But it is the most human aspect
[02:49:38] <Riviera> so is this a test to determine whether i am a dog on the internet?
[02:49:45] <Riviera> bawk bawk
[02:51:25] <earnestly> Well, we're all living in the ashes, so I shouldn't be surprised
[02:51:43] <earnestly> I can't remember that auction site, I wondered if they had any programming books at all
[02:52:06] <Riviera> living in the ashes sounds holocausty
[02:52:45] <Riviera> that "weird" site with webdesign from the 90ies selling art and stuff? :)
[02:53:58] <earnestly> e36freak: New hardcovers are about ~$200-$300, not signed
[02:54:46] <earnestly> Riviera: No, it's a bit like christies but for books.  The high stuff there would go for ~£50,000+
[02:54:55] <Riviera> mh
[02:54:57] <earnestly> They do have lots of stuff for not that much though
[02:55:32] <earnestly> iirc, 1911 encyclopedia britannica for ~£2500
[02:55:42] <Riviera> i remember when i was hunting for books in antiquarian bookstores
[02:56:04] <Riviera> yeah often thought about getting the 1911 one
[02:56:14] <Riviera> but the scans will have to do for now :)
[02:56:17] <earnestly> Fortunately archive.org has copies
[02:56:19] <earnestly> Yeah
[02:57:01] <Riviera> there was a time where you could get a reasonably preserved copy for less than that,
[02:57:16] <Riviera> the internet made all of that more expensive, and also a bit less exciting :)
[02:57:39] <earnestly> You can get them still but they're often a bit worn or missing volumes (or people who have duplicates just to fill it out on a bookshelf)
[02:58:12] <Riviera> iirc it was a bit hard to get these three supplement volumes
[02:58:41] <earnestly> I haven't even thought about there being supplements lol
[02:58:44] <Riviera> but it's been almost 2 decades that i was really into that
[02:59:08] <earnestly> They are also to look beautiful on a bookshelf, to be fair
[02:59:43] <Riviera> i have too many books, so that's not really my goal here :)
[02:59:59] <earnestly> So long as you don't arrange them by colour or size
[03:00:41] <e36freak> yeah i already have plenty of books that i've actually read or want to read
[03:00:45] <Riviera> well, sometimes you are forced to that due to constraints of shelf heights ;)
[03:00:50] <e36freak> don't need an old encyclopedia to sit there and look good
[03:01:14] <Riviera> e36freak: the 1911 is a nice read though
[03:01:24] <e36freak> i'm sure it is
[03:01:41] <e36freak> no shelf space.
[03:01:45] <Riviera> yeah
[03:02:11] <Riviera> can't afford a second annex to the library can one anymore

[20:40:15] <Entelin> is there an array equivilent of $1,$2... id like to save a bunch of stuff into vars as such:  for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) f[i]=$f[i];   is something like $f[i] a thing?

[20:41:39] <wstrnr> the split("...", array) function splits a string and puts parts into array as distinct elements
[20:42:43] <wstrnr> # awk 'BEGIN { x="hello there pal"; cnt = split(x, parts); for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) print i ": <" parts[i] ">" }'
[20:42:45] <shbot> wstrnr: 1: <hello>
[20:42:45] <shbot> wstrnr: 2: <there>
[20:42:45] <shbot> wstrnr: 3: <pal>
[20:43:15] <wstrnr> so parts is array, and you can apply subscript operator to it to get its elements
[20:43:27] <wstrnr> is this what you wanted?
[20:44:35] <wstrnr> the third parameter to split() specifies the separator, so it can be a comma or anything else, not just space
[20:44:37] <Entelin> so like count = split($0, parts);  ?
[20:44:51] <Entelin> i assume split uses FS ?
[20:47:13] <Entelin> "If fieldsep is omitted, the value of FS is used. split()"
[20:47:15] <Entelin> yup
[20:47:19] <wstrnr> "if FILDESEP [parameter] is omitted, the value of FS is used."
[20:47:20] <wstrnr> yes.
[20:47:43] <Entelin> ok thanks
[20:58:00] <emanuele6> you can access $1,$2,$3,$4,... with a variable
[20:58:04] <emanuele6> # awk -vi=2 '{print $i}' <<< 'a b c'
[20:58:06] <shbot> emanuele6: b
[20:58:10] <emanuele6> # awk -vi=3 '{print $i}' <<< 'a b c'
[20:58:11] <shbot> emanuele6: c
[20:58:19] <emanuele6> why do you need an array?
[20:58:45] <emanuele6> / why do you need to recreate an array?
[20:59:31] <wstrnr> idk, imho, the objective here is just to copy data in another place
[20:59:51] <wstrnr> why do people copy contents of one array into another?  for business
[21:01:23] <Entelin> i'm saving fields from a previous line for use on the next line
[21:02:21] <emanuele6> then you want: for (i=0;i<=NF;i++) f[i]=$i
