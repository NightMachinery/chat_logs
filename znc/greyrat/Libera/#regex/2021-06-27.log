[01:33:29] <Midnite> Hi, I'm trying to get a list of all words in a string. So far, I have this:
[01:33:31] <Midnite> \b([A-Za-z]*)\b
[01:33:45] <Midnite> But this seems to also return the spaces in between the words, which I do not want.
[01:34:01] <Midnite> Can someone point me in the right direction without just giving me the answer?
[01:37:58] <Midnite> \b([A-Za-z]+)\b seems to work :)
[01:39:21] <Midnite> or the simpler [A-Za-z]+ seems to work as well
[02:08:29] <rewt> most regex engines have a case-insensitive flag, so that could be further simplified to [a-z]+
[02:10:12] <rewt> you may (or may not) also want to include ' in that character class, for contractions, possesives, etc
[02:11:06] <Midnite> and that may have fixed my bug :)
[02:16:22] <Midnite> How do I match only the first occurence of a character in a class?
[02:16:48] <Midnite> never mind
[02:21:18] *** Quits: FightingFalcon (~sdasavcsg@user/fightingfalcon) ()
[02:22:22] <Midnite> [.!?]+ seems to do what I want :)
[02:22:31] <Midnite> regex is powerful :o
[02:23:23] <rewt> [.!?]+ will match groups of one or more consecutive characters that are either . or ! or ?
[02:30:19] <Midnite> what if I wanted to return groups of characters seperated by spaces?
[02:30:54] <Midnite> so kind of the inverse of [ ]
[02:31:52] <Midnite> [^ ]+ seems to work?

[22:32:21] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-9 that part is clear but my question remains: is that your whole HTML? And how do you pick the 10th and 20th? based on what criteria?
[22:34:00] <re101-zorse-9> That is not my whole html but I want all the searching to stop at the first `</ol>`

[22:36:02] <re101-zorse-9> yes
[22:38:10] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-9 did you know you only have 18 <li tags in that HTML snippet?

[23:52:29] <re101-zorse-970> and replace with `<li style="padding: 0px; margin-left: 1px; text-indent: -35px; list-style-type: decimal; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: inside; font-family: &quot;verdana&quot;; font-size: 18px; color: black;">`
[23:53:13] <re101-zorse-970> 10th to 20th (and skip the first 9)
[23:53:29] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 you're in the same channel with the same people, repeating it won't do anything other than waste your time ;)
[23:53:36] <JohnDoe2> give me a few seconds please
[23:55:44] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 https://bugout.regex.ga/9ed6f7e794f6a941bf7d34ce3d69ff4b_the-actual-problem.png there it is. Using regex to do this is going to fix it, but like your lumbago link, it's not quite there and it's the wrong problem to fix.
[23:56:06] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 what you need is to remove the css handling that's crossed out at the bottom right
[23:59:02] <re101-zorse-970> that ain't in the css, I have put that in every <li tag
[23:59:18] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 https://regex101.com/r/Wwu5Mg/5 that's basically what you need. 
[23:59:22] <re101-zorse-970> so I need to replace that
