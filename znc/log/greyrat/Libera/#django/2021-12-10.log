[08:23:08] <schinckel> Hi
[08:23:32] <audio> i have a sidebar on which i want to display all Pages that have been dynamically created in the database
[08:24:00] <pembo13> audio, ok
[08:24:09] <audio> problem is that i would have to define a "pages" dict or list in the context for every view
[08:24:33] <pembo13> or you can use a custom tag, or introduce a context processor
[08:24:35] <audio> whats the best course of action for having all Page instances being accessible anywhere in the app? i know i can do something involving context processors
[08:24:54] <audio> ok thanks
[08:24:58] <pembo13> you'd definitely want to produce a query set so that it's only evaluated when needed however

[09:01:04] <schemefusion> I don't see any contraint statements, however.  Does it mean Django does not support them?
[09:01:40] <pembo13> correct... if you have specific examples, I may be able to point to relevant docs, but I suspect it's there

[09:07:25] <pembo13> cool... you'll probably not want to rely on creating tables by hand though... unless those tables exist separate from what you're building
[09:08:30] <schemefusion> I did sketchy libs (like a proof of concept) in Python and Postgresql alone (no UI). It worked quite well.  Eventually, Users are not developers (hence, a GUI = Django)
[09:08:59] <pembo13> cool, good luck with your dev
[09:11:39] <schemefusion> pembo13: learning to do it the django way though.  So, yes, ... I'll be creating the tables all over via models.  I just wanted to be sure some things are dynamic (like use of characer length constraints on text data types rather than using varchar types).

[16:37:42] <theprophet> is it possible to autosave request/response in database with django?
[16:38:52] <GinFuyou> theprophet, what that would even mean? You can save any data if you wish, but what does it achieve?
[16:40:03] <theprophet> GinFuyou remember yesterday u taught me how to do templates? i was pulling some other api link ?
[16:40:14] <GinFuyou> Yes
[16:40:32] <theprophet> so link was just random jokes from chuck norris api
[16:40:45] <GinFuyou> Do you want to cache the response (e.g. a joke, so you don't fetch api on every load)?
[16:40:47] <theprophet> and i was wondering if it is possbile to save those jokes in database
[16:41:21] <theprophet> i think so? yea? GinFuyou
[16:42:21] <GinFuyou> Sure. But you probably want to save exactly jokes (Joke model?) to database. That is if you goal is saving them. Cache usually won't use database or store data permanently
[16:43:03] <theprophet> let me rephrase what  they are asking of me to do
[16:44:58] <theprophet> there such a public API https://api.chucknorris.io/ which is random
[16:44:59] <theprophet> Returns jokes about Chuck Norris. Write your API on any Python web
[16:44:59] <theprophet> in a framework such as Django, Flask, FastAPI or any other
[16:45:00] <theprophet> With the following endpoints
[16:45:18] <theprophet> And save locally (you can save to sqlite database either
[16:45:18] <theprophet> In a text file in any format). It is necessary to save
[16:45:19] <theprophet> At least the joke text.
[16:45:38] <theprophet> b./saved_joks which returns all locally stored
[16:45:39] <theprophet> Joke (from database or file, depending on where it stores first
[16:45:39] <theprophet> Endpoint) in JSON format
[16:46:27] <GinFuyou> Aha, yes it's clear now
[16:46:37] <theprophet> i did the rest exept the B
[16:46:47] <theprophet> expept this
[16:46:48] <theprophet> b./saved_joks which returns all locally stored
[16:46:49] <theprophet> Joke (from database or file, depending on where it stores first
[16:46:49] <theprophet> Endpoint) in JSON format
[16:47:32] <GinFuyou> Good approach for django would be a Joke model, storing more data than just text (probably all the data you get fro API, unless you find some useless for you)
[16:47:48] <theprophet> yea
[16:48:34] <theprophet> and now i am trying to save those jokes
[16:48:36] <GinFuyou> Then you can use a modelform to validate the data from api (yes you can use forms for that too!) and save it in same code you retrieve it
[16:49:08] <GinFuyou> you may want a API id of joke, so you don't save same joke more than once
[16:49:17] <theprophet> i see
[16:49:51] <theprophet> so it is possible to save those random jokes automaticly
[16:50:10] <GinFuyou> well, you have to write code for that
[16:50:13] <theprophet> yea
[16:50:17] <theprophet> of course
[16:50:23] <GinFuyou> but then, it can be automatic yes
[16:50:53] <theprophet> ok, thanks gin, ill try to find, what i can do
[16:51:15] <theprophet> can u just tell me 1 thing
[16:51:24] <theprophet> keywords for google ?
[16:51:26] <GinFuyou> Joke model, then a ModelForm based on it
[16:51:35] <GinFuyou> Actually, look in official tutorial
[16:51:46] <theprophet> do you remember which page?
[16:52:07] <GinFuyou> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models
[16:52:38] <theprophet> this whole page ?
[16:52:42] <theprophet> or just that particular part?
[16:53:07] <GinFuyou> You will have to look at api data and design a model that matches it (or at least the parts you want)
[16:53:22] <theprophet> i see
[16:53:26] <GinFuyou> Well, if you want to learn django you better do the whole tutorial

[16:53:40] <theprophet> i actually already did like 2
[16:53:42] <theprophet> times
[16:53:43] <GinFuyou> The particalar part will probably get you started on models
[16:54:09] <GinFuyou> Well, then you should know about models
[16:54:17] <theprophet> yes
[16:54:23] <theprophet> but that saving things from apis
[16:54:29] <theprophet>  i never seen it there
[16:54:44] <mad_moses> Hi, any idea why put RetrieveUpdateAPIView https://dpaste.org/tGqk is not working here? Do I miss something? (I get no error)
[16:54:59] <GinFuyou> Ok, I see. It's actually not much different than saving from user input
[16:55:08] <GinFuyou> for modelforms: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/
[16:55:10] <theprophet> oh really?
[16:55:17] <theprophet> okk thaats nice
[16:55:22] *** Joins: gitly (~gitly@148.252.133.169)
[16:55:35] <GinFuyou> Yes, with user input you usually do "form = MyForm(request.POST)"
[16:56:02] <theprophet> yes yes, oh oh thats very nice.
[16:56:22] <GinFuyou> but argument to form init can be any data, e.g. dict, like one you get from your api (after parsing from jsob)
[16:56:25] <GinFuyou> *json

[16:57:22] <GinFuyou> but in case of forms field names either have to match your model, or you have to do matching yourself
[16:57:46] <theprophet> i see
[16:58:15] <GinFuyou> looking on the api data, I suggest you match fields all except "id". Because django has own "id" autofield
[16:58:38] <theprophet> that makes sense
[16:59:15] <GinFuyou> you could save url instead, or covert api's "id" into own api_id field for example
[16:59:48] <theprophet> does url saving works as same?
[16:59:55] <theprophet> same logic?
[17:00:33] <theprophet> cause thats actually a better idea
[17:01:50] <GinFuyou> there is url field in django, anyway at base url is just text data
[17:01:56] <theprophet> aha

[17:02:09] <theprophet> i see
[17:02:19] <hylje> lots of things are text fields with validation

[17:03:15] <hylje> surprising amount of data is text

[18:39:14] <b-rex> what's a commonly used method to perform arbitrary actions when a user logs in, regardless of how they login (e.g. into admin, or via dj-rest-auth, etc.) ?
[18:41:01] <b-rex> i'd also like to be able to pass an extra parameter at login in addition to username/password. (not two factor auth stuff)
[18:41:27] <GinFuyou> Customize backend I guess?
[18:41:41] <bparker> can't you just override login() ?
[18:41:54] <bparker> the extra param would be part of the login page template
[18:42:17] <b-rex> customize backend sounds like the possible right way to go.

[18:46:20] <GinFuyou> But I didn't touch this for quite some time, so can't say for sure
[18:47:39] <GinFuyou> also, I think there was a login signal? But it only solves action on login, and signals generally not adviced except a few specific cases
[18:48:40] <b-rex> from what i'm reading it looks like I can run a backend in tandem with the existing backends, which is perfect. reading more.

[20:27:35] <pycode> pardon for asking a stupid question but what is the criteria to use to manage the templates correctly? i mean... iknow that i can put my templates inside a folder called /templates on the root of my project.... OR.... put the templates/ folder inside my app
[20:27:49] <pycode> when do you put templates in the main folder instead of the /templates inside the app ?
[20:29:48] <dodo> pycode: app templates in apps, project templates in root
[20:30:06] <GinFuyou> theprophet, I think https://dpaste.org/TzQc#L27 is copy mistake?
[20:30:22] <GinFuyou> Anyway, your model is likely not what you want
[20:30:24] <dodo> pycode: for me project templates are usually base.html, 404.html etc
[20:30:53] <theprophet> GinFuyou ahh yea dont mind the first def. its a copy mistake yes
[20:31:14] <theprophet> 27 line is just ignore that
[20:31:40] <GinFuyou> Ok, what you tried to achieve with ForeignKey field on the model?
[20:31:47] <theprophet> also fixed form = svd_jokes(request.post) post suppose to be POST
[20:32:04] <GinFuyou> it's wrong anyway ^_^"
[20:32:10] <pycode> dodo, i just wonder if is better to move the templates inside the templates inside the project /templates folder to separate the view from the design, so that way i can change the theme just changing the template_name inside the views instead of replacing the apps /templates
[20:32:54] <Eadwulf> pycode, keep app templates y app directory, so you have the app encapsulated. If you want to share the app or use it in other projects, the only things to set will be the projects urls for that particular app.
[20:32:59] <theprophet> ok well , with foreign key i tried to assign a ID to a jokes, so it would not repeate
[20:33:06] <theprophet> i mean to not save same joke
[20:33:08] <theprophet> twice
[20:33:29] <GinFuyou> theprophet, no, it doesn't solve that. ForeignKey is reference to _another_ object
[20:33:38] <theprophet> i see
[20:33:50] <theprophet> ill do charfield then
[20:34:00] <GinFuyou> as I said you can use an url or api id
[20:34:02] *** Quits: abrantesasf (~abrantesa@187.36.170.211) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:34:10] <GinFuyou> 1. make model fields that match data in api (field names == dict keys)
[20:34:24] <GinFuyou> 2. feed api data to form (instead of request.POST)
[20:34:33] <pycode> Eadwulf, you are right, in that case i can move the entire app without changing anything (if i leave all the templates INSIDE the app templates)
[20:34:53] <pycode> but what happen if i need to change .html of the app? i mean...use a different THEME for the same app ?
[20:35:01] <pycode> is better to put this theme INSIDE the app too ?
[20:35:19] <theprophet> GinFuyou 2) like request.FORM?
[20:35:28] <pycode> like app_name/templates/theme1/base.html or app_name/templates/theme2/base.html
[20:35:29] <pycode> and so on
[20:36:37] <GinFuyou> theprophet, no. What var has data from an api? Use it

[20:37:30] <theprophet> GinFuyou you mean Value?
[20:37:36] <dodo> pycode: theme sounds like a css thing
[20:38:36] <pycode> dodo, a kind of, i mean, if i would like to change the templates i mean...i should leave a new theme there (inside the app) instead of the main folder
[20:38:40] <pycode> *project folder
[20:40:28] <GinFuyou> theprophet, no, just look at your code. Which is part that gets api data? Where it's assigned?
[20:40:41] <theprophet> response
[20:41:00] <GinFuyou> Right =)
[20:41:14] <theprophet> ok done
[20:42:15] <theprophet> GinFuyou https://dpaste.org/Zmib
[20:43:35] <GinFuyou> https://dpaste.org/Zmib#L2,6,7,8 well, those are not needed. It's for more common case when form expects POST data, our case is simpler
[20:43:36] <theprophet> hmm getting invalid syntax error on  if = request.method == 'response':
[20:44:10] <GinFuyou> also you api code should happen before you use the response data
[20:44:19] <theprophet> ahh

[20:45:08] <theprophet> i see
[20:45:56] <theprophet> https://dpaste.org/qaQ3 this is how it suppose to look? GinFuyou
[20:46:48] <theprophet> fixed spacing on if
[20:46:59] <theprophet> indent
[20:47:55] <GinFuyou> not yet. `return` will exit your function, so it will now never reach your form code
[20:48:06] <GinFuyou> move return to the end
[20:49:07] <GinFuyou> after it basic view code would be done, could have some improvements though
[20:49:22] <GinFuyou> next question would be model
[20:50:12] <theprophet> ok
[20:50:49] <theprophet> this is model so far https://dpaste.org/sgOT
[20:52:22] <theprophet> got only 1 field tho. since api is on random mode
[20:52:29] <theprophet> that chuck norris thing
[20:55:12] <Eadwulf> pycode, if the theme is just for the app, then yes, because is a template (or style) for than particular. If the theme if for the whole project, the should put it in the project's template directory.
[20:55:29] <pycode> Eadwulf, ok!

[21:05:38] <GinFuyou> well, that is important part... what 'saved' supposed to be? joke text? If so, you want to name it "value" so it automatically pulled by that key from data
[21:06:34] <GinFuyou> Also make sure that joke are fit in you max_lenght. If api has long jokes, TextField is better (it's doesn't require max_length)
[21:06:44] <theprophet> yea , minimum what save has to do is save the joke text
[21:07:14] <theprophet> atleast joke text
[21:09:27] <theprophet> GinFuyou name it? you mean model field or ?
[21:09:54] <theprophet> name value where? like db or in views value for save?

[21:15:35] <theprophet> GinFuyou ok, thank you, its just , i wanted to know, when you said name it value, where do you mean naming it value, you mean model field or variable for save()?

[21:19:24] <GinFuyou> theprophet, model field. When you send dict to form, it will match dict keys to field names of corresponding model (in form.Meta)

[21:19:54] <theprophet> ok thank you
[21:22:08] <GinFuyou> I think it will even already handle duplicate jokes, unique=True on api_id should fail form.is_valid() check I beleive
[21:23:13] <theprophet> thanks, i am looking at it right now

[21:29:58] <theprophet> any key?
[21:32:45] <GinFuyou> no this key. We don'y use "id" because it clashes with django "id" field
[21:33:17] <GinFuyou> So I copy key "id" from api as "api_id" to match our field
[21:33:53] <theprophet> ohh ohh, makes sense,  response['api_id'] = response['id'] got it.
