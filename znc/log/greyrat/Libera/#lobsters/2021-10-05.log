[02:12:36] <imode> because there's no competition that's universally adopted.

[02:23:08] <ignaloidas> if I'd be a shareholder I'd demand a post-mortem, just to see if they are serious about fixing their procedures so this can't happen again
[02:23:15] <demize> There will always be people moving back and forth, but if if just a small set of key groups start moving to alternative platforms, those people will cause a small fraction of more people to move, and as such small fractions add up over time they would make a large difference to their bottom line.
[02:24:11] <demize> Sure, but most shareholders wouldn't demand it be published publicly, unless it has a very low risk of causing any ill effects to their revenue.
[02:24:44] <demize> Would require a pretty significant chance of it having a positive impact on their revenue for shareholders to demand such a thing.

[02:27:37] <ignaloidas> I mean, they have bad press already anyways
[02:27:43] <dimadima> i personally know several aunts who are going to Parler because of this
[02:27:48] <ignaloidas> a post-mortem can relieve it

[02:28:14] <demize> It doesn't matter that they already have bad press or not though.  It's more bad press.
[02:28:33] <demize> And small things multiply over time.
[02:28:46] <demize> Compound bad press?  :p
[02:29:17] <ignaloidas> dunno, the post-mortems from cloudflare were generally recieved well, even though it got a ton of bad press
[02:29:35] <demize> What kind of news outlets talked about the details of those?
[02:30:19] <dimadima> none
[02:30:23] <ignaloidas> tech outlets I think

[02:30:32] <dimadima> ^
[02:30:52] <ignaloidas> that's cloudflare speaking what it saw today
[02:31:14] <demize> That's my point though.  Companies like Cloudflare and AWS don't provide services that are directly used by end users.  Facebook does.
[02:31:50] <dimadima> i agree with drobilla that anyone who's still on FB isn't going away cause of this. if anything it added a little spice to their experience and made them realize how important FB is to their daily lives
[02:31:51] <ignaloidas> demize, if they put it under their tech blog no reporter will see it
[02:31:54] <demize> So the Facebook share price is much more affected by the population at large.
[02:32:11] <ignaloidas> dimadima, unless it was delibarate malice
[02:32:26] <ignaloidas> demize, so there's no reason for them not to publish it
[02:32:28] <dimadima> ignaloidas and then what?
[02:32:51] <dimadima> then it's just more interesting
[02:33:02] <ignaloidas> if it was malice, you probably got a lawsuit

[02:34:37] *** Joins: gera (~gera@user/gera)
[02:34:47] <ignaloidas> if it does a post-mortem, mainstream will probably not understand it at all, and tech outlets will report positively
[02:35:17] <demize> If the end users won't care about any such transparency, why would the shareholders care about one being published?
[02:35:48] <demize> Cloudflare sells services to techy people, so for them the opinions of techy people is their bottom line.
[02:36:21] <demize> But why would Facebook really care?
[02:36:22] <ignaloidas> demize, they are selling to developers as well
[02:36:33] <ignaloidas> they are selling plenty of services
[02:36:49] <ignaloidas> advertising, data, "applications"
[02:37:02] <demize> They're selling those because of the platform though.  Those developers are buying the services because that's where the users are.
[02:37:28] <ignaloidas> demize, why they wouldn't publish a post-mortem though
[02:37:34] <ignaloidas> what is the reason?
[02:37:43] <demize> Well, why would they?
[02:38:06] <ignaloidas> to gain street cred across developers?
[02:38:09] <demize> I've stated my opinions on how I think the shareholders would act.
[02:38:27] <ignaloidas> shareholders will prefer it
[02:38:31] <demize> They don't need any such cred though.
[02:38:35] <demize> Why would they?
[02:38:55] <ignaloidas> demize, they have high personel rotation
[02:39:05] <ignaloidas> you need cred to keep employees coming in
[02:39:27] <drobilla> It seems like we're assuming here that they'd publish a post-mortem that makes them look especially incompetent?
[02:39:37] <drobilla> Which... seems like quite an assumption
[02:39:44] <demize> I don't see how not publishing an in-depth postmortem would be worse to employee retention compared to the actively atrocious things they're doing.
[02:40:02] <demize> drobilla: No, that's what I've been arguing that they wouldn't do.
[02:40:32] <drobilla> demize: What I mean is, if that's the case, they'll lie
[02:42:22] <demize> > 00:32:21 <demize> They'll definitely publish something, yes.  But whether it'll actually be something you could reasonably classify as a postmortem...   \o/
[02:42:24] <demize> I agree.

[02:44:48] <demize> No, I think they probably will publish something, but I don't think the shareholders would care one bit.
[02:45:01] <drobilla> Also I wanted to ease in to a "this is a company that famously lies under oath, so..." line :)
[02:45:09] <demize> :)
[02:45:39] <drobilla> On that I disagree, I think.  "Shareholders" are the most fickle thing in the universe.  Down, what, 5%, /today/?
[02:46:28] <demize> Sure, but why would they care about a postmortem being published?
[02:46:49] <demize> Because I can't see them not publishing a postmortem affecting the share price.
[02:47:06] <drobilla> Because clearly confidence in their ability to run the operation very directly translates to falling share price, which is the only thing they care about
[02:47:27] <ignaloidas> them publishing a postmortem is a canary that they are doing things right
[02:47:42] <ignaloidas> if they no longer publish a postmortem, something bad is happening
[02:47:44] <demize> drobilla: I don't see what that has to do with publishing a postmortem.
[02:47:58] <drobilla> 5% of Facebook is a double-digit billions kind of thing
[02:48:20] <demize> ignaloidas: If a reporter wouldn't be able to find it, I don't think most of the shareholders would be able to find out if they'd published one either.
[02:48:50] <ignaloidas> demize, I expect it being mentioned on the next shareholder call
[02:48:51] <drobilla> I think it's more accurate to think of this as a sort of rumour mill
[02:49:30] <ignaloidas> and just mentioning "we have a post-mortem you can read in detail" is something they'll be waiting to head
[02:49:37] <ignaloidas> *hear
[02:49:40] <drobilla> It's not like John. D. Shareholder directly cares about technical post-mortems.  But things get around in subtle and indirect ways...
[02:49:40] <demize> ignaloidas: I really don't think it would be, personally.  One would probably be provided for said call, but I don't think they'd talk about whether it was published or not.
[02:50:22] <drobilla> This is all one giant casino, after all
[02:50:24] <ignaloidas> I mean, shareholder calls of a company that scale are basically public anyways
[02:51:14] <ignaloidas> and technical people won't be listening to the call, investors will ask somebody who knows tech about it

[02:54:47] <goodger> it's about $50 billion
[02:55:41] <demize> And because of that, I don't think them not publishing a postmortem would be a thing they would care much about.

[13:59:11] <kline> jabley, post mortems arent only for users
[13:59:31] <kline> but also for potential employees (look how well we do incident recovery, look at our stack), regulators, etc
[14:00:21] <kline> theres also Facebook Workplace where the customers will presumably want to know what facebook is doing to prevent another outage of their paid-for service
[14:02:08] <kline> since the post-mortem is already getting done, its almost cost-free to post it publicly, in a simplified and redacted form
[14:03:32] <wink> that depends on the company
[14:03:47] <wink> if it's a codified blaming then it needs to be rewritten ;)
[14:03:52] <jabley> I don't disagree. But I think the reasons for publishing a post-mortem, rather than the internal exercises, are different for Facebook versus Cloudflare or Fastly, for instance.
[14:04:26] <jabley> I'm sure there might be nice conference talks and other stuff later on about it, but that's again for quite a niche audience.

[15:47:12] <epilys> haha nice
[15:47:22] <wink> but I have not actually met the people. a former customer of my old company was supposed to have their key systems written in cobol, that was 10-15y ago
[15:47:40] <wink> everything was wrapped up in layers of java and php
[15:47:52] <wink> so COBOL only did the core stuff, probably 80s/70s roots
[15:48:06] <wink> I suppose they only had a few people on maintenance there
[15:51:23] <southclaws> yeah from what I hear it's similar in most places,  cobol business logic, slightly more modern tech around the edges
[15:51:43] <southclaws> modern being java 6 most likely

[19:04:42] <ngoldbaum> xojoc: also just in general best to stick to original sources instead of using a reposting service like outline.com
[19:05:42] <goodger> or they try to redefine ‘brigading’...
[19:06:05] <cot> That said... it was a good article, it's a real shame the domain is banned :V
[19:06:37] <pushcx> xojoc: Devault's domain and user account got banned because he was constantly starting flamewars. He seems to have decided to tone it down lately so maybe at least the domain ban could be reversed in a bit when it semes like a solid thing.
[19:07:06] <pushcx> But even aside from that, he's asked explicitly a bunch of times that people not post about his language to aggregators like HN and Lobsters and we might as well be polite about not doing that.
[19:07:45] <cot> pushcx: No, that was him asking people to not post the kinda-secret-but-not-really-secret langauge domain.
[19:07:52] <cot> Posts on his public blog are fair game.
[19:07:59] <ignaloidas> companion_cube, I can tell that the reasons he thinks that reflection is fine for the languages is because it helps to build better tooling for it and allows some simplification of the programs (e.g. the strenum utility at the end)

[19:17:08] <ignaloidas> companion_cube, yeah, I personally don't agree with him on that, but his reasoning is that you are better off building one-off structures for everything optimized for a specific usecase than to trust somebody's code to work in your case

[21:39:47] <deadk> i don't care about the cost of shipping stuff that's not used; i know how to use my linker. i didn't know anyone did care. i think the cost of depending on things is mostly in supply-chain attack surface

[21:40:52] <companion_cube> deadk: why not? what's wrong?
[21:40:55] <shapr> I guess I should do my own research?
[21:40:59] <c355e3b> I generally pull in libraries for small functions that need to drop to very low level instruction magic to make it work
[21:41:05] <deadk> companion_cube: the problem is where the code comes from, not where it is now
[21:41:07] <technomancy> shapr: I think the term you want to search for is "tree shaking"
[21:41:13] <shapr> technomancy: oh thanks!
[21:41:24] <companion_cube> deadk: as opposed to which language then?
[21:41:26] <c355e3b> shapr, most languages don't "tree shake". C/C++/ObjC can with the right keyword.
[21:41:38] <shapr> c355e3b: sounds like I have much to learn about this subject!
[21:41:40] <technomancy> the only compiler I use that has it is microscheme

[21:41:59] <mockturtle> [ Tree shaking - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[21:42:08] <companion_cube> deadk: you can do as much with rust's stdlib as with C, imho
[21:42:15] <shapr> I think Haskell had this feature for a decade or two
[21:42:17] <companion_cube> so… where's the difference?
[21:42:20] <c355e3b> Go doesn't nor does python
[21:42:27] <companion_cube> python has a large stdlib for sure.

[21:44:36] <cot> nice
[21:44:36] <deadk> companion_cube: rust's stdlib has more, but you can get most of what you need in C from stuff that's bundled with the OS you're targeting. and C libraries tend not to depend on lots of other libraries
[21:44:58] <gwozniak> dead code elimination is usually not done on the whole program

[21:45:54] <deadk> companion_cube: OS bundled stuff was in the OS anyway. if it's evil then it's evil, but i didn't increase anyone's exposure by depending on it
[21:46:13] <deadk> vendored stuff is equivalent to any other depended-on stuff
[21:46:28] <shapr> I'll drop some drafts in here for 'discussion'
[21:46:30] <companion_cube> but you can read the code easily if it's vendored
[21:46:34] * shapr gets the flameproof clothing ready
[21:46:41] <gwozniak> deadk: function elimination will generally only happen within a compilation unit, especially when dynamic linking is used
[21:47:33] <gwozniak> More complicated linking/loading schemes can get rid of stuff, mind you
[21:47:40] <deadk> it can't happen within a compilation unit really
[21:47:54] <deadk> you need to link before you know what's not referenced
[21:48:05] <gwozniak> You can ditch static functions if their addresses are never used
[21:48:19] <gwozniak> That is, non-extern ones
[21:48:44] <deadk> yeah but that's not really anything special
[21:48:49] <gwozniak> No, it's not
[21:49:23] <gwozniak> Code elimination is most effective when you are doing whole program analysis
[21:49:34] <deadk> yes, but it's a different thing
[21:50:01] <gwozniak> "code" meaning both code in a function and entire functions themselves
[21:50:43] <deadk> i'm not really sure what you mean about dynamic linking. obviously when you dynamically link a library you can't remove anything from the libraries you're linking to because you don't have them yet
[21:51:03] <deadk> with stuff i've worked on removing statically linked functions that are never used is a pretty standard thing to do
[21:51:21] <deadk> even if you don't have source for them and can't do whole-program optimisation
[21:52:09] <gwozniak> Yes, that's what I'm mostly referring to. It's also one of the most effective ways to reduce code size

[21:52:39] <gwozniak> "code elimination", to me, encompasses all levels
[21:52:42] <deadk> companion_cube: so i still feel like vendoring or just depending is an irrelevance. but in any case i think that npm-style dependencies tend to be far less attackable than C ones because transitive dependency trees in C are usually nonexistent and pretty much always fairly small

[22:00:58] <deadk> i do think rust is the objectively correct choice for most new things that would have been written in C btw

[22:02:11] <companion_cube> specifying each dep by hand is doable, but I think the rust people wanted to have small reusable libraries
[22:02:14] <deadk> companion_cube: bigger standard library
[22:02:30] <companion_cube> they don't want dead batteries, like python
[22:02:42] <rhn> C doesn't have a big standard library either
[22:03:15] <cot> But still doesn't have an npm-esque package economy because of the lack of a standard package manager.
[22:03:20] <deadk> yeah
[22:03:21] <rhn> I think the problem is that Rust join something like pkg-config, where multiple languages can meet and interoperate
[22:03:35] <companion_cube> pkg-config is only for C, isn't it?
[22:03:39] <rhn> *does not
[22:03:39] <companion_cube> and it's super limited
[22:03:44] <companion_cube> you can't have a .a for rust
[22:03:48] <rhn> no, it's for anything with a C ABI
[22:04:00] <companion_cube> which is not rust's case
[22:04:08] <companion_cube> a rust library is a lot richer than the C ABI
[22:04:11] <rhn> Rust can export a C ABI all right
[22:04:19] <companion_cube> yes
[22:04:25] <deadk> C has ended up with a largeish body of libraries with very stable interfaces that you can depend on for most things. but you can't just pull that out of the air. i think a big standard library is the next best thing
[22:04:26] <companion_cube> but you can't expect a rust library to be only C ABI
[22:04:42] <rhn> sure, but that's not what you want when you care about interoperability anyway
[22:05:00] <deadk> python's dead batteries may annoy the python maintainers but i don't think they pose any problems to python programmers
[22:05:17] <companion_cube> python is usable in fewer places than rust, though
[22:05:19] <companion_cube> e.g. no wasm
[22:05:26] <companion_cube> no #[no_std] (ofc)
[22:05:38] <jabley> deadk: rustls seems to be useful and auditable. See https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/master/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf

[22:09:23] <deadk> jabley: rustls is useful; it also has a lot of dependencies that aren't mentioned here

[22:10:11] <deadk> companion_cube: for sure, but everything in python's stdlib could be implemented in rust
[22:10:25] <companion_cube> sure
[22:10:55] <companion_cube> it's just that the rust people decided it was better to not lock a given implementation of $foo in the stdlib, because the ecosystem would provide several alternatives
[22:11:12] <companion_cube> I think it's a bit extreme when it comes to random generators, but otherwise it makes sense
[22:11:32] <companion_cube> (e.g. the error handling stuff has evolved a lot compared to what was used at rust 1.0)
[22:12:15] <rhn> manicennui: presumably because npm goes through no checks at all, and C is hard to write already
[22:12:26] <rhn> distros at least pick packages with some decent reputation
[22:12:34] <manicennui> No they don't.
[22:12:52] <varjag> manicennui: you have to watch your back in c
[22:12:57] * rhn looks at my libraries, then at the distro
[22:12:58] <companion_cube> and your front
[22:13:06] <rhn> they do hold certain standards

[22:13:17] <companion_cube> C's lack of package manager is also why people do single-file, header-only libraries

[22:17:14] <deadk> anyway, the rationale for small stdlib does make some sense, but the specific execution of that idea in rust has an ecosystem with very big dependency trees and you pretty much have to use the latest version of everything
[22:18:16] <deadk> i'm inclined to move slowly and break nothing so that kinda scares me
[22:18:31] <companion_cube> you really don't _have_ to use dependencies
[22:18:37] <companion_cube> you could use C libraries as well
