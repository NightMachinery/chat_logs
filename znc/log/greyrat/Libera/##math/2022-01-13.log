[00:02:59] <isekaijin> Although it's still a little bit sad. In normal math, when someone gives a bunch axioms, he/she takes it as a given that the reader can use his/her prior experience to come up with examples of things that satisfy the axioms, or things that almost satisfy the axioms but fail for subtle reasons. Why can't things work the same way in programming?

[00:34:17] <isekaijin> Well, you think wrong, then.
[00:34:39] <isekaijin> Is the concept of a program specification really that difficult to understand?
[00:34:44] <Batzy> for example: https://i.stack.imgur.com/axggo.jpg
[00:34:55] <isekaijin> In any other branch of engineering, people know what a specification is.
[00:35:06] <Batzy> this checks your boxes. It takes inputs, produces such outputs, and you have some order of operations
[00:35:47] <isekaijin> Okay, not wasting my time more. Sorry, gotta pay attention to the gacha game I'm playing.
[00:35:50] <PJBoy> programming languages are formalised by {operational,denotational,axiomatic} semantics

[00:36:59] <PJBoy> functional languages like F# are particularly clean in the way they apply their semantics
[00:37:02] <Batzy> and i think he wants us to feel bad for not correctly guessing what he's talking about
[00:37:05] <isekaijin> PJBoy: I wasn't talking about language specification or formalization. I was talking about the specification of a single program. Like, someone asks you to write a program for them, the first thing you ask them is “Well, WHAT is the program supposed to do?”, right?
[00:37:27] <PJBoy> right
[00:37:35] <isekaijin> “Oh, I want a program where I can enter XXX data and it gives me YYY answers.”

[00:37:42] <blackfield> Batzy: there's no need to be disrespectful
[00:37:45] <isekaijin> That's a program specification.

[00:37:58] <PJBoy> something like that, yeah
[00:38:12] <Batzy> PJBoy: he also said "order"
[00:38:17] <PJBoy> there's other things like time/space constraints, non-determinism
[00:38:20] <Batzy> which im not sure what that is referring to
[00:38:25] <PJBoy> this kinda stuff is potentially formalised by turing machines
[00:38:44] <Batzy> PJBoy: that's stronger than what he's asking for
[00:39:04] <PJBoy> fair, I just got here
[00:39:42] <isekaijin> Turing machines are more in “formal model of computations”. But, like, who on Earth REALLY cares about computability theory, except perhaps a certain kind of mathematician?
[00:40:09] <PJBoy> computer scientists mostly
[00:40:17] <PJBoy> you need a model of computation to analyse algorithms
[00:40:34] <PJBoy> and lots of compsci researchers tackle lots of algorithms
[00:40:40] <isekaijin> Yeah, well, use the RAM model, perhaps with some extensions to support parallelism, and call it a day.
[00:40:53] <PJBoy> RAM model is commonly used
[00:41:01] <isekaijin> There's no need to complicate your life with abstract nonsense that doesn't even match how actual computers work.
[00:41:02] <Batzy> yeah computability is important, and I think complexity is probably a bigger field at this point
[00:41:05] <PJBoy> and it's an example of a formal model of computation
[00:41:16] <Batzy> PJBoy: but he doesn't want any of that
[00:41:17] <PJBoy> but the RAM model doesn't always apply
[00:41:21] <Batzy> what he wants is even weaker than pseudocode
[00:41:39] <Batzy> there is no "how" question being answered in the specification

[00:43:50] <PlanckWalk> Formal specification is studied, but it's even more abstruse than Turing machines.
[00:43:58] <isekaijin> I've seen very terse, yet precise specifications of complicated geometric objects.
[00:44:08] <isekaijin> Why can't we have the same thing for programs?
[00:44:14] <isekaijin> Even toy ones.
[00:44:26] <PlanckWalk> Programs are much more inherently complicated in general.
[00:44:33] <Batzy> i said that already

[01:11:02] <Guest1778> That is my confusion

[01:12:29] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: you said you work in this area? what do you do specifically?
[01:12:38] <Batzy> or what area do you work in specifically
[01:12:40] <somiaj> are you sure that negative sign there is due to the jacobian and not something else. Because the transform k->-k and k1->-k1 is going to have a positive jacobian since the variables orination with each other stays them same when you negate both of them. If you just negate one of them, it would be negaitve.
[01:14:09] <isekaijin> PlanckWalk: That's super counterintuitive. Is it really that common that a program is simpler than its specification?

[01:20:53] <Guest1778> oh not definitely the - is supposed to be there as it persists throughout the rest of the lectures (I am reviewing)
[01:22:41] <PlanckWalk> Batzy: Oh, just that there are a lot of concepts in mathematics that can be repurposed to describing how we want programs to behave
[01:23:15] <Batzy> When you say that I am thinking of just using mathematicial descriptions of behavior but i think that is the wrong way to think about what you're saying
[01:24:01] <PlanckWalk> I do pretty much just mean that
[01:24:07] <Batzy> mm
[01:24:33] <PlanckWalk> There's a lot of it formalised in things like proof assistants too
[01:24:51] <Batzy> how unique should a specification be? like if you say something in mathematics there's usually a lot of equivalent ways to state it
[01:25:11] <Batzy> and when using it in a program, there's usually 1-2 ways that are better than the others
[01:25:14] <PlanckWalk> I don't think uniqueness is possible
[01:26:16] <Batzy> it's probably not, but being close-to-unique is probably ideal for such a specification
[01:26:23] <PlanckWalk> One goal is to be able to specify the desired behaviour so that (in principle) any program implementation can be checked to see whether it can be proven to meet the specification.
[01:26:37] <PlanckWalk> Checked formally and (again in principle) in an automated manner
[01:26:45] <Batzy> so a proof assistant that doesnt look so horrible
[01:26:46] <Batzy> :)
[01:26:54] <PlanckWalk> Even a horrible one would be nice!
[01:27:11] <Batzy> well we have proof assistants, you just have to completely formalize your thing
[01:27:18] <PlanckWalk> Heh "just"
[01:27:25] <Batzy> yeah, and it's horrible
[01:27:33] <Batzy> my point is i guess we have a horrible way of doing it
[01:27:59] <PlanckWalk> Welll, the problem is that some aspects of specification are just incredibly difficult to make precise
[01:28:16] <PlanckWalk> Since program have real world purposes
[01:28:59] <Guest1778> Thanks for discussing with me anyway somiaj :)
[01:29:09] <PlanckWalk> Even toy problems that are mostly math (like programming contest problems) are often too fuzzy for formal methods.
[01:29:40] <Batzy> what do you think is the biggest benefit to getting something like that done?
[01:29:54] <Batzy> you dont trust humans to verify proofs?
[01:30:09] <PlanckWalk> At the time, I thought that it would end the horrible bug-ridden nightmare we have now.
[01:30:40] <PlanckWalk> That you could write a specification, and *prove* that a program meets it instead of just testing a few isolated fragments.
[01:32:05] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: reminds me of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem
[01:32:16] <Batzy> where to get bounds of the coloring
[01:32:19] <PlanckWalk> Currently, standard practice is (by analogy) testing whether a function implements addition correctly by checking that the result of calling  add(13,24) == 37.
[01:32:25] <Batzy> you figure you can just create increasingly complicated graphs

[01:33:10] <PlanckWalk> If the result is correct, you assume that it implements addition correctly.

[01:33:34] <Batzy> haha yeah
[01:33:49] <PlanckWalk> Then when it breaks for addition involving 0, you add a check for add(0, 193) == 193.
[01:33:55] <Batzy> PlanckWalk: you said "at the time" i think you're still right, just that doing it is too difficult

[01:34:25] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, I still think it's a great idea in principle, and hope someone does it, but it probably won't be me anymore :)
[01:34:54] <Batzy> got better things to do, presumably :P
[01:35:29] <PlanckWalk> Probably not better, but less likely to involve beating my head against a very large wall.
[01:35:37] <PlanckWalk> (Which is the essence of research)
[01:36:41] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes you manage to chip a bit off the wall though.  If you've got a really strong head and a good intuition of the weak points, you can break through.
[01:37:11] <Batzy> you're not in academics/research anymore?
[01:37:21] <PlanckWalk> Right.  Just a boring software dev.
[01:37:27] <Batzy> ah
[01:37:34] <PlanckWalk> (and sometimes other things)
[01:37:53] <Batzy> i am planning on giving research a try, im moving the opposite direction as you presently
[01:38:30] <PlanckWalk> Great!
[01:38:39] <Batzy> we will see
[01:38:54] <Batzy> what you said about banging your head against a wall seems accurate
[01:38:57] <Batzy> it's very discouraging

[03:52:02] *** Joins: horseface_ (~horseface@user/horseface)
[03:53:04] <aindilis> I have forgotten most of my math background. I never understood stats. I assume I could create a probability distribution and compute the entropy of the distribution,
[03:53:05] <aindilis> and maybe compute an MLE and an error margin based on standard deviation
[03:53:38] <Panther> Set it up to begin with so it goes out on the day you choose.
[03:54:09] <aindilis> yeah that makes sense.
[03:54:26] *** Quits: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[03:54:27] <aindilis> this however is an effort to work backwards empirically
[03:54:47] <aindilis> I already have the program which groups withdrawals from an OFX file
[03:54:59] <Panther> Well, I don't let anyone take my money without my permission, empirically or not. :)
[03:55:24] <aindilis> well I'm trying to make it free software that anyone could use, including financially irresponsible people.
[03:56:01] <aindilis> but kudos to you for being on top of your situation :)
[03:56:02] <Panther> Use accrual basis for accounts payable, and cash basis for accounts receivable.
[03:56:11] *** Quits: horseface_ (~horseface@user/horseface) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:56:17] <CloudEvil> There is no mathematical way of doing that.
[03:56:33] <Panther> Of doing what?
[03:56:35] <aindilis> well I assume CloudEvil that maybe bayesian inference or something
[03:56:35] <CloudEvil> It depends on practices and customs of the banking and payments industry that is too variable.
[03:56:52] <aindilis> well the idea is to provide a degree of certainty, not absolute certainty
[03:57:05] <CloudEvil> Ah
[03:57:08] <aindilis> so like I have one payment that always comes out on the 10th
[03:57:14] <aindilis> like 9 times in a row
[03:57:26] <aindilis> whereas others come out within the same 3-day window every month
[03:57:49] <aindilis> I realize that anything set to the day of week is going to be problematic if viewed only in terms of day of month

[03:58:01] <aindilis> I was thinking maybe linear regression?
[03:58:19] <Panther> Still, you know what will come out automatically during the month, so just pay that all out of the account at the beginning of the month, i.e. accrual basis.
[03:58:19] <aindilis> but maybe I could compute a set of features
[03:58:27] <CloudEvil> Do you not have a withdrawer name?
[03:58:37] <aindilis> ah
[03:58:58] <aindilis> well the thing is this is designed to help people struggling financially, who may not have the entire funds for the month up front
[03:59:30] <Panther> Then their account starts in the red.
[03:59:52] <aindilis> well the idea is to be able to say, you will need to raise X by day A, and Y by day B, etc.

[04:01:16] <aindilis> ianae w/ finances
[04:01:22] <Panther> You don't post a receipt until you have the money.
[04:01:29] <aindilis> ah
[04:01:33] <Panther> Whether you anticipate it or not.
[04:01:53] <aindilis> yeah I must be really dumb because I'm not really understanding.  what is "post a receipt"?
[04:02:04] <Panther> However, you post all anticipated debts as soon as you accrue them, whether you have paid them out or not.

[04:07:34] <aindilis> and then consider cyclical date formats like per month, per week, etc. and tag various features, and then compute using some math I no longer remember the conditional probability of a withdrawal occuring each day.
[04:07:35] <aindilis> or something like that. idk.

[04:40:35] <cuppajoeman> I'm familiar with the proof that between any two rational numbers we can find another rational number, I  want to prove it now between any two real numbers though. So far I have x and y in R and then I was trying to use the fact that there exists an n in N, so that 0 < 1/n < y - x, and then trying to use x + 1/n, but I don't think it'll work since x is not necessarily rational, any tips?
[04:41:32] *** Joins: cheater (~Username@user/cheater)
[04:42:26] <PlanckWalk> You can prove that there exists some m such that m/n is in the range
[04:42:57] <PlanckWalk> In particular, there is a least such m
[04:43:42] <PlanckWalk> But you don't really need the least, just that there is one
[04:44:37] <PlanckWalk> The set  { m in Z | m/n > x }  is nonempty and bounded below
[04:45:22] <PlanckWalk> You can use the Archimdean property again for that
[04:45:26] <Decker> what's n for 1,1+ε  ... I guess 1/2ε ?
[04:45:42] <PlanckWalk> There are infinitely many such n

[04:48:49] <cuppajoeman> Hmm your hint makes sense visually we're thinking of the multiples of 1/n (which have length less than y - x, so at least one of the multiples have to end in the middle of x and y ...
[04:48:54] <PlanckWalk> Right
[04:49:05] <cuppajoeman> Would that be by contradiction then?
[04:49:15] <PlanckWalk> No, just Archimdean property directly
[04:49:21] <cuppajoeman> Ok, let me review it
[04:49:42] <cuppajoeman> archimedean_R : ∀ x : ℝ, 0 < x → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ (1/n : ℝ) < x
[04:50:00] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that's one way to state it
[04:50:41] <cuppajoeman> How does that give us a multiple of 1/n though?
[04:50:53] <cuppajoeman> I thought that was just for the initial phase to get our n?
[04:51:02] <PlanckWalk> You use it once to get some n
[04:51:09] <PlanckWalk> Then you can use it again to get an m
[04:51:10] <Decker> power...multiple...
[04:51:16] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I'll think about that
[04:51:24] <Decker> or is that a set notation caret?
[04:52:04] <cuppajoeman> Maybe the characters didn't load for you? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ORTzrqjk/image.png
[04:52:29] <PlanckWalk> I.e. prove that there exists m such that m/n > x, and that the set of such integers m is bounded below and so has a minimum.
[04:52:31] <Decker> it's fine n ∧ (1/n : ℝ)   ... N to-the ... no? :)
[04:52:41] <cuppajoeman> logical and
[04:52:45] <Decker> ahh
[04:53:54] <Decker> I don't think 1/ε is quite right... that's a really big number... ε is already limit of 1/n as n->infinity
[04:55:23] <cuppajoeman> Take m = (x + 1) * n ?
[04:55:33] <PlanckWalk> (x+1)*n isn't an integer
[04:55:38] <PlanckWalk> (In general)
[04:55:43] <cuppajoeman> Oh yah because x in R
[04:55:52] <cuppajoeman> Ok, we seal it
[04:56:20] <cuppajoeman> Take m = ceil(x) * n
[04:56:34] <PlanckWalk> Have you proved that such a function exists?
[04:57:04] <PlanckWalk> Usually the proof of that uses the Archimedean property and well-ordering of bounded below sets of integers.
[04:57:11] <cuppajoeman> I am allowed to use `has_ceiling : ∀ x : ℝ,  ∃ m : ℤ, ((m-1) : ℝ) ≤ x ∧ x < (m:ℝ)` as a lemma here
[04:57:13] <PlanckWalk> So if you've already done that then sure, that works.
[04:57:41] <PlanckWalk> Ah good, that makes it nearly trivial :)
[04:57:57] <PlanckWalk> ceil(x n)  works better though
[04:58:08] <PlanckWalk> Then you can use that directly in the proof
[04:58:27] <PlanckWalk> (And no need to find a minimum of the given set, since it *is* the minimum)
[04:59:36] <cuppajoeman> So I need to prove that x < ceil(x * n) / m < y right?

[05:17:21] <PlanckWalk> cuppajoeman: n=1 doesn't satisfy 0 < 1/n < 2.9 - 2.8
[05:17:34] <PlanckWalk> You need n >= 11
[05:19:03] <PlanckWalk> So with n=11 you get  m = ceil(11*2.8) = 31, though really x should be irrational for this.
[05:19:26] <PlanckWalk> Yuo can make it work for rational x as well if you use  floor(nx)+1

[07:17:17] <somiaj> Well I don't agree with your jacobian, it should be [ [-1,0]; [0,-1] ], but that still has a determinant of 1
[07:17:32] <somiaj> since the partial derivatives will be -1 (not 1)
[07:18:29] <somiaj> But note that problem now that i look at it again, k => -k, and k1 => -k1, but you are integrating only in the k1 and k2 plane
[07:19:03] <somiaj> so the change of variables there is k1 => -k1 and k2 => k2, and that will have a -1 for the determinant of the jacobian, since one of the partials is negative and one of them is positive
[07:19:36] <somiaj> i.e. in that case your jacobian is [ [-1,0]; [0,1] ], k1-top, k2-bottom, and that indeed has a -1 determinant

[07:21:46] <Guest1778> Okay
[07:21:52] <somiaj> you have two functions, one that says how k1 transforms, and one that says how k2 transforms

[07:22:45] <somiaj> But i was confused eariler cause I didn't quite catch the three variables and your transformation you were really integrating over is k1 => -k1 and k2 => k2

[07:38:12] <Guest1778> I meant, do we include that into the jacobian

[07:40:18] <Guest1778> I'm guessing we do because that yields -k^3 / k~^3, which matches what the prof got.
[07:40:18] <Guest1778> Though, I am still confused on what the rule is for what variables to consider in the jacobian
[07:41:15] <Guest1778> ?but this sort of negates what we just spoke about

[07:48:51] <johnkeats6>  Guest1778 thats just a notational trick for computing the cross product

[07:49:18] <johnkeats6> usually people write i j k in the last row
[07:50:48] <Guest1778> I don't follow. Are you discussing my issue of what variables to consider in the determinant of the jacobian ?
[07:51:31] <johnkeats6> i'm too lazy to read all you wrote, but i'm confident the answer is that this is a cross product

[10:04:01] <Ethos> I am a bit confused about series notation. Lets say I have the sequence {x_n} = {1+x+x^2+...+x^n}, and I am asked to prove the convergence.
[10:05:09] <isekaijin> What do you mean by “prove the convegence”?
[10:05:19] <isekaijin> Whether that sequence convergence depends on the value of “x” to begin with.
[10:05:34] <yashi> Ethos: how is that a sequence?
[10:05:39] <yashi> Ethos: that notation means nothing
[10:05:42] <yashi> it is a sham
[10:05:56] <Ethos> Nah, lets say I am asked to prove that the sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^n converges
[10:05:56] <isekaijin> Clearly, he means (x_n)_{n \in N}.
[10:06:08] <isekaijin> Ethos: That depends on the value of x.
[10:06:10] <Ethos> Yeah that notation was unfortunate
[10:06:13] <Ethos> Yeah wait wait
[10:06:25] <isekaijin> Also, you meant your sum to start from n = 0.
[10:06:33] <Ethos> Clearly we should have |x| < 1, but i don't care about that details
[10:06:44] <Ethos> My question is about notation, not if that series converges or not
[10:07:13] <isekaijin> It suffices to show that the sequence is Cauchy for |x| < 1.
[10:07:18] <Ethos> -.-
[10:07:19] <isekaijin> Errr, the sequence of partial sums.
[10:07:44] <isekaijin> Now, by the triangle inequality |1 + x + ... + x^n| <= 1 + |x| + ... + |x|^n.
[10:08:12] <Ethos> I know how to prove the convergence
[10:08:16] <isekaijin> Then?
[10:08:41] <isekaijin> Oh, you said “the question is about notation”.
[10:08:45] <Ethos> twice :P
[10:08:55] <isekaijin> Then I would say that x_n is a horrible name for the sequence of partial sums.
[10:08:57] <Ethos> Let me use tex better
[10:12:39] <Ethos> http://mathb.in/69489
[10:13:07] <Ethos> Then lim{S_n} = 1/(1-x)
[10:15:04] <Ethos> But is that the same than asking, for x in ]-1,1[ prove the sequence {1+x+x^2+...+x^n} converges to 1/(1-x)?
[10:16:04] <Ethos> For the first question, I would proceed as I stated in the tex link, but for the second one, I would use epsilon-limit definition
[10:16:38] <isekaijin> For both questions, I would use the calculation in the mathb.in post.
[10:17:54] <Ethos> The questions are the same, aren't they?
[10:18:18] <Ethos> in the first one i am asked, implicitely, to compute lim{S_n}
[10:18:46] <Ethos> If that's the case then i am fine, if not that notation confuses me a lot
[10:19:08] *** Joins: zalt (~zalt@user/zalt)
[10:19:33] <isekaijin> Strictly speaking, to show that the series converges, you don't really need to compute its limit.
[10:20:02] <isekaijin> But in this case, computing the limit is so easy that looking for another way to merely show that the series converges seems contrived and roundabout.
[10:20:28] <Ethos> With your first sentence, you mean we should use criterias  for convergence?
[10:20:59] <isekaijin> If you're asked to show that the series converges, you can use whatever method you wish.
[10:21:04] <isekaijin> Computing the limit is one way.
[10:21:13] <Ethos> Ah I see what you meant
[10:21:15] <isekaijin> Using Cauchy's ratio test is another way.
[10:21:53] <Ethos> Well, since this question is asked before methods are introduced I guess limit or epsilon-limit definition are the ways
[10:22:10] <isekaijin> Sure.
[10:22:20] <Ethos> Thanks.

[14:53:59] <adder> hello, I'm looking for an algebra book suitable for self study that must cover all this https://dpaste.com/B5ZMXSGDJ I have a book but it's very terse and full of mathematical rigor and I'm not a mathematician, I'm a programmer
[14:54:35] <riv> MacLand and Birkoff - Algebra  covers this
[14:54:39] <riv> MacLane*
[14:55:27] <riv> Dummit and Foote is another option
[14:55:47] <kamil> Dummit may be overkill
[14:56:56] <riv> yeah there's a lot you can skip
[15:04:25] <kamil> maybe some Schaums books ? Discrete Mathematics
[15:05:28] <kamil> thogh it lacks in complex numbers and Linear Algebra
[15:06:42] <Vornicus> ugh I'm still stuck on this thing.  I'm working my way through a discrete differential geometry course and have gotten stuck on a particular exercise: "Show that when we take the gradient of the total surface area with respect to the position of one of the vertices, we get \nabla_{f_i}\sum_{ijk\in F}A_{ijk}=1/2 \sum_{ij\in E}(\cot\alpha_{ij}+\cot\beta_{ij})(f_i-f_j), where \alpha_{ij} and \beta_{ij} are the
[15:06:42] <Vornicus> two interior angles opposite edge ij."
[15:08:35] <Vornicus> Which is to say: the gradient of the surface area wrt one vertex is each edge attached to that edge, times the sum of the cotangents of the angles opposite that edge in the triangles that edge is on
[15:08:41] <Vornicus> all added up

[15:15:32] <Vornicus> my first guess has been to break the triangles down into right triangles and that ...sort of works a little bit, but not well enough: given an edge, I break down the two adjacent triangles into right triangles by dropping altitudes from the objective vertex; then the two right triangles *far* from the edge get their bottom edges to be h * cot(alpha) and h * cot(beta) respectively
[15:15:33] <twJizhan> Z-module: want to chat with you on ##math-offtopic
[15:18:50] <Vornicus> those don't change as h does so the gradient is just 1/2 h_alpha * cot(alpha)
[15:19:55] <Vornicus> but you'll notice that this uses those altitudes instead of the actual edge direction, which is what I'd like

[15:24:35] <rsonx> suppose 4 people trow their hats in a pile and then each of them picks a hat randomly, then what is the probability that only one of them gets their original hat back. According to me it must be (1/4*2/3*1/2)*(4C1)

[15:30:12] <Vornicus> Careful
[15:32:28] <Vornicus> there's something gone terribly wrong in your logic if that's your thought, in particular for three hats

[17:06:40] <johnkeats6> linearity of expectation is one of those things where the proof is trivial but the result is still nearly unbelievable
[17:06:43] <Ethos> Does it make sense the notation lim n->inf {x_n}? I've seen lim {x_n} and lim n-> inf x_n but not that one
[17:08:18] <Vornicus> that doesn't look like a sensible notation no

[17:11:37] <johnkeats6> yes it's not surprising if you're a formal theorem prover
[17:11:55] <johnkeats6> but still some of us are human beings :>
[17:13:08] <isekaijin> Expectation is a badly chosen mathematical name (as usual!) for what's really an average over a large number of retrials, or so frequentists say.
[17:14:41] <isekaijin> The idea that an arbitrary experiment can be redone an arbitrarily large number of times is itself kinda sus too.
[17:15:54] *** Joins: soapsudsxx (~soapsudsx@141.193.188.140)
[17:16:16] <isekaijin> Anyhow, no need to bring retrials into the discussion, expectation is really a weighted average if you look at the purely mathematical definition. The baffling thing is that anyone thought “expectation” would be a good name for this.
[17:17:43] <cherim> I saw very strong people have (intuitive) doubts in clear cases of linearity of expectation
[17:17:46] <johnkeats6> i don't see the distinction you're trying to make
[17:18:02] <johnkeats6> what other definition of expectation would you give?
[17:18:21] <isekaijin> I'm not proposing to change the definition, I'm proposing to change the name.
[17:18:33] <isekaijin> To “average” or something like that.
[17:18:56] <johnkeats6> if i wanted to make a bet with you on what you expect from the outcome of X experiment would you not calculate the expected value?
[17:19:10] <cherim> If you have a strongly correlated system and observables h(x1) and h(x2) at two close points, then knowing single point statistics <h(x)> is not enough to find <h(x1) h(x2)>
[17:19:21] <cherim> But it is sufficient for <h(x1) + h(x2)>
[17:19:38] <isekaijin> johnkeats6: The average of the possible outcomes, weighted by probability, is certainly a useful quantity.
[17:19:52] <isekaijin> What I don't know is why this weighted average would be called an “expectation”.
[17:20:07] <cherim> This appeals to some specific property of addition which is not related to neglecting correlations
[17:20:10] <johnkeats6> because it's the best you can say you expect will happen
[17:20:45] <johnkeats6> maybe if you're a diehard frequentist the objection makes sense, idk

[17:34:21] <isekaijin> The objection isn't to the concept of expectation, but rather to the name.
[17:34:45] <isekaijin> If I expect that A will happen, and I can deduce from A that B will happen, then I should expect that B will happen.
[17:34:49] <johnkeats6> the outcome is what it is regardless of how much you like it

[19:02:36] <savask> Anyway, you can replace your circle by a polygon with straight sides. It's perimeter length won't be exactly the circumference, but very close to it
[19:02:37] *** Joins: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.lymington.irccloud.com)
[19:03:24] <savask> And that scaling property works for polygons, since they have straight sides
[19:04:31] <stanrifkin> i get your point, but you understand my reservation or?
[19:04:45] <savask> Not really
[19:05:07] <stanrifkin> in case of diameter *and* circumference you've 2 lines
[19:05:15] <stanrifkin> both can *scale*
[19:05:29] <stanrifkin> but how do you know the diameter still *fits*
[19:06:08] <savask> I don't think I understand the problem still
[19:06:29] <savask> You make the circle two times bigger, everything obviously still fits
[19:07:28] <stanrifkin> the assumption that's like a polygon...
[19:07:35] <stanrifkin> say you've got an square
[19:07:43] <stanrifkin> and the diameter of the square
[19:08:04] <stanrifkin> scale every side of the square with 2 and the diameter with 2
[19:08:09] <stanrifkin> than it works out
[19:08:17] <savask> It does work out indeed
[19:08:34] <stanrifkin> but the assumption that it works with curves lines also so to say...
[19:09:13] <savask> There's a somewhat complex but honest answer to your question
[19:09:22] <savask> The key issue is "what is length?"
[19:09:38] <stanrifkin> 3 times the diameter say the bible :)
[19:09:52] <savask> That's for the circle, but what about other curves
[19:10:00] <stanrifkin> hm...
[19:10:09] <stanrifkin> quite hard i think
[19:10:14] <savask> It is indeed
[19:10:47] <savask> For a straight line segment it's doable, you just compare your segment with some other "standard" segment of length, say, 1 meter or 1 foot or whatever
[19:11:57] <savask> For arbitrary curves you have to replace them by line segments
[19:12:14] <savask> Here's a good picture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length#/media/File:Arclength.svg
[19:12:57] <savask> If your curve is good enough you can always do it and define length as a "limit"
[19:13:49] <stanrifkin> ok
[19:13:49] <savask> In particular it is possible to prove the scaling property that way, in terms of line segments

[19:38:38] <somiaj> Guest1778: I think you are going from 3D to 3D space, so your transformation has three functions k = f1(k,k1,k2), k1 = f2(k,k1,k2), and k2 = f3(k,k1,k2), so do all the partial derivative combinations giving you a 3x3 Jacobian

[20:39:13] <riv> yes
[20:39:21] <riv> you may only perform a disjoint union when the sets are disjoint
[20:40:37] <CalimeroTeknik> is there anything in mathematics that might correspond to discriminated unions?
[20:41:27] <johnkeats6> that's not how you take a disjoint union
[20:41:53] <johnkeats6> usually defined as 1 x A u 2 x B
[20:42:10] <johnkeats6> in programmers lingo each element has a flag indicating which set it came from
[20:42:29] <CalimeroTeknik> oh! so that's how it's done
[20:43:21] <CalimeroTeknik> or rather the result is a set of couples that tell the original set and the item
[20:43:41] <johnkeats6> yes
[20:44:00] <johnkeats6> though people say pair or tuple instead of couple
[20:44:11] <CalimeroTeknik> since a set is defined only by what it contains, this finally works for me!
[20:44:38] <CalimeroTeknik> oh yes pair; couple was a gallicism

[21:20:09] <somiaj> Guest1778: You were looking at only the transform of k1->-k1 and k2->k2, which is all that was needed for the double integral.
