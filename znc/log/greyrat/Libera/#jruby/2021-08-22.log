[00:22:13] <headius> Ok that's bizarre
[00:23:27] <headius> fzakaria yeah if the other mechanisms are reliable then this is fine. We started out with it hardcoded and people added the right search logic later

[03:49:35] <fzakaria[m]> Yea just hardcoding never seems correct
[03:49:41] <fzakaria[m]> and its already accepting the system property paths.
[05:10:45] <headius> Is it reasonable to have as a fallback?
[05:11:09] <headius> I don't care if we ditch it, just trying to think of any possible situation where it would be needed
[05:11:20] <headius> enebo maybe you have some thoughts here too

[22:08:44] <fzakaria[m]> Hmm; just seems like if they are needed, they can be set on the system property.
[22:08:44] <fzakaria[m]> Those system properties are hydrated originally with sensible defaults for each platform by the JDK.
[22:09:06] <fzakaria[m]> (I know this is a very nuanced annoying discussion.... it's part of the pain of trying to have hermeticity with Nix)
