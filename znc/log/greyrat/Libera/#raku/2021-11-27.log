[19:05:40] <SmokeMachine> Hi! Could someone help me? Could someone try to run the tests for https://github.com/FCO/Test-Describe? it's breaking on GitHub actions, but works on my machine...
[19:06:30] <lizmat> is the problem that you cannot actually see the errors?  backtraces ?
[19:08:41] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: the tests are just not passing: https://github.com/FCO/Test-Describe/runs/4341569375?check_suite_focus=true but I can't reproduce it on my machine... I'd like to know if someone can reproduce it to let me know if that's my machine's problem or GitHub action's problem

[21:05:44] <Skarsnik> Yes, I guess. I kinda expected Raku to run each Junction value to the op

[23:03:28] <Skarsnik> Noo, I got random segfault now >< Can I do some raku without having weird issue? xD
[23:12:30] <nine> Skarsnik: is it somewhat reproducible?
[23:13:43] <Skarsnik> It's not consistent, so maybe not? Is there a command to run to have a bt?
[23:14:05] <Skarsnik> I mean outside running in gdb, I doubt this will be very helpful
[23:14:54] <Ergo444> hi all
[23:15:02] <nine> Well gdb does make these things a lot easier. But rr is even better
[23:15:24] <Ergo444> is the Javascript and jvm backend working?
[23:15:56] <Skarsnik> I was expecting more like an argument you gave to raku x)
[23:16:33] <nine> Skarsnik: does rakudo-gdb-m count? :D
[23:16:43] <nine> Ergo444: jvm somewhat. Don't know about js
[23:17:00] <Skarsnik> I happen since I added some code that delete stuff in both an array and hash while they are iterated over
[23:17:10] <Ergo444> are there many commercial users?
[23:18:51] <Skarsnik> (gdb) bt
[23:18:51] <Skarsnik> #0  0x00007fffff19ac28 in MVM_gc_mark_collectable () from /usr/lib/moar/libmoar.so
[23:18:54] <nine> Ergo444: several are listed on raku.org
[23:19:06] <Skarsnik> Not really useful, I think there was a command to have the "raku" code?
[23:19:53] <nine> Skarsnik: if it segfaults there, it needs a closer look at VM level. Raku level backtrace won't help
[23:20:19] <nine> Best course of action is to give instructions on how to reproduce this segfault
[23:20:49] <Ergo444> I wonder how fast raku now.
[23:21:13] <Skarsnik> But I think I remember you could know what instruction was running?
[23:21:54] <Skarsnik> nine, well it's a 'big' project (GPTrixie)
[23:21:57] <nine> Ergo444: faster than it used to be. Whether it's fast enough depends on your use case. In essence, you'll just have to trie it.
[23:22:45] <Skarsnik> For me it's still too slow compared to other language, but depending on what you are doing it's probably not a big deal
[23:23:16] <nine> Skarsnik: as long as all components are easily installable, that shouldn't be an issue. You can get a Raku backtrace in gdb with: call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)
[23:23:32] <nine> You're gonna need to compile MoarVM with debug info though
[23:24:15] <Ergo444> I tried it three years ago
[23:24:24] <Ergo444> I still use Perl 5 mostly
[23:26:56] <Ergo444> I must admit the language is very smooth
[23:27:13] <Skarsnik> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --moar-option='--optimize=0 --debug=3'--gen-nqp --backends=moar is enought nine ?
[23:27:56] <lizmat> I don't think the --gen-nqp and --backends=moar are needed in that case
[23:29:40] <timo> it'd be enough to change moarvm's configure options and "make install" only moarvm
[23:29:48] <Skarsnik> let's try ^^
[23:30:30] <Skarsnik> I don't want to spend too much stuff on that thou. I just wanted to fix GPTrixie to work better with castxml, I have a more interesting project to do after x)
[23:33:46] <Skarsnik> Also not sure if that can be improved but compiling is still kinda slow (could be because of wsl too if there is too much IO)
[23:34:24] <Skarsnik> Compile time of Raku module, not the whole moar/nqp/rakudo
