[00:24:24] <mdogg> I'm glad twb brought up American Sign Language as an example where language is part of a proper noun.  
[00:25:58] <raccoon_dog> I was going to mention (before he branded me, multiple times, a "bureaucrat") that when people say "the Hudson" instead of using the full name of the river ("Hudson River"), that it's perhaps an example of a figure of speech (maybe synecdoche?).
[00:26:23] <raccoon_dog> But I honestly lost all interest when they showed that their objective was to argue, belittle and try to claim the higher moral ground.

[03:43:53] <mdogg> Or you could write, "I saw Sammy Davis Junior."
[03:46:03] <mdogg> But I think "I saw Sammy Davis Jr." looks better, actually.  You would not include another period after Jr.
[03:53:17] <Losher> mdogg: So what grammatical term would you use to denote the ".." if you write it as "I heard Sammy Davis Jr.."
[03:54:33] <mdogg> If something has three dots, it's called an ellipsis.  For example, "I went to the dinner show in 1957 and I wasn't having that great of a time... then Sammy Davis Jr. took the stage and everything changed."
[03:54:49] <mdogg> Is that what you mean?  
[03:56:42] <mdogg> Actually, that's not the greatest example of how an ellipsis is used.  
[03:56:59] <mdogg> Here's a good example.  "When in Rome...."
[03:57:35] <LuisM18> do as what you're told
[03:57:38] <mdogg> The ellipsis denotes that the reader can likely fill in the rest of the sentence themselves.  
[03:57:46] * LuisM18 chuckles
[03:58:51] <mdogg> The actual expression is, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

[03:59:08] <LuisM18> :)
[04:00:12] <mdogg> Is that what you're asking Losher?  As I re-read your question I think I may have misunderstood what you were asking.
[04:01:26] <TimMc> Losher: I've never heard a name for it.
[04:02:12] <raccoon_dog> So, two things.
[04:02:45] <raccoon_dog> First of all, according to some style guides, no, the period at the end of the abbreviation serves a double purpose: to indicate the abbreviation, and to end the sentence.
[04:02:58] <raccoon_dog> Second: I'm not aware of ".." having a specific name.
[04:03:09] <raccoon_dog> https://style.mla.org/abbreviation-period-end-sentence/
[04:03:42] <Losher> mdogg: my OED doesn't require dots to call something an ellipsis, nor is 3 a magic number requirement it seems. OED just says it signifies missing words, and implies that ellipsis ism
[04:04:21] <raccoon_dog> Losher: I always thought ellipses had to be three dots, spaced or together.
[04:04:47] <Losher> isnt the 3 little dots. The ellipsis is the text that has gone missing, as I understand it
[04:05:05] <raccoon_dog> It can mean both.
[04:05:16] <raccoon_dog> The three dots themselves OR the elided content.
[04:05:31] <Losher> raccoon_dog: I agree
[04:05:55] * raccoon_dog nods.
[04:09:15] <mdogg> Nice source raccoon_dog

[04:13:49] <mdogg> Last time I tried giving something to somebody I gave them the wrong "whatever it's called"

[22:24:48] <j0hn> Voxel: for what "does" placed at first of sentence?
[22:25:31] <kompowiec> as i can see, in Poland, we have about 37 million people and 11 million were vaccinated.
[22:26:12] <Voxel> j0hn, When a verb appears at the start of a sentence, generally it assumes a question.
[22:26:24] <j0hn> kompowiec: yes i know... but my mean is "your professors can create vaccine"?
[22:27:01] <j0hn> Voxel: yes i know this... for what "is" not placed in sentence?
[22:27:03] <Voxel> For example, it differs from "Poland does have a vaccine." which might mean a conclusion.
[22:27:13] <kompowiec> good question, Due to the wave of disinformation, I stopped being interested in the topic because I did not want to check every single piece of information.
[22:27:50] <Voxel> j0hn I don't really know why would "is" even appear there.
[22:28:07] <kompowiec> I don't know what the general tendency is, but I went through covid for a few months, for example, before the panic over it broke out. So far I am healthy and I am not sick.
[22:28:23] <Voxel> This might probably work, though: "Is Poland a country which has a vaccine?"
[22:28:39] <j0hn> Voxel: ok thanks... i undrastand  :)

[22:29:15] <kurahaupo> wtf did someone add that second entry to "compatibility", when it's already covered by the first meaning? Typical Wiktionary. Grrr.
[22:29:21] <kompowiec> I am not sure if we has his own vaccine, although I have seen at least one article from a Pole who was supposed to criticize foreign vaccines.
[22:29:27] <Voxel> Oh dear... So, I Googled "What is is" and it showed some kind of NSFW content...
[22:30:02] <kompowiec> afaik we use pfizer or astraZeneca
[22:30:03] <Voxel> j0hn related: https://writingexplained.org/is-is-a-verb
[22:30:19] <kompowiec> but I haven't checked this information for a long time, it may be out of date
[22:30:24] <j0hn> kompowiec: thanks for your information :)
[22:30:56] <kompowiec> and I literally puke about this topic.
[22:31:08] <j0hn> Voxel: i was seeing this
[22:31:32] <Voxel> I saw this*
[22:32:20] *** Joins: Tobbi (~Tobbi@2a02:8108:1240:48ec:e012:770a:44db:6a68)
[22:32:24] <j0hn> Voxel: yes D:
[22:33:17] <Voxel> "I was seeing this" generally assumes more information like "I couldn't even imagine what I was seeing out of this window until I asked my colleague".
[22:34:26] <j0hn> :)
[22:34:53] <kurahaupo> j0hn: “for what "does" placed at first of sentence?” → “Why is "does" placed at the start of a sentence?” (answer: for the same reason that the words in your sentence needed to be rearranged: because it's a question (and the "w…" word isn't the subject of the sentence)

[22:36:59] <Voxel> 'Why "is" does' sounded like German :D
[22:37:18] <kurahaupo> It is quite common for people whose native language is strongly inflected to miss that word order is critically important in English, and that it's 4 different ways for commands, statements, titles, and questions.
[22:37:41] <Voxel> "Was ist das?"
[22:39:08] <kompowiec> i can confirm. You have to think in English so as not to make such mistakes.
[22:40:02] <kompowiec> eg. to today i don't know when i should use "that"
[22:40:13] <kompowiec> and when not
[22:40:20] <kurahaupo> Recently English has adopted a novel structure for questions: in many dialects one can now start a question with "How to …" when that was not previously valid; it was a relative clause with an elided "Please tell me how to"
[22:40:41] <j0hn> who made this robot? tinsoldier my mean

[22:42:10] <kurahaupo> Who isn't99,99 a programmer here?
[22:42:19] <j0hn> oh
[22:42:26] <kompowiec> interesting. Sounds like a bit my conjunction in my native language - we have a special starting word that allows you to create a question from any sentence.
[22:42:34] <j0hn> kurahaupo: i am a simple programmer
[22:42:48] <kompowiec> python? bash? 
[22:43:01] <j0hn> python, C++, C, Dart
[22:43:04] <kurahaupo> Perl, I think
[22:43:19] <j0hn> and few php

[22:43:32] <kompowiec> perl, huh, it was long time ago
[22:43:44] <kurahaupo> I'm still writing Perl
[22:43:53] <kompowiec> only old-date administrators remember perl.
[22:44:03] <j0hn> can you create a simple bot in IRC protocol?

[22:44:19] <tinsoldier> Not found
[22:44:25] <kompowiec> i don't mind perl but it hurts to read it sometimes.
[22:44:33] <kurahaupo> .w old-timer
[22:44:36] <tinsoldier> old-timer — Noun: 1. One who has been around for a long time or has a great deal of experience; a veteran. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/old-timer
[22:45:16] <kompowiec> old-timer, makes sense, strange i didn't know before.
[22:45:55] <j0hn> kompowiec: for what it is hurts to read it sometimes? all programming languages is easy
[22:46:41] <kompowiec> https://pastebin.com/wdSTXYaa
[22:46:55] <kompowiec> look at this mess
[22:46:57] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: Before I did programming I did mathematics, where I got used to knowing and dealing with latin letters, Greek letters, hebrew letters, digits, and many dozen special symbols. So I can't see what all the fuss  is about having $ and @ in Perl
[22:47:38] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: You can write obfuscated code in any language
[22:47:48] <kompowiec> even in python? :P
[22:48:09] <kompowiec> tbh i tried and i not found
[22:48:35] <kurahaupo> (To write obfuscated code in Java, you go the opposite direction: make all the names enormously long, rather than very short)
[22:49:21] <kompowiec> well, I don't know mathematical constructions but programming is easier for me to understand.
[22:51:56] <kompowiec> however, I have to admit that my first serious experience with programming was thanks to vim, which uses .. perl-like instructins.
[22:52:25] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: A cursory inspection of that perl code indicates a lot of the type of operations I would expect to see in a cryptographic library, so I expect the point is exactly to obscure itself and whatever it's protecting. Some basic line unfolding and indenting would make it much much easier to read
[22:54:58] <kompowiec> that's why I'm glad there is something like python. I tried to find of his faults, I did not find.
[22:55:28] <kompowiec> I don't count dynamic typing which makes it slower than java.
[22:55:57] <kompowiec> in interpreted languages, performance is secondary.
