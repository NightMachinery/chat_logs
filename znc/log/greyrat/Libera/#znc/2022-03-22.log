[18:25:30] <DarthGandalf> darwin: what happens to znc.pem? do you have some automation which destroys it from cron?
[18:25:44] <DarthGandalf> Jaxx: that depends on your client

[18:26:59] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/weechat

[18:31:54] <Lartza> What is not that
[18:31:59] <Jaxx> For me I use a command that has zncuser/zncnetwork:password in the command,but idk if people who use weechat can do the same

[18:34:57] <Jaxx> its just a question in general what the whole command is to use where it has "zncuser/zncnetwork:password" part of the command
[18:35:17] <Lartza> What's wrong with the wiki example?
[18:35:21] <Jaxx> I think it has something to do with /starting with /znc .. but thats all i know
[18:36:19] <Jaxx> or maybe there's another command and not starting with /znc .. just a guess
[18:36:31] <Lartza> Again, the wiki shows you an example command "/server add BNC my.bouncer.net/6667 -username=username/network -password=password -autoconnect"
[18:36:33] <Lartza> What's wrong with that
[18:37:16] <Jaxx> no no no. im not talking about that :s
[18:37:43] <Lartza> Then we don't really know what you are talking about, that is how you connet to ZNC
[18:37:45] <Lartza> from weechat
[18:37:56] <Jaxx> i know there is a command that has something to do with "zncuser/zncnetwork:password" iin the part of the command. I just dont remember what the whole command was
[18:38:04] <Lartza> Yes
[18:38:10] <Lartza> THAT command
[18:38:18] <Lartza> -username=zncuser/zncnetwork -password=password
[18:39:06] <Jaxx> thats a total different commend than what I used.. but i dont use weebchat. im trying to find out what command that I used
[18:39:15] <Jaxx> *weechat
[18:39:16] <Lartza> Why do you need that command?
[18:39:33] <Jaxx> because i asked for it,duh
