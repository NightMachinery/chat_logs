[00:49:59] <PMT> you could also try debugging why the GUI isn't launching right now, but the solution to that will probably be to finish at least part of the upgrade anyway
[00:50:38] <urk> Thats beyond my experience or skill level.  However I did a full backup with time machine, and rsync.
[00:51:30] <PMT> you can ask for help with problems as they arise, but just rolling back to the old system will likely result in a similar problem when you try upgrading again.

[02:34:32] * gordonfish reads
[02:34:41] <n4dir> in short: it has  a little change. This channels bot has an entry, but i forgot how to "call" it
[02:35:02] <gordonfish> bullseye-security instead of codename/updates
[02:35:05] <sney> dpkg: bullseye/updates
[02:35:05] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.
[02:35:20] <n4dir> good there is always a master around :-) thanks

[02:36:06] <PMT> I believe bullseye sources.list, sources.list, and bullseye-security all have similar entries.
[02:36:19] <gordonfish> Curious, that site says to use deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security rather than deb https://security.debian.org/debian-security
[02:36:39] <gordonfish> Is security.debian.org being phased out?
[02:36:42] <sney> they currently serve the same thing, but I think security.d.o is eventually going away 
[02:37:01] <gordonfish> Ok I'll update according to that page

[02:38:35] <greycat> deb.debian.org/debian-security and security.debian.org/debian-security both work
[02:39:11] <greycat> I think security.d.o maps to a much smaller set of servers, which creates a bottleneck.
[02:39:44] <greycat> (and then there's that person who goes around putting https:// on the wiki for no reason at all)
[02:40:08] <PMT> I am not that person, but I can't really object to suggesting people might want to use https where possible.
[02:40:16] <greycat> I can.
[02:40:26] <PMT> For which reason?
[02:40:43] <greycat> Extra burden on the mirrors for no real benefit.
[02:41:15] <gordonfish> greycat: Are you saying https shouldn't be used in sources.list files?
[02:41:28] <greycat> It shouldn't be advocated as a default to newbies.
[02:41:51] <greycat> People who *need* it (because their workplaces have idiotic HTTP proxies) are an exception, and they know who they are.

[02:42:28] <gordonfish> Come ot think of it, everything in /etc/apt/sources.list on every debian machine I have access to (including my own) has http, not https
[02:42:32] <PMT> So the mirrors can just...not run HTTPS if they don't want to deal with the load increase, and I would presume that whatever redirector runs deb.debian.org is clever enough to not break on that?
[02:42:59] *** Quits: phunyguy (~blaahchm@ubuntu/member/phunyguy) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:43:57] <greycat> !deb.debian.org
[02:43:57] <dpkg> deb.debian.org is a mirror network that is backed by international content delivery networks and for most users, this is the most reliable <mirror> to use in the <sources.list>. From Debian 9 "Stretch" onwards, apt queries SRV records in DNS which then send it off to a CDN. Older apt will get an HTTP redirect from deb.debian.org to the same CDNs. See http://deb.debian.org/ for more details.
[02:44:29] <PMT> Yes, and?
[02:44:56] <gordonfish> Damnit, digital ocean: Err:6 http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/debian bullseye-security Release 404
[02:44:56] <sney> it's a cdn, separate from the distinct mirrors
[02:44:57] <gordonfish> looks like they are still using 'bullseye-updates'
[02:45:08] <sney> gordonfish: that's the other one 
[02:45:22] <sney> security is the former bullseye/updates, with a /
[02:45:40] <sney> (it was easy to mix them up, hence the change) 
[02:46:46] *** Quits: not_phunyguy (~blaahchm@ubuntu/member/phunyguy) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:46:53] <gordonfish> err, actually DO uses 'bullseye-updates'
[02:47:16] <sney> bullseye-updates still exists, it is bugfix updates in between point releases
[02:47:24] <PMT> Okay, I had assumed it was a CDN that was ultimately backed by a mirror rotation, not entirely orthogonal. Either way, then, is the argument then "the poor CDN can't handle HTTPS", "we shouldn't advocate that individual mirrors have to support https even when we're telling people not to default to specific mirrors", or ?
[02:47:29] <sney> bullseye/updates, with a /, is now bullseye-security. 
[02:47:33] <greycat> it's debian-security bullseye-security
[02:48:15] <joepublic> The "poor CDN" can handle https for those who need it, but arguably shouldn't have to for those who don't.

[02:50:04] <PMT> I'm not asking "why isn't it necessary", I'm asking "why is it explicitly a bad idea rather than neutral"
[02:50:19] <sney> apt having https in documentation is a side effect of the push to use https everywhere, for everything. and it's not strictly necessary and might add some minor overhead, though mainly on infrastructure that is engineered to handle lots of https requests 24/7. idk, I don't think it's worth fighting about 
[02:50:22] <greycat> Well, there used to be a web page that explained it all.
[02:50:27] <gordonfish> ug, ok this is what DO uses still:
[02:50:28] <gordonfish> deb http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/debian buster-updates main contrib non-free
[02:50:43] <gordonfish> Nothing else seems to work from them
[02:50:43] <sney> gordonfish: buster-updates is irrelevant for your bullseye system
[02:50:51] <sney> gordonfish: try using a different mirror. 
[02:51:03] <gordonfish> oops, wrog copy paste, mine has s/buster/bullseye/g
[02:51:03] <sney> (DO will eventually get their rears in gear, probably)
[02:51:03] <greycat> gordonfish: Again.  It's debian-security bullseye-security.   Not debian bullseye-security.
[02:51:17] <sney> !bullseye sources.list
[02:51:17] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[02:51:25] <sney> gordonfish: ^ see all 3 entries 
[02:51:27] <gordonfish> greycat: Yes I tried that
[02:51:35] <gordonfish> sney: Will do, thanks
[02:51:42] <sney> there is debian-security bullseye-security, AND debian bullseye-updates 
[02:51:57] <gordonfish> I have the general debian lines working already, it's just the DO ones
[02:52:09] <sney> ...
[02:52:16] <sney> those DO entries are just a regular debian mirror
[02:52:21] <sney> they don't host anything special

[02:53:44] <sney> that one looks right, at least
[02:54:33] <gordonfish> I already had the deb.debian.org lines in place and working according to apt update, just working out the DO specific lines on a droplet
[02:54:50] <PMT> you don't need them, is what people are telling you.
[02:54:51] <greycat> Why are you adding *more* sources if you have the standard ones working?
[02:55:19] <sney> using the DO mirror is probably faster since your VM is on their infrastructure, but it's still just a mirror, you pick 1 mirror and use it for everything 
[02:55:39] <greycat> It looks like mirrors.digitalocean.com does not have the security packages.
[02:55:47] <gordonfish> PMT: I see, and I rather agree, I could just ditch them. They were just there from the beginning of this droplet, though it was more efficient or something, but I'll just 'drop' them, heh
[02:56:10] <greycat> You can use their mirror for the other two, if you want.
[02:56:20] <greycat> You would use it *instead* of the standard one, not in addition.
[02:57:10] <gordonfish> I see. I've been wanting to clean up that sources.list file any how
[02:57:34] <gordonfish> I'd rather keep it as standard as possible, so I'll comment out all of the DO lines.
[02:58:02] <joepublic> if only there were a factoid or something showing the three recommended lines to have 
[02:59:07] <gordonfish> Yes I have those in there already. All updated to deb.debian, debian/security, etc to reflect recent changes, so I should be good to go.

[08:42:25] <binaryhermit> unrelated, but lame has an ancient switch that's something like --r3mix that used to map to a complicated command line, then I believe it mapped to --alt-preset-standard and now it maps to -V (some number that I forget)

[14:35:59] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.

[15:21:23] <Lope> can someone please help me get lisk wallet running with Firejail? I made the appimage file executable, then I'm running it like this:
[15:21:28] <Lope> firejail --appimage --nosound /tmp/lisk-linux-x86_64-2.0.0.AppImage
[15:21:35] <Lope> I get this: Warning: networking feature is disabled in Firejail configuration file
[15:21:43] <Lope> Then it just shuts down, no error.
[15:22:03] <Lope> But networking disabled sounds like a serious problem for a smart contract crypto wallet.
[15:22:09] <Lope> Not sure how to enable normal networking so it can access the internet.
[15:22:24] <Lope>  I tried running it like this: firejail --appimage --nosound --netfilter /tmp/lisk-linux-x86_64-2.0.0.AppImage
[15:22:30] <Lope> Error: networking feature is disabled in Firejail configuration file
[15:22:38] <Lope> This is the wallet https://lisk.com/wallet

[18:21:48] <scottpedia> oh thank you Haohmaru
[18:21:56] <Haohmaru> don't thank me yet
[18:22:32] <scottpedia> So I have a dedicated server that I purchased from Leaseweb.com and it has already become kind of production-ready. Now I want to reinstall the OS because I want to make the root filesystem lvm-enabled for backup conveniences. I tried to use the remote console service of my server’s management firmware but it’s broken somehow… Is there a way that I can do such a reinstallation without
[18:22:34] <scottpedia> interacting with the setup wizard? 
[18:22:51] <n4dir> none of that will help. Just ask your question, scottpedia 
[18:23:20] <Haohmaru> scottpedia is that something similar to digitalocean?
[18:23:30] <PMT> scottpedia: the keyword of the day for you is "preseed", potentially.
[18:23:32] <n4dir> oh, sorry, i missed the other post. sorry again
[18:23:57] <PMT> though doing that blind is...an exciting prospect.

[18:24:31] <dpkg> [preseed] Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the Debian installation process, to allow for a streamlined or completely automated installation.  The <install guide> provides an extensive appendix on preseeding with a full example.  See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed and http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/394 .  See also <debconf-set-selections>.

[18:25:04] <Haohmaru> no idea, i don't even remember if digital ocean offerent me to choose partition details
[18:25:11] <Haohmaru> * offered
[18:25:58] <PMT> scottpedia: A) maybe you should try pretty hard to get the console working by talking to your hosting provider, since they are providing you a paid service, and a key component isn't working?
[18:26:33] <PMT> B) if it's kind-of-production-ready, be sure you have backups before doing this regardless
[18:27:36] <scottpedia> yeah
[18:27:38] <scottpedia> perhabs
[18:27:42] <PMT> C) if you can get additional storage attached to it, you could try to set it up to boot from an LVM-enabled root filesystem on the new storage instead. (If you have room to add a partition on the existing storage, same statement.)
[18:27:50] <Haohmaru> i do wonder if they really install the OS, or they have a pile of ready-made images which they cp onto the thing
[18:28:02] <scottpedia> like I said the service that I purchased is called "dedicated server"
[18:28:27] <scottpedia> it's basically a new physical server bought for you that is rented on a monthly basis
[18:28:58] <Haohmaru> oh
[18:29:43] <scottpedia> Haohmaru: they do. but for me I can only do so via the web portal, which does not enable me to do any pre-installation setup

[18:30:21] <scottpedia> I chose the cheapest plan, whichh includes an old HP server
[18:30:53] <scottpedia> the remote tty feature exists, but depends on java applet or JNIL

[19:51:39] <f-a> I would like to copy some rc file to $OTHER_MACHINE but not all of them (easy) and not all the content of each rc file (difficult)
[19:52:13] <f-a> there are passwords but also bits I do not want to share (i.e. I do not want my irssi conf to have every channel, just work related ones)
[19:52:19] <f-a> how do you people handle this?
[19:52:35] <mrfb> I do that with ansible playbooks
[19:53:51] <mrfb> I don't know how rcm works to be honest.
[19:54:12] <mrfb> also I don't store passwords on dotfiles

Yesterday I was able to post on oftc, but cant connect today so I am in here.   Dmesg and Syslog indicate a problem with X, and I have no functionality after bootup even though I can see everything.  I cant enter data, etc.   Is it possible to reinstall "X" without doing a new install?
