[02:39:35] <Joanna> Oh more videos Iâ€™ll have a look
[02:42:37] <Joanna> Interesting how people can be found so easily
[02:43:22] <Joanna> I donâ€™t much care for modern society media that uses photos
[02:43:49] <Joanna> And phone numbers !
[02:45:41] <Joanna> shibboleth: thanks for info yesterday. Big businesses are always pushing for more intrusiveness for sure.
[02:47:56] <Joanna> It all comes down to what most people will tolerate. I wonder if those things could be tricked by a mask of the face of account owner..

[03:00:35] <Joanna> jan6: that find out who people are sleuth didnâ€™t consider people with deceptive profiles in social media or that use vpn.
[03:01:03] <jan6> yeah, in the end he even says that this was pretty surface level stuff, which it kinda was indeed
[03:01:42] <jan6> also not necessarily deceptive, but even better are similarly named people who're somewhat similar, such as same country
[03:03:29] <Joanna> It seems like online stuff in general caters to convenience at the cost of privacy. Like cell phones retain every number you call. So anyone who gets your cell phone gets all your info
[03:03:54] <jan6> only if they're also able to unlock it
[03:04:08] <Joanna> Or has remote access to said cellphone
[03:04:13] <jan6> same thing
[03:04:33] <jan6> at which point they also get to a bunch of other stuff, like almost nobody constantly logs out of their accounts on movile
[03:04:35] <jan6> *b
[03:04:54] <Joanna> Exactly
[03:05:22] <Joanna> If they grab your phone while you are logged in they get everything
[03:06:13] <jan6> you CAN remotely log out, on most bigger platforms
[03:06:14] <jan6> but still
[03:06:24] <jan6> so can they
[03:06:24] <Joanna> And how hard would it be for someone to run up to a distracted cell phone tapper and snatch the phone and run off
[03:06:31] <jan6> main thing is email, still
[03:07:05] <jan6> if they got your mail, they can just immediately add their own email, remove yours, and hold your accounts hostage (or just download/browse your info in general)
[03:07:25] <jan6> and like, you WANT to get mail notifications, right, so you're gonna stay logged in
[03:07:38] <Joanna> How will you log out if they have your phone :) also good luck with your two factor authentication:)
[03:08:11] <jan6> lol, you coooould have a lock that EVERY app is "locked" with a pin, or fingerprint, or token, or whatever
[03:08:24] <jan6> but who's gonna bother with that, amirite
[03:09:20] <Joanna> Depending upon their laziest
[03:09:42] <Joanna> Laziness they could even have banking apps with saved passwords
[03:11:03] <Joanna> Iâ€™ve heard many people donâ€™t even memorize phone numbers anymore they just rely on phones to store them.
[03:14:19] <jan6> heh
[03:14:27] <jan6> that's what sim cards are for
[03:14:33] <jan6> not phones
[03:15:31] <jan6> related: you could technically store pretty much arbitrary small-size text on a sim card, if you bothered to
[03:26:05] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[03:28:34] <Joanna> I donâ€™t have a cell phone. Is it possible to erase every number you call?
[03:29:05] <Joanna> The cell carriers still have it regardless
[03:40:00] <jan6> sure
[03:40:07] <jan6> sure to both
[03:40:15] <jan6> way more bother than it's worth tho
[03:40:29] <jan6> and just like your ISP can see every website you connect to
[03:41:40] <jan6> if you were completely crazy you coooould run a modem connection over the audio of a phone call, and make a low-quality voip call over THAT
[03:42:07] <jan6> any sane person would probably just use a data connection + vpn or something, to achieve pretty much the same, lol
[03:46:01] <Joanna> There is always privacy for people who know how ..
