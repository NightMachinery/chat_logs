[03:22:49] <iio7> I have a problem understanding the usage of "a" vs "an". I was tought to use "a" for a consonant and "an" for a vowel. But now I read that that is not correct. What matters is whether the first letter of the word sounds like a vowel or a consonant. Alright, that's fine, however the examples I see I don't get.
[03:23:03] <iio7> For example: "a one" and "a unicorn".
[03:23:35] <iio7> Why would someone say that "one" sounds like a consonant? And unicorn, it begins with a vowel and it sounds like a vowel to me.
[03:23:48] <LjL> vowels and consonants are chiefly *sounds*
[03:23:51] <iio7> I am from Scandinavia so perhaps I am missing something.
[03:24:02] <dTal> "won" "yewnicorn"
[03:24:05] <LjL> there is a convention that A E I O U (sometimes Y) are vowel *letters*, but that's not really what "vowel" primarily means
[03:24:31] <dTal> they do sound like consonants, when pronouned aloud
[03:24:44] <dTal> *pronounced
[03:24:48] <LjL> iio7, "one" starts with the semivowel /w/, which is conventionally considered a consonant
[03:24:52] <iio7> Hmm, "won" is a really good example.
[03:25:16] <dTal> Well, I was trying to phonetically spell "one"
[03:25:44] <dTal> LjL did it the fancy way
[03:26:05] <iio7> Is this something one can look up somewhere when in doubt?
[03:26:13] <LjL> the same thing goes for "you" (semivowel /j/) but also for "unique" (there is not a written "y" but it starts with the exact same sound /ju/!)
[03:26:45] <LjL> iio7, yes, you can look up the pronunciation of a word on wiktionary or most dictionaries, and you will find the IPA transcription, and you can look up whether the first symbol in there is a vowel or a consonant
[03:26:52] <iio7> LjL, dTal, thank you both very much!
[03:26:57] <LjL> personally, though, i'd recommend just learning what a vowel is phonetically
[03:27:01] <dTal> LjL is a grammar nerd and I am a native English speaker; I know what's correct, and he knows why :)
[03:28:23] <LjL> "y" starts with a similar sound as "jag" (Swedish) or "jeg" (Norwegian/Danish), and that's kind of obvious because of the initial "y". but even though "unique" has no initial "y", it starts with the same sound. that sound is considered a consonant (specifically a semivowel, which may be a little confusing because that has "vowel" in it, but the "semi" part tells you it counts as a consonant :P)
[03:29:19] <LjL> by the way, "the" changes its pronunciation ("thuh" or "thee") depending on whether a vowel follows, the same way "a/an" does, except it doesn't change the spelling
[03:29:52] <dTal> all of which is a fancy way of saying your mouth needs to close at a least a little between 'a' and the next word or it sounds weird like you're at the dentist
[03:30:09] <LjL> "you" may not be the greatest example of a word you put "a" or "the" in front of, though, i will have to admit
[03:30:27] <dTal> so if the next word starts with an open mouth sound you slip a little 'n' in there to make it sound not weird
[03:30:47] <LjL> that's totally not how it arose, but i'll let it pass
[03:31:09] <dTal> the french solve the same issue by running the two words together, as in l'orange
[03:31:48] <dTal> because "la orange" would sound like you were at the dentist
[03:32:07] <LjL> iio7, you say that "unicorn" sounds like it starts with a vowel. but it's pronounced, using a loose "scandinavian" transcription, "jonik√•rn". is "j" a vowel?
[03:33:45] <iio7> Yes, "unicorn" sounds like it begins with a "j" in a scandinavian transcription.
[03:33:50] <LjL> i think at some point i had an explanation of this on my wiki... but then later they killed my wiki...
[03:34:05] <LjL> iio7, the thing is that it sounds the way it sounds - the way it sounds doesn't depend on its transcription :P
[03:34:19] * dTal thought his explanation was pretty good
[03:34:51] <LjL> dTal, but you do realize dentists were rare in France when that phenomenon arose, and are absolutely unheard of in England
[03:35:11] <dTal> it also sounds like you bit your tongue

[11:54:47] <hexnewbie> How do you call a shop or establishment just below ground level as seen in New York in movies and stuff, where you where the door is a small run of stairs down the street? (Here we call similar shops ‚Äòtraps‚Äô, though I think those are the doorless ones, I don't even know my own language)
[11:56:52] <hexnewbie> Like the stairs going down right below the printers sign https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/e1/07/35e107a8b51653f2227d1902568d756e.jpg

[12:04:47] <AzuiSleet> I can't think of any word that describes a shop that's just below street level, but I imagine you might call a bar or restaurant in such a location a "hole inthe wall" because it may be relatively smal
[12:05:11] <AzuiSleet> "hole in the wall" that is
[12:06:25] <hexnewbie> OK, sorry, I forgot to mention I was looking for search strings in order to search for articles on such shops, particularly interested in seeing how common they are (i.e. if they are a thing, or just something movies do because it looks cool)

[12:11:13] <huf> there's lots of shops/bars like that here
[12:11:28] <huf> well, nearly like that
[12:11:43] <huf> they're in the basements of houses. the stairs are on the inside though
[12:12:59] <AzuiSleet> yes, that's actually the example I was thinking of. In Denver, Colorado there's a speakeasy themed bar that has an entrance like that. You walk down some stairs from street level into a pie shop and ask the waiter to gain entry to the bar

[12:14:47] <pussipupu> I'd just call it a basement <x>

[12:14:55] <huf> whatever they're called
[12:15:05] <huf> london has lots of them so I guess some are pubs now?
[12:15:57] <huf> some pubs are just a single steel door at street level and they open immediately on a stairwell (with low ceilings)
[12:16:01] <hexnewbie> That's somewhat larger than a crammed basement
[12:16:03] <huf> and the entire thing is inside, windowless
[12:16:32] <pussipupu> I've not been to London properly for a while, even pre-plague, but there's a lot of purpose built pubs in London
[12:16:38] <huf> sure

[14:31:00] <Voxel> What do you think? "It seems, the developers made this option in such a way as to let it be available for the automatic procedure."
[14:31:24] <Voxel> "a way as to let it be" sounds weird
[14:31:41] <CuriosTiger> It's grammatically correct, but the sentence sounds clunky.

[14:32:42] <Voxel> I'm trying to say that that option should be also available for some procedure and that's why the developers implement it in such way.

[14:37:34] <hexnewbie> Which is the important thing here, the value added to the automated procedure by the option (or the way it was added), or that it would have been difficult to make the option available during the automated procedure had it been added any other way?
[14:38:09] <hexnewbie> And is it only for the automated procedure, or a general option that should be available there in addition?

[15:09:09] <Voxel> Babar, I don't want to be associated with Russia like any other Lithuanian.
[15:09:13] <CuriosTiger> In this context, yes.
[15:09:20] <Voxel> I don't like this country. Many friends ruined their lives there.
[15:09:30] <Babar> I know, I saw you mention as much before, Voxel, which is what made the association even funnier for me

[15:15:18] <CuriosTiger> My ancestors were indeed vile, but they weren't that great at colonizing. They went more for the pillaging and plundering approach.
[15:15:36] <CuriosTiger> I mean, they did some colonizing. They just weren't very good at it IMHO.
[15:15:38] <Babar> that's one way of getting to the first step
[15:15:54] <CuriosTiger> I mean, who finds North America and then just forgets about it?
[15:16:15] <CuriosTiger> That's an epic fail of colonization.
[15:17:57] <Babar> I like mashing cultures together sometimes. Imagine Viking Native Americans
[15:18:16] <Babar> or Scandanavian Muslims (a la 13th Warrior)
[15:18:31] <CuriosTiger> There probably were Scandinavian muslims.
[15:18:44] <CuriosTiger> I mean, we know the vikings made it to Constantinople
[15:18:46] <Babar> sure, but it wasn't a culture
[15:18:51] <CuriosTiger> some of them probably hung around and converted.
[15:19:02] <Babar> I mean, the goths and the visgoths were muslims at one point too :D
[15:19:03] <CuriosTiger> nope, just assimilation into someone else's culture.
[15:19:26] <StayHungry> Babar: in Russian there are introductory words and phrases, separated by commas, that express the assumption and doubt like 'probably', 'perhaps', 'apparently', and 'it seems' is also one of them. if you remove one from the sentence, then no significant harm will be caused to the meaning, only a shade of uncertainty will disappear.

[18:03:25] <darsie> The least offensive would be best.
[18:03:52] <darsie> Something like lesbian, but for males.
[18:04:25] <cousin_luigi> Now, that's a tricky question.

[18:06:35] <cousin_luigi> And what did you find? I don't think there's a mainstream single word for that that isn't also somewhat offensive.

[18:07:03] <darsie> all but one are marked pej.

[18:08:05] <cousin_luigi> Where do you see that?
