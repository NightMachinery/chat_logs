[01:34:10] <sgt_chuckles> hello
[01:34:46] <sgt_chuckles> can someone help me. Im trying to run a docker container via compose, and I get this error: ERROR: Service 'test_local' failed to build : COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: ../ ()
[01:35:23] <DoofusCanadensis> can't copy from outside of your project directory
[01:35:36] <DoofusCanadensis> which is exactly what that error says
[01:36:21] <sgt_chuckles> is there any way I can?
[01:36:39] <sgt_chuckles> somehow by modifying the dockerfile?
[01:37:11] <sgt_chuckles> im kinda forced to use two different programming languages to test a project
[01:37:12] <gebbione> get the files from the context is the only way
[01:37:30] <sgt_chuckles> and trying to find a way to separate the services
[01:37:31] <DoofusCanadensis> different programming languages is fine
[01:38:03] <DoofusCanadensis> you would need to restructure your directories to put your from directory where the build can see it
[01:38:50] <gebbione> just do something like create a docker folder and then different containers for each application you need like docker/nginx -> docker/php -> docker/django or something and all the files needed for each service in there with their Dockerfile definition
[01:39:06] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:39:44] <gebbione> here is an example https://github.com/bizmate/getting-started-rabbitmq-php-dockerised/
[01:40:07] <gebbione> ie the rabbitmq file is under https://github.com/bizmate/getting-started-rabbitmq-php-dockerised/blob/master/docker/rabbitmq/Dockerfile
[01:40:26] <sgt_chuckles> Is there a way to use `docker-compose run --rm` with multiple services? I need the containers to auto-remove after running them.
[01:40:43] <sgt_chuckles> like: `docker-compose run --rm service_a service_b`
[01:43:17] <gebbione> if your containers stop you can run `docker-compose up && docker-compose down` ... down will run after the up is done
[01:45:10] <sgt_chuckles> ok

[02:10:01] <sartan> hello, strange question. i'm looking at creating docker containers with multiple interfaces, but name the interfaces foo and bar within the container, is it possible to instruct docker how to name the interfaces within the container? The use case here is to generalize some scripting use cases.
[02:10:37] <DoofusCanadensis> docker itself probably doesn't care what's inside the container
[02:10:47] <DoofusCanadensis> depends on what you mean by "interfaces"
[02:10:52] <sartan> kernel netlink interfaces
[02:11:07] *** Quits: Tach (~Tach@user/tach) (Quit: Tach)
[02:11:21] <sartan> the problem is that it seems whenever i bind multiple net interfaces to the kernel, on some docker versions i get an unrdered list and some of them are random, so eth0,eth1,eth2 etc isn't as predictable to the host interface binding as i'd like
[02:11:56] <DoofusCanadensis> oh, that's networking... I'm out
[02:12:20] <DoofusCanadensis> I would hazard a guess that what you are doing isn't really a fit for docker
[02:12:28] <DoofusCanadensis> not everything needs to be containerized
[02:12:33] <sartan> this does =)

[02:21:00] <sartan> it seems the closest I can get here is docker network create -o "com.docker.network.container_iface_prefix"="foo" foo - but this transforms the entire docker network

[19:34:42] <ada_> cart_man: a kubernetes pod has an "outer" container that holds the IP address and some other mount points, and it has containers inside of it that isolate each process.  docker doesn't really have an equivalent to this "nested container" model

[20:00:34] <ada_> cart_man: are you deploying plain containers with docker-compose or are you deploying services with "docker stack deploy"?
[20:01:06] <cart_man> ada_: Yes but when I set it, it has to have deploy: before that. When I put deploy it tells me -> Some services (connectors, gateway) use the 'deploy' key, which will be ignored. Compose does not support 'deploy' configuration - use `docker stack deploy` to deploy to a swarm.
[20:01:33] <cart_man> ada_: plain containers
[20:01:42] <ada_> yeah the v3 syntax is intended for swarm services
[20:01:54] <ada_> if you never ever plan to deploy to swarm you could continue using the v2 syntax

[23:05:57] <ish> From within a container in a docker-compose setup, is there a good way to get at the bridge interface for that compose network?  I want to monitor the network traffic between containers.  I can do this easily from the host, but would like to containerize that as well, ideally without a container using host networking.

[23:19:20] <catbehemoth> hello, I see that there is an issue with docker-compose v2 not respecting runtime parameters on github (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8803), but no comments, I guess there is no fix for now?

[23:23:24] <notEVIL> v2 settings don't work on v3 (which is swarm).  it's confusing that v3 doesn't have v2 things.  I usually stick with v2 things https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/

[23:29:32] <programmerq> there's the app version and the syntax version
[23:29:40] <catbehemoth> app version
[23:29:45] <programmerq> v1.29 sounds like the older python version.
[23:29:55] <programmerq> v2 / v3 syntax would be the version: in the yaml file
[23:30:01] <catbehemoth> I updated from 1.29 to 2 and now nvidia runtime doesnt work
[23:30:03] <programmerq> there is a v2 docker-compose version too
[23:30:13] <catbehemoth> previously all my syntax was on v3 and it all worked fine
[23:30:22] <programmerq> are you still using v3 syntax?
[23:30:26] <catbehemoth> only change was upgrade to v2 of the app

[23:32:13] <catbehemoth> basically v1.29 app with v3 syntax = workng nvidia runtime, v2 app with v3 syntax (and no changes made to docker-compose.yml) and nvidia runtime doesnt work
[23:32:52] <programmerq> sounds like that issue is valid. Follow it and +1 it
[23:33:47] <programmerq> https://github.com/docker/compose/commit/d48068d6e123e03fe0cfdff650318e48a2b85b1d - looks like it was recently added. I don't know if this commit is in a release.
[23:34:07] <tabakhase> axisys na that dir is for certs docker uses to auth when using the tls-http-api - your OS-certstore, /etc/ssl/certs or such (dunno about rhel)
[23:34:37] <tabakhase> and the one to put in there is the CA your firewall uses for the intercepting

[23:43:08] <programmerq> no, v3 syntax was introduced a long long time ago.
[23:43:32] <catbehemoth> programmerq: if I declare default runtime in /etc/docker/daemon.json it should work right away without having to wait for an update right? I mean I already have nvidia runtime defined there so why not make it default and skip declaring it on per container basis all together

[23:44:04] <notEVIL> ah, ok.  sorry for the noise.  ;)
[23:44:18] <programmerq> catbehemoth▸ yes, if you change the default runtime, then dockerd will use that. Based on the commit, it looks like the compose v2 simply wasn't requesting any runtime, which would always end up with whatever the default runtime is.
[23:47:41] <catbehemoth> huh I will probably go that route for now, Ill have to check that no other containers use any other runtimes, but I'm pretty sure I only need nvidia, tensorflow and that sweet sweet NVENC for Plex :)
