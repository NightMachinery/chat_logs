[18:58:11] <rob0> what's the standard test entry for ipv6?  For ipv4 you can query 2.0.0.127.zen.spamhaus.org to get the test listings for Zen.  Is there an ipv6 equivalent?
[19:01:38] <dupondje> Querying IPv6 blocklists
[19:01:40] <dupondje> IPv4 blocklists are queried by prepending the reversed decimal quad address to the zone to be queried. Legacy queries for IPv6 blocklists will use a similar model; the fully expanded IPv6 address is reversed by hex digit and prepended to the zone to be queried. For example, to query the address 2001:DB8:abc:123::42 the IPv6 address would be expanded, reversed and prepended to the zone to be
[19:01:42] <dupondje> queried, to give an example query of:
[19:01:44] <dupondje> 2.4.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.2.1.0.c.b.a.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.zen.spamhaus.org
[19:01:46] <dupondje> :)
[19:02:04] <rob0> that is not the question
[19:02:17] <rob0> I know how to query an ipv6 dnsbl
[19:03:35] <rob0> anyway, your answer, if you have found an IPv6 entry in Zen: yes.
[19:04:14] <rob0> If it's in the zone you can query via DNS, it's in the zone that is transferred via rsync.
[19:09:38] <dupondje> rob0: well the files I've got via rsync seem only to contain ipv4 entries. Weird. I'll check with spamhaus.
[20:35:49] <rob0> do you have an IPv6 address which should be listed?
[20:37:14] <rob0> if you do know one which can be queried from their zone, then it should have been in your copy of the zone.
