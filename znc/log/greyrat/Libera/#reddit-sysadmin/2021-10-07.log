[01:40:47] <Hunterkll> rpifan: unless the job title is grossly inflated, anything that says engineer instead of sysadmin is probably out of your realm right now

[01:41:39] <rpifan> maybe ill get a chance to practice polish
[01:41:42] <bloody> u really need to look at the description of it
[01:41:49] <Lob3rFsociety> I've had someone reach out to me from MS recently in regards to large scale.
[01:41:52] <bloody> thats where you'll know whether you're qualified or not
[01:42:01] <Hunterkll> basically it's often that Enterprise Architect/Sr SysEngineer > Sys Engineer >Sysadmin > Technician > Helpdesk 
[01:42:09] <Lob3rFsociety> I think they've got some jobs opening up in Eastern Europe for wide scale deployment
[01:42:12] <Lob3rFsociety> Azure related though.
[01:42:32] <Lob3rFsociety> @Hunterkll - where would the 3rd line support be? :D 
[01:42:41] <rpifan> well lets wait and see
[01:42:42] <Hunterkll> technician band
[01:44:33] <Hunterkll> I mean, it's a little more broken out in our company..... T1 helpdesk -> T2 -> field services(T2 is actually part of this, we don't really have a "defined" third level per-say other than people who dev the packages/do the deployments to help with bad issues) -> Jr Sysadmin -> Sysadmin -> Sr Sysadmin -> Sysadmin Advisor -> Jr Sys Eng -> Sys Eng -> Sr Syseng -> Syseng Advisor -> Architect -> Enterprise architect
[01:44:34] <Hunterkll> well
[01:44:36] <Hunterkll> something like that
[01:44:40] <Hunterkll> suffice it to say there's a fair amount of levels
[01:44:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:45:04] <Lob3rFsociety> Fair - that's plenty. 
[01:45:13] <Hunterkll> though in reality i'd put jr syseng close to sr sysadmin and sysadmin advisor "this payband is becausae you've been here for 20 years" 
[01:45:14] <hirogen> Sysadmin -> Sysadmin -> Sr Sysadmin -> Sysadmin Advisor -> Jr Sys Eng -> Sys Eng -> Sr Syseng -> Syseng Advisor -> Architect -> Enterprise architect < all our system admins 
[01:45:20] <hirogen> just hype
[01:45:36] <Hunterkll> System Engineer is a blatant promotion over Senior Sysadmin 
[01:45:42] <Hunterkll> but i still bitched anyway when they did the title realignment
[01:45:48] <Hunterkll> cuz it didn't say senior anymore
[01:46:02] <rpifan> i think the issue is im really focused on only remote jobs
[01:46:10] <rpifan> and there are few jobs in germany that will allow me to work from home
[01:46:52] <Hunterkll> "Do you have any degrees or anything to help justify the job title change?" me: "..... I implemented SCCM, SCOM, manage ePO, am helping restructure JAMF, provided the IDAM issuance peices for MFA and support half our servers when no one else can be reache dby phone"
[01:46:55] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:47:09] <Hunterkll> Just tell them to put senior back in the title so my resume looks better damnit
[01:47:20] <rpifan> u dont have a degree?
[01:47:38] <Hunterkll> nnope
[01:47:41] <Hunterkll> and at this point, don't need one

[01:48:45] <Lob3rFsociety> Yeah tbf, I get why you'd need a degree for a junior role... but for a senior role it's super important to have plenty of experience.
[01:49:11] <Hunterkll> i'll take the dude with 1 year experience over the dude with a 2 or 4 year degree and no experience often though
[01:49:30] <Hunterkll> and at some point you get to where education section on the resume just literally doesn't matter unless it's something stupidly impressive 
[01:49:43] <Hunterkll> sure, certifications and shit if you're applying to positions that need that for sure
[01:49:56] <Hunterkll> well, not 'need' but like, at least goes "this person might have a clue for this role"
[01:50:09] <Hunterkll> but I don't even have certifications on my resume, and i'd be embarassed to list the ones I have in this day and age 
[01:50:19] <Lob3rFsociety> Fair. Worst part is that these days you don't even learn about skills that really matter such as git, docker or AWX or other bits and pieces that are super useful.

[01:59:05] <signofzeta> Itanium was the 90's.  But it survived until recently.  Windows Server 2008 R2 was the last release to support IA-64.
[01:59:08] <Hunterkll> Itanium was originally 2001

[02:07:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:07:30] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: i mean, you're either using registry, tzutil, etc 
[02:07:39] <Hunterkll> tzutil you'd be doing it in a bloody logon script or something silly 
[02:07:46] <Hunterkll> so many ways to do it, i'd just pick one and go with it
[02:08:10] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: this one has a slew of options - https://dennisspan.com/configuring-the-time-zone-and-code-page-with-group-policy/
[02:08:52] <Hunterkll> but like i said, script or registry is basically it, how you *get* the settings there is up to you
[02:09:07] <Hunterkll> what fits best is probably related more to what you usually use/do
[02:09:37] <Hunterkll> but timezone *shouldn't* have any effect on timesync, just displayed time to the user.... 
[02:10:04] *** Quits: Lob3rFsociety (~Hubert@90.255.55.115) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:10:22] <Hunterkll> If you've never read it also - there is this, which is more then you'll ever need to know about AD time sync -> https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/50924.active-directory-time-synchronization.aspx
[02:10:38] <Hunterkll> between that one to set the display timezone, and the second to make sure all your settings are right so that it works 100% 
[02:10:49] <Hunterkll> you should get into a good spot
[02:10:55] <Work-BWMerlin> Timesync is fine but because the zone is our the roles are showing as being the next day i.e. to mark Tuesday's role you need to go to Wednesday
[02:11:02] <Hunterkll> (Also, configure 5 NTP sources at least on the PDC)
[02:11:39] <Hunterkll> little known trick that, helps with time accuracy. It takes all 5 poll readings, throws out the lowest and highest, and averages the remaining 3 
[02:12:13] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: ahhhh so it really is just display issues, yea, then setting display TZ is what you need, - like i said, first link gives you all the real options that are sane, so just pick one and roll with it
[02:12:44] <Work-BWMerlin> The link I posted uses the first option from the link you posted so seems good enough
[02:12:50] <zerocool> so like, lets say you phish your own employees... what is the best way to "train" & quiz them afterwords?
[02:13:17] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: yea, it's just kind of like, if you normally deploy stuff via powershell script with SCCM like this instead of GPO, or you use logon scripts, etc 
[02:13:31] <Hunterkll> the one that makes sense is the one that lines up with how you do other similar things
[02:13:52] <Work-BWMerlin> Well I have made a GPO, set the security filtering to my device so just need to reboot to see if it works
[02:14:14] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: i half wonder if just a gpupdate would make it tick over
[02:14:24] <Hunterkll> never thought about what/where the clock applet reads from or how often it does
[02:14:34] <Work-BWMerlin> I am honestly surprised there isn't a premade policy that allows you to set the timezone via dropdown menu
[02:15:10] <Work-BWMerlin> Well wonder no more, it doesn't (at least not for me, I will better able to tell after a restart)
[02:15:28] <Hunterkll> ha, depends on the refresh interval i guess maybe
[02:15:34] <Hunterkll> i know if you use tzutil to set timezone it works instantly
[02:15:49] <Work-BWMerlin> Going to gpresult to see if policy has applied first
[02:15:57] <signofzeta> I know you can use the tzutil command to set it, but that's only half the battle.
[02:16:56] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: hm?
[02:17:25] <signofzeta> tzutil /s "Pacific Standard Time", for example -- but deploying that command is up to the sysadmin.
[02:17:33] <Work-BWMerlin> Okay, gpresult doesn't show it as getting the policy, will wait for replication

[17:53:37] <Jaelae> dunno how i feel about this centered start menu on windows 11. I keep looking to the left corner when i hit the windows key
[17:53:43] <thegodsquirrel> Well, don't the warheads just reach orbit, not the entire missile?
[17:53:44] <int0x1C8> sure ICBMs can reach orbit if you take out the warheads and warhead bus and replace it with a upper stage
[17:54:03] <bloody> Jaelae, I was told you can change it back to it being on the left
[17:54:12] <int0x1C8> but an ICBM that puts the warheads in orbit kinda defeats the point of a ballistic missle
[17:54:15] <vinrock> i thought its the entire missile and the warhead deploys upon reentry
[17:54:23] <mistiry> Jaelae: im almost used to it already
[17:54:23] <Jaelae> yea bloody  you can. i just am gonna see if i start enjoying it
[17:54:32] <mistiry> ive kept it centered to see how it goes
[17:54:36] <mistiry> so far its not that big of a deal
[17:54:49] <mistiry> really my biggest issue so far is not having the clock on both monitors. 
[17:54:53] <mistiry> which is pretty minor
[17:54:59] <bloody> on the taskbar?
[17:55:02] <mistiry> yeah
[17:55:06] <bloody> that would annoy me
[17:55:16] <mistiry> taskbar can stretch to both screens, but not the clock
[17:55:19] <int0x1C8> vinrock, usually 1 or 2 stages to get to a very high suborbital trajectory, then the warhead has a maneuver module to tweak course and final impact before reentry
[17:55:20] <Jaelae> i hear people complain about the clock
[17:55:25] <Jaelae> but i normally disable the taskbar on the second monitor
[17:55:38] <mistiry> im the opposite i want the taskbar and clock and everything
[17:55:42] <int0x1C8> the RVs detach from the hub just before reentry when the course has been fixed
[17:55:43] <mistiry> because if im gaming i want to see that stuff
[17:55:43] <vinrock> ah
[17:55:57] <bloody> yeah when you have a fullscreen app on your main monitor there is no way to tell the time
[17:56:05] <mistiry> yep, which is my issue with it.
[17:56:12] <mistiry> a minor one, but still an annoyance
[17:56:20] <vinrock> have you tried to connect to a vpn yet
[17:56:23] <vinrock> its slow as fuckballs
[17:56:31] <vinrock> apparently fix is coming in a week or two
[17:56:36] <int0x1C8> then there's a small rocket on the back of each RV that spins them up
[17:56:49] <int0x1C8> so they're spin stabilized through reentry
[17:57:09] <mistiry> no, i dont have any VPNs to connect to from where i have w11 installed. supposed i could get my PIA app installed and try that
[17:57:09] <PublicWiFi> vinrock: built-in client or any vpn client?
[17:57:17] <vinrock> using the built-in client
[17:57:24] <vinrock> its basicaly unusable

[20:54:41] <Hunterkll> not document/write it down
[20:54:54] <Hunterkll> i think passport # was the only thing they actually recorded, and they scanned the first page of the bill
[20:54:57] <vinrock> actually I did try insoles when i was working in construction and they did help my back

[21:24:48] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i mean, if you're updating the binaries

[21:25:04] <sd> 11<H​otmess> deb is just a packaging format its more like zip with some verions control
[21:25:04] <Hunterkll> right now anyway
[21:25:26] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> @Hotness You just described every packaging format.
[21:25:27] <Activ8> I'm unpacking a .deb just to see what's inside it
[21:25:29] <signofzeta> Linux has no native package manager.  That's up to the distributions.  But, despite snaps' imperfections, they are a pretty good way to distribute software.
[21:25:31] <iphone> they should take the dev hours sunk into dpkg and rpm/yum/dnf and make one of those tools the standard
[21:25:32] <Hunterkll> snap can be layered on top of other distros but it's got quirks everywhere
[21:25:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> personaly id just give em the source and be done with it
[21:25:35] <Hunterkll> Activ8: three files
[21:25:40] <signofzeta> inb4 snap install powershell --classic
[21:26:04] <Hunterkll> Activ8: you'll have debian-binary which tells the version nu mber, control which has the scripts and meta information to do stuff, and data, which has the actual files to be installed
[21:26:08] <iphone> signofzeta: linux has no init system, but most distros use systemd. Having a similar situation for package management would be great
[21:26:15] <Activ8> ahhh
[21:26:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i mean if you wanna create a ps deb its a bit pointless just pull it form the repos instead
[21:26:19] <Hunterkll> Activ8: you may be able to just update the files in data and update the metadata 
[21:26:21] <Activ8> yes that's what is in it Hunterkll
[21:26:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> 🤷
[21:26:30] <Hunterkll> inside control
[21:26:38] <Hunterkll> if literally the only th ing that's changing is the resulting output binary files
[21:26:49] <Hunterkll> you'll want to make sure that they're compiled the same way (dependancies and shit) 
[21:26:53] <Activ8> I don't see a control file, just unzipped the .deb on a windows box maybe it's a hidden file?
[21:27:01] <signofzeta> iphone: I've been using Linux for 15 years.  I remember init scripts, then the `service` command.  I generally like and use systemd despite its breach of philosophy.
[21:27:02] <Hunterkll> it's a tar file
[21:27:11] <Hunterkll> control.tar and data.tar
[21:27:17] <Activ8> there's a data.tar no control.tar at all there

[21:38:16] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: i figured it wasn't on par with DBAN, but that's good enough for my remote users
[21:38:27] <Hunterkll> DBAN is pretty worthless
[21:38:30] <Hunterkll> only need a single 0-pass 
[21:38:38] <Hunterkll> or cryptographic destruction, which is even more preferrable
[21:38:56] <signofzeta> I prefer a random-pass myself, but that's also fine
[21:39:02] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> yeah anything but single pass shit is a waste of time IMO
[21:39:04] <iphone> DBAN is fine

[21:39:15] <Hunterkll> It's not an "IMO" 
[21:39:34] <Hunterkll> NIST has outright said since ATA drives of 15GB or larger capacity, anything more than a 0 pass is a waste, and a 0 pass will prevent labratory reconstruction

[21:40:12] <Hunterkll> Just like the "DoD wipe" is a total myth

[21:41:08] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: while, of course, classified drives are still destroyed physically, it's NOT considered a data leak if you 0-pass wipe a drive for reuse to another project/same classification level agency, and it gets stolen in transit

[21:41:47] <signofzeta> "Mmm, these are some good s'mores.  You can really taste the burning 1's.  The 0's impart an off-taste, though."
[21:41:50] <Hunterkll> physical destruction is just a "100000% sure" method, but a ATA secure erase'd drive (which just does that pass) is considered safe to lose
[21:42:09] <signofzeta> I always use ATA Secure Erase for my stuff.
[21:42:10] <Hunterkll> well, not safe for your job/paperwork load
[21:42:16] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> me, an intellectual: you can't be more than 100% sure
[21:42:19] <Hunterkll> but safe as in "not considered a data leak event" 
[21:42:26] <Hunterkll> so you get in trouble for losing the hardware, not for losing classified data 
[21:42:45] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> now ATA secure erase has been known to juts not work sometimes

[21:43:09] <Hunterkll> :p
[21:43:14] <Hunterkll> but
[21:43:20] <Hunterkll> cryptographic destruction is considered good enough!
[21:43:28] <Hunterkll> the same level as the other methods
[21:43:38] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> I mean there's not much difference between secure erase and a zero pass unless you're worried about reallocated sectors or whatever

[23:04:57] <Hunterkll> also, yea, it'll run slow as dog shit if that's an SMR drive too and it's only doing like block-at-a-time writes

[23:47:50] <Hunterkll> i've been seeing that on server 2022 
[23:48:01] <Hunterkll> hoping next weeks patch helps, waiting for that before I open a ticket
[23:48:10] <Activ8> nope it was like as soon as I turned on my VM I got an instant BSOD
[23:48:12] <Hunterkll> it keeps taking out my RDS licensing server and AAD connect server
[23:48:17] <Hunterkll> oh huh
[23:48:18] <Activ8> and then the system wouldn't come back up
[23:48:25] <Activ8> I just had to do a full re-install on my desktop
[23:48:26] <Hunterkll> won't shutdown/reset?
[23:48:30] <Hunterkll> oh that's weird
[23:48:39] <Hunterkll> haven't seen that on W11 client at all and i bang the hell out of my VMs
[23:48:51] <Activ8> it froze, on bootup got a really strange error and wouldn't reset either
[23:49:06] <Hunterkll> being stuck in reset is an issue i've seen on 2022
[23:49:07] <Activ8> I'm back running now did a full install again
[23:49:34] <Activ8> critical process died was the error message
[23:49:38] <Activ8> BSOD
[23:49:42] <Activ8> on bootup
[23:49:53] <sd> 09<H​aise> I haven't encountered that on my DCs yet
[23:49:57] <Hunterkll> ah so it's in the guest, not the guest freezing entirely
[23:50:01] <Activ8> I'm on win 11 not a dc
[23:50:08] <Activ8> no it was the host
[23:50:15] <Activ8> a full freeze on the main host
[23:50:16] <Hunterkll> the host died?
[23:50:23] <Activ8> yep
[23:50:28] <Activ8> killed the main host
[23:50:29] <Hunterkll> that I definitely haven't seen 
[23:50:29] <Activ8> dead
[23:50:36] <Activ8> you won't it was on win 11
[23:50:37] <Hunterkll> sounds like something else was fucky 
[23:50:44] <Hunterkll> Activ8: all my workstations are running win11
[23:50:46] <Hunterkll> all of them
[23:50:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:50:49] <Hunterkll> have been for months 
[23:50:50] <Activ8> with hyper v
[23:50:53] <Hunterkll> yes
[23:50:56] <Hunterkll> i use hyper-v on all my devices
[23:51:04] <Activ8> are they running on not req hardware
[23:51:06] <Hunterkll> the hypervisor itself is required at this point 
[23:51:11] <Activ8> i.e uefi, tpm, cpu
[23:51:14] <Hunterkll> only one is 
[23:51:22] <Activ8> might be realted
[23:51:25] <Activ8> related*
[23:51:26] <Hunterkll> none have secure boot on 
[23:51:33] <Hunterkll> two don't have TPM owned (it's managed by a linux install instead) 
[23:51:35] <Activ8> no secure boot on mine 
[23:51:44] <Activ8> hmmm something else may have caused it then
[23:51:53] <Hunterkll> actually wait, my surface pro 2017 isn't compliant either, so 
[23:51:53] <Activ8> I don't want to put hyper-v back on
[23:52:00] <Activ8> my system was stable until i did that
[23:52:07] <Activ8> couldn't even get into error logs
[23:52:17] <Hunterkll> make that two systems with active heavy hyper-v use that aren't compliant
[23:52:34] <Activ8> well can't be that then otherwise you would have had the issues as well
[23:52:58] <Activ8> I keep checking my event logs now see if any errors appear for anything
[23:53:02] <Activ8> might give me a clue next time
[23:53:41] <Activ8> I'm keeping my data off 11 till it's stable
[23:53:46] <Hunterkll> could have been FS corruption because of an unrelated crash, i mean, critical process died, i'd want to retrieve the logs and see what actually died, and/or fix the install to find that out 
[23:54:12] <bloody> lol check it https://twitter.com/jsnover/status/1445896776066629635
[23:54:19] <Activ8> only probably way to fix the install is an over the top install
[23:54:21] <Activ8> I assume
[23:54:27] <Hunterkll> no?
[23:54:33] <Hunterkll> lots of ways to fix things lol
[23:54:39] <Hunterkll> just like you'd fix a linux install, just different tooling
[23:54:51] <Activ8> I didn't want to know what caused it
[23:54:56] <Activ8> I just wanted my system back up and running
[23:55:03] <Hunterkll> heh
[23:55:16] <Hunterkll> Activ8: but there's an 80% chance hyper-v is already running anyway
[23:55:37] <Activ8> it wasn't enabled 2 hours ago before i enabled it
[23:55:41] <Hunterkll> open 'msinfo32' and see if any virtualization-based seucrity stuff is on 
[23:55:42] <Hunterkll> no
[23:55:50] <Hunterkll> that's the hyper-v host compute service + management tools
[23:55:53] <Hunterkll> not necessarily hyper-v itself
[23:55:58] <Hunterkll> the bare base hypervisor
[23:55:58] <Activ8> oh
[23:56:16] <Activ8> there is
[23:56:17] <Hunterkll> if VBS is running, then you're running hyper-v and even your desktop OS isn't running "bare metal"

[23:59:16] <Activ8> my board 100% doesn't have TPM either
[23:59:34] <Hunterkll> fTPM functionality is reliant on both CPU having some hardware bits in it, and motherboard supporting it 
[23:59:35] <Activ8> I bypassed it on install, maybe hyper-v is causing a crash
[23:59:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:59:48] <Hunterkll> I wouldn't think so, otherwise i'd be seeing the same crashes for the past year or so
