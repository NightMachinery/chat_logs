[06:25:08] <concrete-houses> can awk do a lottery?  say there are 15000 people who enter a lottery for different hunting licenses    they have to be randomly picked then the picked winnder start with winner 1 and contestatn has 10 choices for the license they want so if license 1 is avialble winner 1 gets it and moves on  if choice 1 not then choice 2 if avialable etc
[06:25:30] <concrete-houses> now if the winner gets license then the supply of that license has to be decremented 1

[06:32:32] <nmz1> sure, but that look like a PITA to do with awk
[06:35:06] <emanuele6> also awk's rand() is probably not random enough for a fair lottery
[06:36:25] <emanuele6> but sure you can do it
[06:40:19] <emanuele6> so you get an hunting license by winning it at a lottery? is that how it works?
[06:41:44] <concrete-houses> well the state says only X amont of deer license in spring 2022
[06:41:47] <concrete-houses> fo example
[06:42:33] <concrete-houses> government goons rapeing everyone 
[06:42:51] <concrete-houses> and bio academic goosn saying well we gota count the deer and make a carrer out fo it
[06:43:20] <concrete-houses> probly cheaper bio goons run deer zoo keep and breed deer then multiple and unleash em if hunted to extinciton
[06:43:31] <concrete-houses> instera dof toruring everyone wallet n time with stupid hunteing crap
[06:43:43] <concrete-houses> but cops n agents of state also make career out fo fuckign with hunters not in complaince
[06:43:51] <nmz1> what does this have to do with anything
[06:43:52] <concrete-houses> funny today saw there is paraplegic deer license
[06:44:08] <nmz1> well emanuele6 did ask I guess
[06:44:26] <concrete-houses> and rhode island abnned thsi thign where you log in ove rphoen or video net somehow to somewon with rifle and you tell or control the hunter whent o shoot th edeer rometely to enjoy the expercen
[06:44:50] <concrete-houses> law on the boosk ot keep me from videoing my hunting and you call the shot shen i shoot deer
[06:45:01] <concrete-houses> i guess that must have been a thing for it to get banned
[06:47:10] <concrete-houses> liek remote hunting over vidoe tie in
[06:47:12] <concrete-houses> funky
