[01:57:59] <catbeard> RE: my question, could it be a python rounding error?
[01:58:23] <PlanckWalk> catbeard: What was the question?
[01:58:52] <catbeard> > any ideas about this? https://kopy.io/4s0AN#CPjLFpaQn4KhFL - does this seem to be python weirdness or math weirdness
[01:59:23] <PlanckWalk> I don't see any rounding or errors
[01:59:36] <PlanckWalk> Maybe I just don't understand python well enough.
[01:59:40] <catbeard> check the 10 hint though

[01:59:59] <PlanckWalk> What node 10?
[02:00:25] <catbeard> in the nodes output
[02:00:26] <PlanckWalk> Would I need to run the code or something and it generates a "node 10"?
[02:00:29] <catbeard> he says that
[02:00:43] <Guest1778> I also am not sure about that channel, kmh.
[02:00:46] <catbeard> the number always goes up then down symmetrically

[02:03:47] *** Quits: nonfxnl1 (~Thunderbi@user/nonfxnl) (Client Quit)
[02:03:56] <PlanckWalk> It's inefficient, but not incorrect
[02:04:08] <kmh> catbeard, for instance C(100,100) is one
[02:04:08] <PlanckWalk> I think the question here is about correctness, isn't it?
[02:04:19] <catbeard> yeah
[02:04:32] <kmh> and doing 100!/100! to compute it is just nuts
[02:04:45] <PlanckWalk> But still correct
[02:05:32] <PlanckWalk> I'm more interested in what the output numbers are supposed to mean, and therefore why one would expect them to "go up and then go down"
[02:05:38] <kmh> oh sure it is mathematically correct but you quickly will run into performance and possible rounding/precision errors (if there there is a conversion into floats at some point)
[02:06:12] <catbeard> i'm assuming they are graphed points

[03:13:55] <Dflipflop> Ergo us a font with a better em size, thats the imaginary box around chars. Or change the font size which may calculate the em size better, such font size 9 sucks use 10 or 8

[03:16:19] <Dflipflop> typically font files are not full of every size, inbettween sizes are just scaled, hence for some inane reasons win10  make it look terrible since some defaults are size 9, for example. Same can be seen in Linux's horrendous TrueType render

[04:27:49] <alphamule> You can also use any curve you want.  Similar to how you can graph with polar coordinates.

[15:47:58] <Z-module> So there's some error in the notes.
[15:48:03] <Ethos> I was thinking in a similar example with (-1)^n
[15:48:38] <Ethos> Maybe it has to do with S_n being the alternating series
[15:48:39] <Z-module> but if  lim S_n   exists (the series converges), then of course the individual terms -> 0
[15:49:23] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[15:49:24] <Ethos> Nah they conclude that lim S_n exists because lim {S_(3n)-S_(3n-1)} = lim {S_(3n)-S_(3n-2)} = 0
[15:49:45] <Ethos> But I dont follow that equalities
[15:50:10] <node1> I would likes to know how to represent cartersian product of three set i.e A*B*C in tuple representation form?
[15:50:45] <Z-module> node1, the elements of A x B x C   are just the ordered 3-tuples  (a,b,c)  with a in A, b in B, c in C
[15:50:59] <node1> For instance A = { 1, 2 }, B = { 4, 6, 9 } which gives A x B = { (1,4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9) }
[15:51:16] <Z-module> same idea again, just using triples now
[15:51:22] <Ethos> Maybe it has to do with S_n being the alternating series

[15:51:37] <node1> So when another set appears let set C ={ 3, 5}  Then how to represent into tuples?
[15:51:51] <Z-module> Ethos: is this whole thing viewable somewhere?
[15:51:52] <node1> A * B * C =  { (1,4,3), (1, 6,3), (1, 9, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 6, 3), (2, 9, 3), (1,4,3), (1, 6, 5), (1, 9, 5), (2, 4, 5), (2, 6, 5), (2, 9, 5) }  this way ?
[15:52:21] <Z-module> yes node1: triples (a,b,c) where all choices of a in A and all of b in B and all of c in C get used
[15:52:21] <Ethos> Z-module yeah but its on spanish, gonna post it in mathb.in in english
[15:52:55] <node1> And it's exactly 12 which is equal to #A =2, #B= 3, #C = 2 => A*B*C= 12

[16:25:41] <Z-module> Ethos: they didn't do it right, that implication on its face makes no sense, but the conclusion is right. We *do* know the sequence (S_(3n)) converges to a finite limit L (that happens to be (1/2)ln(2)), as they showed up there. And also all the individual terms -> 0 here.  So given eps > 0, pick N large enough so that for all n >= N :    |S_(3n) - L| < eps/3,  |a_(3n+1)| < eps/3,  |a_(3n_2)| < eps/3.  Then |S_(3n+1) - L| = |S_(3n) +
[16:25:41] <Z-module> a_(3n+1) - L| <= |S_(3n) - L| + |a_(3n+1)| < (2/3)eps   and

[16:31:09] <Ethos> So in general, if {x_n} is a convergent sequence and if {x_(3n)} goes to L, then {x_n} goes to L right?

[16:33:48] <Ethos> I assumed {x_n} is convergent
[16:34:20] <Z-module> This is very typical in analysis and related things. For example it's rather easy to show (for the Prime Number Theorem) that *if*   lim_{x -> infty}  (# of primes <= x) / (x/log(x))   exists, the limit must be 1. The content of the PNT is showing that it exists at all.

[16:46:02] <Ethos> Yeah its kinda obvious like this
[16:46:37] <Gurkenglas> Unrelated: Again! I keep encountering a (2-?)category where a lot of the functions end up at R and there are two-cells between such functions which look either like "one function is pointwise smaller than the other" or "here's a measure with respect to which one function's integral is smaller than the other's".

[16:51:01] <Ethos> If you compute directly lim {S_(3n) - S_(3n-1)} from the computations it goes to 0, and from here its obvious that S_(3n-1) converges to S_(3n). Same for the other equality. Then what we just did is {x_n} goes to x iff {x_2n} goes to x and {x_(2n-1} goes to x

[21:20:51] <Neurite> loadedanvils: Yeah I just did actually, right before reading that.
[21:22:21] <Neurite> (x + y)^n is basically like (1 + (-1))^n, and (1 + (-1))^n = 0^n = 0.
[21:22:36] <Neurite> But I guess I'm more caught up with how to "prove" it.
[21:22:49] <Neurite> I'm not entirely certain as to what format that is.
[21:22:50] <loadedanvils> That’s how you prove it
[21:23:09] <Neurite> So that's it? I thought I needed some specific format or something.

[21:23:22] <loadedanvils> Let x = -1, and y = 1, by the Binomial theorem (x + y)^n = the expansion
[21:23:41] <loadedanvils> and since (x + y)^n = 0 for all positive n, the expansion = 0
[21:24:00] <loadedanvils> well, either it’s the expansion or the negative of the expansion, but negative zero is zero
[21:26:13] <Neurite> I kind of get it, but I feel like I'm still missing something.
[21:26:25] <loadedanvils> actually, yeah, if you keep x=1 and y=-1 then you have exactly that expansion
[21:26:42] <loadedanvils> Basically you can convert (1 + (-1))^n into exactly the statement shown
[21:27:24] <Neurite> So basically in order to prove something, in this case, I create a chain of equalities?
[21:27:34] <loadedanvils> yeah
[21:27:57] <Neurite> So when it comes to proving something in math, it's either a chain of equalities and/or logical propositions?
[21:28:21] <loadedanvils> pretty much
[21:28:52] <Neurite> Interesting. I guess that was the part that I was mostly caught up on. The form behind a "proof".

[22:01:20] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: the people who made category theory were doing so to understand geometric/spatial concepts better, have you looked at homological algebra, algebraic geometry and topology, work of Grothendieck and Lawvere?
[22:02:12] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, the reason i like my reformulation of limits is that i don't see a reason to be interested in "for every cone there exists a unique morphism" but i do see the neatness of "instead of talking about cones we can talk about morphisms"
[22:02:18] <mycroftiv> Sheaves in geometry and logic by MacLane and Moerdijk is all about how Lawvere's work in categorical foundations provides a unification of geometric and logical concepts via the topos notion
[22:02:42] <Gurkenglas> i have not looked at their work.
[22:03:47] <mycroftiv> in the end its always better to understand more than less, life is short but the mathematical context and purposes that category theory was originally used in and how people thought about things and why is relevant to some of your questions i think
[22:05:20] <mycroftiv> theres a progression of ideas from integers -> abelian groups -> chain complexes and exact sequences and how these algebraic ideas relate to geometric and topological concepts that is really core to why category theory is what it is

[23:12:08] <Al-Khwarizmi> although I know COQ uses it almost exclusively in propositional logic
[23:12:43] <int-e> In any case we'd need to know more about the particular logic you're using.

[23:22:06] <int-e> And proving a -> (b -> a) really shouldn't use an indirect proof. (It works, but it's overkill.)
[23:22:34] <Al-Khwarizmi> yeah that one is my fault
[23:22:42] <Al-Khwarizmi> I could have just done it in two steps
[23:22:49] <int-e> yeah I get it, all they know is how to translate -> into a disjunction and use equational reasoning
[23:23:07] <int-e> which sucks, because it will stop working for first-order logic.
[23:23:08] <Al-Khwarizmi> a ∨ ~b

[23:23:13] <Al-Khwarizmi> right?
[23:24:45] <Al-Khwarizmi> int-e: oh yeah, there are *laws* that let us get from fol to 0th order

[23:24:52] <int-e> (that last paste is nearly unreadable, since it's lacking the justification for each line)
[23:25:19] <Al-Khwarizmi> generalizing variables and instantiating them, although I haven't read the part yet, just glossed over
[23:27:38] <int-e> not sure what to suggest though; there's a few dozen inference rules that you can use (E1..E18, maybe more, I1.. who knows how many), and your TA should accept any proof using those correctly, whether they like it or not.
[23:28:20] <int-e> I kind of suspect that proving A -> B by showing A |- B is one of those rules.
[23:28:50] <int-e> (that is, assume A, show B)
[23:31:18] <int-e> It's worth noting that I have no clue what those rules are (a few can be inferred from the earlier paste). I prefer smaller systems.

[23:34:00] <Al-Khwarizmi> anyway, I guess I'll just use deduction theorem and fight the ta for it. It is gonna be a pain but at least he can show me the other solution if it exists.
[23:34:12] <riv> pounce: lol
[23:34:47] <int-e> (which is: to show A -> B, assume ~B, then show ~A)

[23:35:14] <Al-Khwarizmi> yep contraposition is one of those
[23:35:30] <Al-Khwarizmi> but direct proof is basicaly deduction theorem
[23:36:18] <int-e> and you prove that how? by deriving it through a proof by contradiction?
[23:36:20] <Al-Khwarizmi> but he won't have it lol. In any case thanks for the help riv and int-e. Proof by deduction theorem dereived by intimidation is gonna be my approach

[23:39:24] <int-e> (Normally, I don't have any deduction theorem; I have an inference rule for implications. The only exception is Hilber-style systems which have modus ponens (from A and A -> B, infer B) as their sole inference rule and just two propositional axiom schemas: A -> (B -> A) and (A -> (B -> C)) -> ((A -> B) -> (A -> C)) -- both of which have come up above)
[23:40:12] <int-e> (So you trade in the *natural* implication introduction rule for having a smaller system, and then that rule becomes a provable theorem instead.)
[23:40:40] <int-e> It makes no sense to me to give up implication introduction as a rule in a system that is huge (in terms of inference rules) anyway.
[23:41:14] <int-e> In summary, it's all wrong. ;-)
[23:42:35] <Al-Khwarizmi> wait, I can use modes ponens but how is that a substitute for deduction theorem?
[23:42:39] <int-e> Al-Khwarizmi: To be clear, it's probably still equivalent to the usual propositional logic, with the usual soundness and completeness properties one would expect. But it seems rather unprincipled (yay, I avoided saying "ugly").
[23:43:22] <int-e> Al-Khwarizmi: You need the right axioms for modus ponens alone to be sufficient.
[23:44:38] <Al-Khwarizmi> oh I see. The class is for computer science maybe that's why it's so jumbled. Later chapters have set theory and I asked if it was zfc or some other system he said don't worry about that just worry about the text...
[23:44:40] <int-e> Oh and I also forgot one axiom, the ((A -> B) -> A) -> A thing, that makes the logic classical.
