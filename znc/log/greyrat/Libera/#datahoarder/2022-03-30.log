[00:49:00] <skye0> yeah, my parents might switch to Sky (ISP). It's gonna make hoarding a bit more difficult since the default content filter is... heavy-handed (they may refuse to disable it specifically for my sister, even though she doesn't really do any weird shit online)
[00:49:39] <skye0> main problem is intermittent internet outages i think which are tied to the limited capabilities of virgin media's hub, plus, my father is dissatisfied with how much he's paying for VM
[00:50:26] <skye0> Using mobile hotspot for internetting isn't that ideal, because for one, it forces me to use wireless connections, and disabling the content filter never works even though I am over 18 and own a debit card

[02:43:37] <skye0> i'm stuck with not knowing what i want to do in my spare time. granted, i have like two more interviews to go through but i'm gonna be really pissed if i don't make this one
[02:43:42] <ThePendulum> "you need NordVPN because you haven't got a clue what TLS is"
[02:45:10] <skye0> i'd need NordVPN because fuck Sky, but i'd only pay for sub-par privacy only if it meant I wanted to hoard something I can't find elsewhere like a free CoD game (to play, but they're not worth hoarding because their shit release schedule is nauseating for anyone who actually doesn't give a shit about shooters)

[02:47:05] <skye0> i have also some unfinished projects because the one software i've tried to use (don't want to say) is now fucking archived
[02:47:09] <ThePendulum> I think it's supposed to be 100mbps but I'm getting 280mbps easily atm
[02:47:22] <skye0> so if it has errors, i'm fucked, with my very limited knowledge of python (the program uses TensorFlow)
[02:47:49] <ThePendulum> learning opportunity
[02:47:53] <skye0> ThePendulum good. i'll start paying up if Murdoch internet is officially what I have to put up with at home
[02:48:23] <skye0> i personally wish i were more proficient at programming just to create games, but while i can use godot engine, i would need to learn to do 3d modeling too
[02:48:25] <skye0> that game is still held back
[02:48:41] <ThePendulum> if you're mainly using it to get around blocks and not so much privacy you can always disable it for a minute if you want to stream something huge that's not blocked anyway
[02:48:54] <skye0> part of me should be self-employed and be a twitch streamer so i actually have time for my personal projects but i don't want to expose myself in pubilc any more
[02:49:12] <ThePendulum> do a no face channel
[02:49:30] <skye0> ThePendulum I prefer to download over stream stuff. i do stream, but nothing that would be illegal to even access without paying up (i.e. youtube, twitch)
[02:49:38] <skye0> although i do try to use adblock and/or alternative frontends
[02:49:48] <skye0> that might be an issue depending on how paranoid sky's filter is
[02:50:25] <skye0> youtube doesn't deserve anything but to become a public archival site funded by american taxpayers' money, twitch just needs to somehow sever its ties with amazon
[02:50:52] <skye0> i need to plan my leave but i'm having to use it up for interviews just because i want to change jobs
[02:53:28] <skye0> I've still gotten recognized by other Twitch streamers even though I've never streamed, never shown my face and changed my name (might be my profile or the way i type)

[04:27:09] <parted> for an actual computer w a GPU its great

[06:27:12] <auctus> ideally i will set it up, it will someday alert me to an error, i'll unplug a drive, plug another one in, and continue for several more years
[06:27:20] <auctus> without having to go buy some oreilly book about how raid works
[06:27:21] <auctus> or whatever
[06:27:47] * auctus starts writing a base 3 filesystem
[06:27:58] <ketas> no zfs?
[06:28:40] <auctus> maybe, i dont know if installing some other OS on this qnap gadget is a hassle, i might leave it be and buy a another SBC or something to act as an application server
[06:28:47] <auctus> ...those are all sold out everywhere though, it seems.
[06:29:14] <ketas> have to buy x86 now
[06:30:12] <ketas> likely used... since it takes years to get it into normal state again
[06:31:52] <auctus> i saw a raspberry pi form factor x86 board, of course thats also sold out
[06:32:11] <auctus> having the GPU of an nvidia jetson at hand sounds super cool too but i fucked around too long and those are also sold out

[06:52:22] <auctus> im gonna really struggle not to immediately fill this NAS up with every videogame released and unreleased ever made
[06:52:43] <auctus> or you know, the 3 most recently released games given that they're all 100 damn gigabytes now

[14:29:22] <analoq> why is it that privacy focused p2p solutions aren't replacing torrent?
[14:30:26] <analoq> e.g. Gnunet, perfect dark etc.
[14:30:56] <NeoThermic_II> momentum
[14:31:01] <analoq> I mean they exist and probably are being used somewhat, but by the looks of it the usage is orders of magnitudes lower than torrent
[14:31:20] <NeoThermic_II> torrents are easy, everyone has a torrent client, and all the software built around the torrent ecosystem expects torrents
[14:31:37] <analoq> NeoThermic_II: yeah, but why are they lacking momentum? There certainly should be sufficient motivation for adoption (law enforcement)
[14:31:48] <NeoThermic_II> so if you want to replace torrents, you gotta start implementing support for the new stuff in existing places
[14:32:06] <NeoThermic_II> law enforcement is only seen by a small percentage of people using torrents
[14:32:18] *** NeoThermic_II is now known as NeoThermic
[14:32:44] <analoq> it's removing whole countries from the userbase.
[14:33:29] <analoq> i doubt many in japan, germany etc. would knowingly torrent movies these days
[14:34:42] <analoq> obv. users with seedboxes and access to private trackers excluded
[14:34:56] <NeoThermic> that's the thing
[14:35:15] <NeoThermic> the ecosystem of torrents means it's easier for people to move to private trackers or seedboxing rather than swap out the core tech
[14:35:30] <NeoThermic> this is why a replacement for torrents needs to start in the ecosystem
[14:35:40] <analoq> i think it's more likely those people want to protect their little bubble :P
[14:35:58] <analoq> because private trackers would cease to exist
[14:36:12] <NeoThermic> 1) get support for it in popular clients. 2) get support for it in popular tools (eg radarr/sonarr/lidarr), 3) get release groups to use it, 4) replace torrents over time
[14:36:30] <NeoThermic> release groups won't use it unless people can use it
[14:36:41] <NeoThermic> so you have to break that chicken and egg somewhere
[14:37:50] <NeoThermic> also a lot of things rely on the torrent ecosystem that are not easy to be visible
[14:38:13] <NeoThermic> eg, if you have a private torrent site that relies on ratios or something, then they're going to have a lot of custom code that speaks torrent
[14:38:30] <NeoThermic> getting them to replace that code (or add new code) to support a thing that their users arn't using is a non-starter
[14:38:40] <NeoThermic> this is what I mean about momentum
[14:39:25] <NeoThermic> torrents have all this infra around them and any replacement must replace it all, and there's so many places where people won't add support for replacement X because no one is using it, which is a catch22 that has to be broken somehow
[14:39:40] <NeoThermic> (see also why we still use things like IRC :D )
[14:39:46] <analoq> NeoThermic: idk. it didn't stop piracy via filehosters in the slightest.
[14:40:52] <NeoThermic> I mean, that point is unrelated to replacing torrents
[14:42:51] <analoq> well replacing was maybe the wrong phrasing. i rather meant, why aren't anon p2p solutions gaining significant marketshare
[14:43:28] <NeoThermic> because they're not supported in the ecosystem people operate torrents in
[14:44:02] <NeoThermic> if you gave me a privacy-centric torrent replacement to download right now
[14:44:09] <NeoThermic> would it work in my torrent client?
[14:44:17] <NeoThermic> how do I go about using it? does it have a magnet link?
[14:44:35] <NeoThermic> if the answer to all of these is "go set up a new bit of software" then you've lost :P
[14:44:57] <analoq> gnunet does as far as i can tell
[14:46:03] <NeoThermic> how about things like transmission or qBitorrent?
[14:46:05] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:46:10] <analoq> NeoThermic: i would agree that migration is difficult without a threat/ strong motivator. (e.g. trying to convince your peergroup to move to a different messenging app)
[14:46:55] <analoq> but here we have the looming threat of being sued (which happens a lot), which imho should be a strong motivator
[14:47:29] <NeoThermic> thing is, the RIAA/MPAA/BFI/etc have desensitised people on those threats
[14:47:46] <NeoThermic> ask anyone who got a letter from their ISP about torrenting if they stopped
[14:47:51] <NeoThermic> 90%+ probs didn't
[14:48:05] <NeoThermic> ask them if they changed torrent methods, I'd wager more than half didn't
[14:48:12] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (13203@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[14:48:21] <gmmi> I'd go even farther, probably 90+% didn't change the method either.
[14:48:25] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_​ö< FLAP FLAP​!
[14:48:30] <analoq> dunno here you get a pay xxxx EUR cease and desist letters right away
[14:48:30] <NeoThermic> ,bang
[14:48:30] <unfinity> NeoThermic you shot a duck in 5.494 seconds! You have killed 376 ducks in #datahoarder.
[14:48:38] <gmmi> I think we tend to vastly overestimate the technical proficiency of the average torrent user.
[14:48:43] <analoq> plus a potential house raid
[14:49:07] <NeoThermic> there's also what gmmi said. the average Joe learns how to torrent from a mate
[14:49:15] <NeoThermic> and won't change system unless mate does it for them
[14:49:51] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[14:49:54] <analoq> true it has to be easy to use
[14:50:44] <gmmi> More than that: It needs an existing userbase. It's the same issue I was facing when trying to convince my social circle to switch over to another messenger app. They won't switch because I tell them to, no matter how reasonable my arguments are.
[14:50:56] <gmmi> But if half of their mates are already using $app, they are more inclined to switch.
[14:51:05] <gmmi> .. which means that the odds are very much against GNUNet or other such projects.
[14:51:07] <NeoThermic> that's all about momentum again
[14:51:17] <analoq> it's just people drop huge amount of hours into developing 'something' hoping there is a userbase, and here i see a huge userbase and rarely anyone seems to touch it. It just feels odd? 
[14:52:14] <NeoThermic> also lets not forget the average user of torrents just wants to watch the thing they're downloading
[14:52:31] <NeoThermic> they'll hit up TPB or RARGB, find their thing, download it in a torrent client and be done
[14:53:48] <NeoThermic> or, in the case of one of my friends, they'll prod me for a magnet link :D
[14:54:10] <analoq> i get my linux images from mega most of the time
[14:55:25] <NeoThermic> mine are either direct downloads because I'm feeding them into proxmox or a torrent
[14:55:51] <NeoThermic> (that's assuming we're directly talking about actual linux images :D )
[14:56:03] <NeoThermic> here's a simple question
[14:56:10] <NeoThermic> for your torrent replacement thing
[14:56:17] <NeoThermic> is there a lib[torrent replacement thing]?
[14:56:34] <NeoThermic> (i.e. can I replace libtorrent with your thing?)
[14:57:44] <NeoThermic> if I were writing support for a new thing, I'd write a libNewThing, and a libNewThingForLibTorrent that provides a libtorrent-compatible API that maps to my libNewThing
[14:58:05] <NeoThermic> and then it'd be really easy to make builds of any software that uses libtorrent to use libNewThing
[14:58:16] <NeoThermic> and boom, I have the ability to foster a larger ecosystem than before
[15:06:54] <analoq> i would say the higher the motivator to switch is, the less important compatibility becomes. Maybe I am overestimating the legal threat for most of the userbase
[15:07:04] <analoq> or rather the 'perceived threat'
[15:09:36] <NeoThermic> I suspect you really are
[15:10:06] <NeoThermic> and people can't panic away from their current software to nothing, that just makes them stop doing it entirely 
[15:10:28] <NeoThermic> if people are to move away form torrents to a new thing, said new thing needs to have an ecosystem ready
