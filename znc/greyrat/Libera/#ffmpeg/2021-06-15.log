[01:09:45] <Polochon_street> hi! I'm making some software using ffmpeg as a lib, and I had a bug that only showed when I ran a specific song through my program. It's fixed now, but that would be nice to be able to add it to my test suite, and I can't (since the song is copyrighted) - how do you guys deal with these issues?
[01:10:38] <JEEB> samples generally are cut small enough that they clearly are samples.
[01:10:47] <JEEB> if you look at f.ex. the FATE sample suite
[01:11:11] <JEEB> I bet there's some copyrighted content in there, but it's generally cut to the absolute minimum
[01:11:26] <Polochon_street> I'm dealing with a 53 minutes mp3 audio that doesn't really like to be cut (if I cut it more to less than 50 minutes the bug doesn't appear anymore)
[01:11:38] <Polochon_street> I've tried with 53 minutes white noise, so I guess it's something inside that specific mp3
[01:12:20] <kepstin> depending on where you are, you might be able to argue fair use as a defence for a minimal example file (not a complete work) to use for testing. but something like that...
[01:12:41] <kepstin> might be best to try to figure out a synthetic example file that demonstrates the problem somehow :(
[01:12:56] <Polochon_street> yeah, I was just wondering how did you guys manage to isolate the problems usually
[01:13:02] <kepstin> but that would probably involve being deeply familiar with the mp3 format and maybe some hex editing
[01:13:26] <JEEB> well mp3 is just mpeg-1 layer 3 and then random metadata structures stuck before it
[01:13:46] <kepstin> mp3 is a really weird format, just a bunch of mpeg audio frames dumped into a file
[01:14:04] <kepstin> you can get really weird broken files sometimes, particularly if you concatenate multiple files
[01:14:14] <Polochon_street> I'm probably making the problem go away when I cut the audio file also
[01:14:31] <JEEB> Polochon_street: if it has been fixed in master or whatever, attempt to figure out which commit fixed it?
[01:14:32] *** Joins: s55 (~s55@user/s55)
[01:14:41] <JEEB> then try to replicate the faulty behavior by what triggers that code
[01:14:46] <kepstin> i assume the issue probably happens in your example with a particular broken frame at one spot in the file, or possibly a bad concatenation point.
[01:15:11] <Polochon_street> I just fixed the code myself, it was in the way I was handling frames (or, what the rust bindings were doing with that)
[01:15:37] <JEEB> ok, I assumed it was an FFmpeg issue if you commented here but oK
[01:15:48] <Polochon_street> I made sure I was in user :p
[01:16:08] <Polochon_street> but was wondering how you guys did it, since it's fairly similar to what you would do
[01:16:20] <Polochon_street> (I guess)
[01:16:39] <JEEB> yea for me it's less about copyrighted stuff and more the fact that the test suite is supposed to be minimal entries only
[01:16:44] <JEEB> which is why we still don't have 22.2 AAC sample
[01:16:46] <kepstin> yeah, the trick would be finding the particular spot in the file that causes the issue, and trimming off the start as well as the end to narrow it down.
[01:16:48] <JEEB> since I'm a lazy git
[01:16:57] <JEEB> to cut a minimal sample that contains all channels
[01:17:00] <Polochon_street> :D
[01:17:31] <Polochon_street> I'll try to print out which frame failed / if it's actually always the same that fails
[01:17:43] <JEEB> but really, I'd say that if it's specifically a test suite then just utilize the minimum required for that replication
[01:17:44] <Polochon_street> it's a segfault, so of course it can potentially magically disappear
[01:17:53] <kepstin> mp3's one of those fun formats where you can just chop off the start of a file and it's still valid
[01:18:16] <kepstin> (preferably you should align to a frame start when chopping of course)
[01:18:48] <Polochon_street> good to know :D
[01:19:04] <Polochon_street> thanks for the ideas, I'll try to narrow it
[01:19:15] <kepstin> i guess you could lose your xing header if you had one tho, and that can potentially change behaviour of this sort of thing.
[01:19:54] <JEEB> but yea back when I was maintaining some other things I had a public sample suite, as well as some I didn't upload since they were full media files
[01:20:07] <JEEB> where possible I'd just cut things so that they'd fit into the public one
[01:20:56] <JEEB> I think the fun bit with FFmpeg is that there's a large set of samples which are actually uploaded to places
[01:21:02] <JEEB> like the mpeg-2 video matrixtest sample
[01:21:08] <JEEB> and that are expected to be tested with
[01:21:13] <JEEB> but because of their size they're not part of FATE

[02:19:43] <bencc1__> DTX save bandwidth if the user isn't speaking and I wonder if it can result with gaps

[02:25:43] <furq> it probably just gets decoded as empty frames
[02:25:58] <furq> the libspeex stuff supports dtx though
[02:26:15] <furq> or not empty, silent
[02:32:08] <kepstin> iirc in opus you're supposed to use send empty frames to the decoder to fill in the gaps, which triggers error correction/concealment if available and ensures it generates a continuous stream of decoded audio without gaps.

[05:24:14] <Tosin> Hi all, so I'm a developer working on a program using FFMPEG in C++ and was wondering how to run an existing filter in it. The filter I'm trying to work with is silencedetect. I've already set up my environment to be able to run all the libraries included from FFMPEG and already ran some of the examples to see that it works.
[05:24:56] <Tosin> I am kinda confused on what it is I need to include in my main function to return the string output that silencedetect returns when running the executable file
[05:25:09] <Tosin> https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavfilter/af_silencedetect.c
[05:25:52] <Tosin> I've looked through it's source code here but still unsure of what parameters or even functions I need to call in main in order to do this and was wondering if anyone knew how it works or the things I should be looking for.

[05:28:00] <Tosin> If anyone is unfamiliar this is an example of the output when running the command, ffmpeg -i input.wav -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=3 -f null -
[05:28:33] <Tosin> And essentially I am trying to store the string it outputs into a data structure in my C++ code

[05:30:04] <furq> you should probably get the values from metadata though
[05:30:23] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:31:45] <Tosin> By values, do you mean the silence_start and end_end times or the entire string? furq
[05:33:27] <furq> the string is what you'd get from av_log which you'd then have to parse
[05:33:36] <Tosin> Okay
[05:33:37] <furq> but silencedetect tags the start and end frames of the detected silence with metadata
[05:34:40] <Tosin> Okay, as I'm looking at silencedetect.c, I'm just confused what functions in it I need to call in order to even produce what those start and end times are
[05:34:41] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:34:48] <Tosin> Do you think you could give it a look?
[05:36:03] <furq> you don't directly call functions from within filters

[13:00:11] <Tosin> Anyone have any thoughts on my issue?
[13:00:58] <JEEB> I'd almost be lazy and utilize av_bprint for dynamically built strings
[13:01:12] <JEEB> if you're already utilizing FFmpeg libs
[13:01:35] <JEEB> #include <libavutil/bprint.h>
[13:02:01] <JEEB> then you can just AVBprint buf = { 0 }; av_bprint_init(&buf, 0, AV_BPRINT_SIZE_UNLIMITED);
[13:02:07] <JEEB> that initializes an AVBprint
[13:02:48] <JEEB> then you can do stuff like av_bprintf(&buf, "d=%"PRId64"", 30000);
[13:02:54] <lilibox> furq: there is no needed special settings? just ffmpeg -i aaaa.dss output.mp3 ?
[13:03:13] <JEEB> then you check with av_bprint_is_complete(&buf) if the buffer was complete
[13:03:23] *** Joins: pong (~loop@user/pong)
[13:03:30] <JEEB> if it was successfully complete, then you can utilize buf.str
[13:03:37] <JEEB> which is the generated string
[13:04:01] <JEEB> and then av_bprint_finalize(&buf, NULL); after you've finished with the string
[13:04:23] <Tosin> I'm starting to think I may be wrong
[13:04:45] <Tosin> I may have to use int64_t
[13:05:08] <Tosin> I'm just not sure why it isn't working
[13:05:10] <JEEB> but I think your underlying problem is that you wantaed to do "d=%"PRId64"" in the format string :P (that is the format string for int64_t
[13:05:26] <JEEB> but if you are so unsure with snprintf
[13:05:32] <JEEB> I recommend you just utilize AVBprint
[13:05:37] <Tosin> Okay

[13:05:45] <JEEB> that is a simpler'ish string API :P
[13:05:55] <JEEB> you can basically keep printing into that buffer

[13:10:50] <Tosin> You might be right, but I know I'll be able to accomplish it
[13:11:04] <JEEB> I'm not sure how crappy it is, but there is doc/examples/filtering_audio.c in current master
[13:11:12] <JEEB> which sounds like what you're trying to do
[13:11:20] <JEEB> if you just want the output audio there
[13:11:31] <Tosin> That's what I've been using all night lol, but I'll reference it again

[18:32:46] <Enverex> So when examining a media file, ffmpeg will list out the different streams like:

[18:34:58] <Enverex> But if you actually want to use any of these in ffmpeg, e.g. for mapping, you have to reference them in a different numeric system. So in this example, if I wanted to use "Stream #0:7(eng): Audio" in a mapper, it would actually be 0:a:3. Is there any way of using the #0:7 reference instead? As I don't see a way of using the output programmatically

[20:19:05] <p9> i have a wav file with pcm_f32le samples which I want to split (by cuesheet) but the tool I use (shntool) complains about this sample format. i thought i could change format with ffmpeg first. is there a quality loss when converting between float and integer sample formats?

[20:26:02] <ossifrage> I'm looking to be able to decode and scale ~16 1080p streams and display them on a 4k display
[20:26:17] <klaxa> sounds like you want more than one soc
[20:27:05] <ossifrage> klaxa, it can be done with some of the hisilicon parts, but they aren't popular as linux single board computers
[20:27:08] <klaxa> p9: you could resample a short part and compare how they sound

[23:36:29] <BtbN> What do you mean?
[23:36:49] <JEEB> you receive AVFrames, check the metadata attached to those
[23:37:22] <Tosin> I think that's exactly what I need to do JEEB
[23:37:48] <Tosin> I saw something on stackoverflow about that same thing and using av_dict_get() to get the outputs
[23:38:01] <Tosin> But I'm unsure what function to use with AVFrames
[23:38:17] <Tosin> I'll share the code that I have so far
[23:38:20] <JEEB> https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/structAVFrame.html
[23:38:33] <JEEB> see an entry in AVFrames called metadata
[23:38:38] <JEEB> and its type
[23:39:03] <JEEB> that's the old way, and in various newer things you instead get side_data which is actually a string and not random strings :)
[23:39:13] <JEEB> but it seems like silencedetect which you are utilizing adds metadata keys
[23:41:00] <Tosin> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ba4a74a9e6ba0af2718348f02e480a13/image.png
[23:41:08] <Tosin> Okay, so this is what I have so far
[23:41:45] <Tosin> On like 87 you can see that I've declared the AVFrame structure, but now my goal is pass the intervals found from silencedetect into it
[23:41:50] <Tosin> How do I go about doing that?
[23:42:43] <Tosin> This is the source to af_silencedetect.c https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavfilter/af_silencedetect.c
[23:43:13] <Tosin> Is the goal I'm trying to achieve clear?

[23:44:44] <JEEB> you don't need to start allocating avframes where you create the filter chain
[23:44:55] <JEEB> you feed stuff into a filter (from f.ex. an audio decoder)
[23:45:02] <JEEB> and you receive back AVFrames from it
[23:45:19] *** Joins: mega (~iglosiggi@129-73-17-190.fibertel.com.ar)
[23:46:32] <JEEB> the frames received from the filter chain will then be the ones with the metadata

[23:48:19] <Tosin> The filter is being created on line 101
[23:52:13] <Tosin> Or, do you happen to know where the AVFrames are being received in my code?
[23:52:30] <Tosin> Or do I need to still implement that
[23:52:56] *** Joins: a0z (~a0z@90.244.140.171)
[23:53:53] <JEEB> av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags for feeding into a buffersrc

[23:58:05] <Tosin> Oh I think I know what you mean
[23:58:36] <Tosin> One second, so the source is where it goes into and the sink is what I can use to output the data from it I'm assuming
