[00:14:26] <artao> i can throat sing, but DAMN!! not that well
[00:14:38] <artao> ... of course, how much is it enhanced in mixing

[00:15:24] <artao> louipc you're familiar with the TB-303 tho, yes?
[00:16:02] <enoq> the esoteric channels on youtube seem to hold some form of stranglehold on that kind of music
[00:16:19] <louipc> artao: no
[00:16:32] <artao> :O
[00:16:35] <artao> not into synths?
[00:17:09] <louipc> i dont know nothin bout synths
[00:17:17] <artao> the Roland TB-303 is from the early 80s. Very cheap simple single oscillator unit Roland meant to be used for practice, as the bassline
[00:17:22] <artao> didn't go over well
[00:17:34] <artao> electronic musicians then bought them SUPER cheap from pawn shops and the like
[00:17:54] <artao> as such, it became The Sound of electronic music. That squelchy filter is iconic
[00:18:13] <artao> nothing special about the oscillator. it's all about the filter. ... and the sequencer with its slide and accent
[00:18:37] <artao> hugely influential instrument
[00:18:51] <artao> tho cheap in the 80s, originals now go for over 1000 bucks
[00:19:09] <artao> you can get remakes/clones tho. Behringer has a very good one for 150usd
[00:19:28] <artao> which i've repeatedly considered buying. but it's a one trick pony. wouldn't get a whole lot of use

[00:35:35] <artao> no ... well ..... not with "room treatment"
[00:35:41] <artao> however, it is SUPER dead
[00:35:58] <artao> the speakers are pointed directly at where i sit, which is a futon. and behind me is bookshelves
[00:36:13] <artao> so "naturally" sound absorbant and dispersive
[00:36:22] <artao> no need to treat the room 
[00:36:32] <novns> you can measure the room

[04:52:29] <louipc> yea thats what it must be
[04:52:39] <louipc> just seems strange to play the whole set with it attached
[04:52:55] <artao> also, ice cream was on sale. i got a tub of banana split ice cream. mmmmm
[04:53:22] <artao> it could also have to do with the wireless setup
[04:54:00] <artao> the engineer needs to bring that guitar level down. jeez!

[04:56:26] <murthy> artao: That AI  drawing demo is very impressive
[04:56:28] <artao> hm. interesting
[04:57:47] <murthy> It seems Roland synth are good with the synthetic sounds 
[04:57:50] <murthy> hype: Good morning
[04:58:08] <murthy> Yamaha syth is very good with traditional pianos
[04:58:22] <louipc> murthy: thats ridiculous
[04:58:24] <artao> ya
[04:58:34] <murthy> louipc: which?

[04:58:40] <artao> they used to make damn-fine analog gear too

[05:00:19] <murthy> artao: This is just a proof of concept and the tech is at early stages, imaging the version after 50 years
[05:00:24] <murthy> imagine
[05:00:50] <murthy> I first came to know about that tech with the faceapp

[05:01:43] <murthy> Its very for a kid
[05:01:43] <artao> nice
[05:02:11] <murthy> Its a very nice keyboard for a kid
[05:02:24] <louipc> kool
[05:02:29] <murthy> I really like the Yamaha montage 8
[05:02:35] <murthy> Its not available in India it seems
[05:03:03] <murthy> other synths sounds like toy pianos :( very sorry
[05:04:36] <murthy> Do anyone of you know any synth better than Yamaha montage 8? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=304NmznmlIo
[05:04:40] <Janet> ^ Yamaha Montage [Demo] | No Talking | - YouTube
[05:04:51] <murthy> I mean in terms of sounds
[05:04:55] <murthy> not features
[05:05:40] <artao> "better" is subjective
[05:05:58] <artao> korg totally makes equivalent, and prolly casio
[05:06:24] <murthy> I thought the kid was going to take away the sleep of my sister and my brother-in-law but it seems that Casio keyboard volume goes all the way to 0 and also it has a 3.5mm headphone jack

[05:13:23] <artao> sure
[05:13:41] <louipc> dam i wanna dance with a coffin on my shoulder
[05:13:42] <murthy> ty
[05:13:46] <artao> the keyboard is an Arturia MiniLab, first version
[05:13:48] <murthy> :D
[05:14:11] <murthy> artao: oh ya I remember now
[05:14:19] <artao> the mixer is a Behringer Xenyx 1002B, audio interface is Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 2nd gen
[05:14:26] <murthy> You like those Arturias
[05:15:02] <artao> synths are: Korg Volca Sample (1st version), Korg NuTekt NTS-1, Modal CraftSynth, Behringer Neutron, and Roland System 1M
[05:15:18] <artao> then there's the little black box with knobs which is a Korg SQ-1 sequencer
[05:15:40] <artao> i also have an Arturia KeyStep Pro and Arturia Spark CDM hybrid drum machine controller
[05:15:44] <artao> not in the picture
[05:15:49] <artao> wait no
[05:16:21] <artao> AH it is
[05:16:33] <artao> murthy the short white keyboard is the MiniLab
[05:16:42] <artao> the long one is the Arturia KeyStep Pro
[05:17:09] <murthy> I think Prints also has one of MiniLab
[05:17:17] <artao> it's a nice unit
[05:17:19] <murthy> I guess Arturia is a nice brand
[05:17:24] <artao> they are
[05:17:24] <murthy> nice
[05:17:34] <artao> i didn't intend to have so much Arturia stuff. it just ended up that way
[05:17:41] <artao> most of my software synths are arturia too LOL
[05:17:48] <artao> arturia and native instruments
[05:18:15] <murthy> oh ya I now remember Arturia's midi controller is a direct competitor of Akai's 
[05:18:34] <artao> ah
[05:18:41] <artao> i went with the minilab cuz of all the knobs
[05:19:01] <murthy> artao: do these hi end synths have a midi out?

[23:36:34] <morlog> I have to go to the bank and I don't want to
[23:36:41] <artao> Tip: If you like salmon .... Add a 1/2 can of salmon to a pound of hamburger when making hamburgers
[23:36:57] <artao> plus one med. egg and a sprinkling of flour
[23:37:10] <morlog> also good if you don't like your guests
[23:37:18] <LibertyDillo> lol
[23:37:21] <artao> makes awesomely moist burgers
[23:37:27] <morlog> moist
[23:37:49] <LibertyDillo> "You didn't use canned salmon, did you?"
[23:37:50] <artao> the flour helps seal the outside of the burger, trapping the moisture inside it
[23:38:02] <artao> and the salmon just extends it and adds healthfulness
[23:38:20] <artao> too much salmon ruins it tho. it falls apart when cooking
[23:38:33] <artao> the egg acts as a binder ... plus the flour helps that too
[23:39:11] <artao> and, of course, add seasonings to taste. i like to use salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder
[23:39:16] <artao> perhaps some thyme if i have some
[23:39:23] <artao> and/or rosemary
[23:39:27] <morf> how about some alcohol
