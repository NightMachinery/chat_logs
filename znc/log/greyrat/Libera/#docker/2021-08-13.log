[00:40:59] <moldorcoder7> hi percona has those 2 command to create their container : docker create --volume /srv --name pmm-data percona/pmm-server:2 /bin/true; docker run --detach --restart always --publish 443:443 --volumes-from pmm-data --name pmm-server percona/pmm-server:2
[00:41:13] <moldorcoder7> what is the purpose of the --volume-from ?
[00:42:00] <moldorcoder7> if i do -v /mypath/srv iot doesnt work
[00:42:10] <moldorcoder7> container complains abbout missing files ...

[00:49:20] <programmerq> moldorcoder7▸ that's a very old pattern called a "data container". Basically, before you could name a volume, you'd create a dummy container with the anonymous volumes and then you could refer to that dummy container or data container by its name.
[00:49:28] <programmerq> just use named volumes now
[00:50:02] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, ok i know the later
[00:50:12] <programmerq> so instead of "docker create -v /srv --name foo image && docker run --volumes-from foo ..." you would do: "docker run -v myservice_srv:/srv ..."
[00:51:18] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, that doesnt work , cause  on the image/cinbtainer itself there is data in /srv that are not present when doing the later
[00:51:44] <moldorcoder7> guess i would have to copy them from the image and copy them first in the named / bind volume
[00:51:49] <moldorcoder7> programmerq, thanks i got the idea
[00:52:19] <ada_> moldorcoder7: if you create an empty volume, docker will automatically copy the content from the container /srv into the volume when you start the container the first time
[00:53:03] <moldorcoder7> ada_, ok thanks , that wont work with bind volume right ?
[00:53:10] <tabakhase> prog can you date that? :D 
[00:53:11] <moldorcoder7> i mean it doesnt work here for sure :)
[00:53:18] <ada_> moldorcoder7: no, it doesn't work with bind mounts
[00:53:21] <ada_> moldorcoder7: only named volumes
[00:53:36] <moldorcoder7> ok thanks for help

[16:25:20] <faceface> I don't get why both boxes are on the same network, but apparently can't see each other... are services configured in the compose file isolated by default?
[16:26:32] <selckin> well if you pass --network to docker run to make it work, you'll have to configure the same things in the compose file
[16:27:15] <faceface> selckin: OK, it's just that when I use compose to start up all 3 services, and then use netshoot --network, I can 'see' them all
[16:27:23] <faceface> they just apparently can't see each other
[16:27:51] <faceface> thansk for that page... do I need to pay attention to 'driver: custom-driver-1'?
[16:28:40] <selckin> by default in the same compose file can see each other, if you want them to access a docker outside of that, you'll need to create a network, and have the compose ones and the external one join it

[23:06:26] <Lutin> ada_ I can't have a docker container bind on all local IP's as it seems to do... ike when you run systemd-rolve on 127.0.0.53 (port 53) and you want to map the port 53 of a cotainer on that same host... and I don't want to set the public IP where I want to bind to in my docker-compose
[23:06:30] <ada_> Lutin: you can bind a port to a specific IP, docker run --port 10.0.0.1:80:80  would bind to my host IP 10.0.0.1 and not 0.0.0.0
[23:06:52] <Lutin> ada_ yap... want to avoid that :D
[23:09:18] <ada_> can you give me a functional example of what you want to do
[23:11:30] <Lutin> ada_ bind port 53 on a docker host that also has systemd-resolve running on 53
[23:12:20] <ada_> bind them both to different IPs
[23:13:30] <ada_> your question, rewritten:  how do I run two services bound to the same port?  and the answer is, bind them to different IPs and don't use the catch-all 0.0.0.0
[23:13:34] <Lutin> yes but it's less flexible in my deployment
[23:13:49] <ada_> docker isn't going to provide a magical solution for that
[23:15:03] <Lutin> I know but I wonder what defaults I could use which I simply can copy over to like 100+ nodes :)
[23:15:28] <Lutin> I think I need to ditch systemd-resolve or try to modify it my way
[23:15:51] <Lutin> by defaut docker maps on all IP's as I see it or not 
[23:16:17] <ada_> so I think you should explain your whole use case
[23:17:00] <ada_> because at first you said "I want to run two processes on the same port" but now it's "I want to provide DNS services to 100+ hosts"
[23:17:10] <Lutin> nothing more then I explained actually... I don't want to bind on my public IP but I have probems with 53 running on 127.0.0.53
[23:17:33] <Lutin> no I don't want to run it... the defaut is there already runs one on ubuntu
[23:17:50] <ada_> so confused
[23:17:58] <Lutin> so I need to find workaround for not mapping to my public IP for my DNS container
[23:18:08] <ada_> put a private IP on your nic ...
[23:18:29] <Lutin> how would that help?
[23:18:36] <ada_> i mean, i'm not sure what to tell you to do because I don't understand the USE CASE
[23:18:46] <ada_> you just said "I don't want X" and my suggestion is "Use Y"
[23:18:52] <Lutin> I need to see, can't I bind a container to an interface ?
[23:19:01] <ada_> I told you you can bind a container to a specific IP
[23:19:16] <Lutin> yes but i don't want to set the IP in my compose

[23:19:37] <ada_> ok well you have to make a decision
[23:19:54] <ada_> maybe your Reasons are bad reasons?
[23:19:56] <ada_> idk
[23:19:58] <Lutin> I know, why is IT sometimes like women ?
[23:20:05] <ada_> careful
[23:20:18] <Lutin> ada_ not really bad... call them "lazy"... or native
[23:20:54] <Lutin> ada_ I'm always careful with women, no worries... they parents always asked me to pic them up where ever they were :)
[23:21:18] <Lutin> ada_ I mean... you know how men in IT can be ;)
[23:21:30] <Lutin> yu are experiencing it right now :)
[23:22:43] <Lutin> would be nice if docker-compose.yml would accept some bash or whatever to get the IP from an interface

[23:27:07] <ada_> Lutin: compose can read from environment variables
[23:27:22] <Lutin> ada_ that is a great idea indeed!
[23:27:22] <ada_> Lutin: you could wrap compose ina script to read the IPs off that interface, set a var, and then expand it in compose
