Any ideas as to why? I am using a USB plug and play microphone and using alsa as the input muxer for the audio if that helps. Thanks

[08:05:06] <jethro3> Hello guys. Usually when compiling a package from source, do "configure" and "make" do any modifications outside of the working directory? I know that "make install" copies the binaries outside, but if I just do "configure" and "make" without the latter, can I make sure that no modifications have been done outside, or is that not a given?
[08:05:11] <ayecee> is jensen "bloated" in any sense? i think most people would agree that jenson is kind of fragile and maintained by one person.
[08:05:41] <jensen> how the hell you spell my name differently the second time
[08:05:52] <kfrench> jethro3: Generally, you'd run make as a non-root user so that changes won't happen to the system.

[08:06:36] <ayecee> carelessness, mostly
[08:06:55] <jethro3> if I understand correctly, configure checks the system if the dependencies are available, make compiles the source to binary, and make install copies the binaries to their correspondir directories, is that correct?
[08:07:10] *** Quits: CEP (~CEP@user/cep) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:07:12] <jethro3> corresponding*
[08:07:21] <kfrench> jethro3: configure could make supporting files that are needed for make.  But yes, that's generally correct.
[08:07:32] *** Quits: peetaur (~peter@204.237.88.161) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[08:08:21] <jethro3> in the case that configure would need to make supporting files, it would make them inside the working directory or system-wise (needing to run sudo?) or that depends on the program?
[08:08:30] *** Joins: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)
[08:08:34] <kfrench> yes
[08:09:31] *** Quits: Kilroy (Kilroy@user/Kilroy) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:09:54] <kfrench> Sorry.  That wasn't a yes/no question.  Yes, it would normally create those files within the current directory.
[08:10:15] <kfrench> Not compiling as root limits the possibilities.
[08:11:28] <jethro3> Alright. Thanks for clarifying and answering my questions
[08:16:50] <jethro3> I'm currently running debian stable, but at times I need programs that are not available in the repo. I tried flatpaks but I didn't like the fact that I had to install a separate program to run my programs ("flatpak appname") and that the downloads were huge due to redundant dependencies.
[08:16:50] <jethro3> What I'm doing instead is compiling from source and placing the binaries in ~/.local/bin.
[08:16:51] <jethro3> Are there also more options that I'm not aware of is that usually the approach?
[08:17:25] <jethro3> (besides the unsafe ways of adding third party repos or installing .deb files)
[08:18:18] *** Joins: Kilroy (Kilroy@user/Kilroy)
[08:18:34] <kfrench> You could download the source debs, review the contents and gain trust in it.  e.g. you can verify the source code bundle is from the originating author.
[08:19:21] <kfrench> If you end up trusting the source deb, you could rebuild the deb and then install the resulting deb.

[15:01:25] <Kremator> good night/morning folks, question: i do want to carry daily and usb with a live linux distro specially for cases such as "friend's PC is not working" so i can use it to debug, but also i would like it to have some "isolated" enviroment when lent/borrowed a laptop, which distro would fit the best those use cases? be aware that i want it to be "persistant" so i can install some extra tools as i will be needing it trough the time

[18:01:37] <luva> Hello, I am trying to configure my dns setup but I am struggling since there are so many different configs or whatever involved. I am running ubuntu 20.04 on a server. I am using systemd-resolve I think. ( /etc/resolv.conf is linked to /run/resolve/resolv.conf) and the stublistener is off. I have setup resolved.conf in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
[18:01:38] <luva> with following: [Resolve] DNS=127.0.0.1 DNSStubListener=no.
[18:01:38] <luva> But my eth0 interface always gets some DNS servers through DHCP. I cannot get rid of it somehow, can someone help me?=

[20:37:56] <SpeakerToMeat> Hey.
[20:38:47] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, can I expect mounts in fstab to be handled in order? even with systemd? because I want to mount a disk and then bind mount a dir from there somewhere else... maybe I should use systemd mounts and the dependency graph instead?

[21:23:17] <katp32> heyo, I've got a mystery for y'all. my Intel Wireless-AC 9260 card causes hard resets at random intervals (sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes several days). the resets only happen while the card is under load, ie, just having the firmware+driver loaded will never cause a reset. by "hard reset" I mean the system instantly goes back to BIOS. there are no relevant kernel messages. a different machine with an
[21:23:23] <katp32> Intel Wireless-AC 9260 card, using the exact same kernel and firmware, doesn't have this issue, which means the issue has something to do with the hardware configuration of this specific machine. it's been suggested that the problem could be caused by a fuse tripping, which could mean there's a hardware issue with the card, although it could also potentially mean that the card is intentionally drawing more
[21:23:28] <Voidling> take system boot & the works, whole nine yards
[21:23:29] <katp32> power via PCIe than it's allowed to; I'm not a hardware expert. the other suggestion I've received is that the instant reset is indicative of a triple fault, which would mean it's a firmware/driver issue, in which case it should be fixable (or at least reportable to the people who can fix it). I would be *incredibly* appreciative of any other thoughts, even if it's not a solution in of itself

[23:20:01] <phogg> hacknorris: when munging text you really need to actually reverse
[23:20:24] <hacknorris> ah, i didnt joined when was question o.O
[23:20:26] <phogg> programmatically reverse would be to swap the order of the bytes (or the bits, depending on who you ask)
[23:20:33] *** Quits: darutoko (~darutoko@37.21.218.154) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:20:36] <phogg> which is not a helpful exercise, you need the output to make sense as a string
[23:21:06] <hacknorris> ah, this. i thought that programmatically is to reverse order and visually to see it reversed
[23:21:06] <msiism> Like, e.g., xinU ton s'UNG.
[23:21:17] <hacknorris> text good tho
[23:21:23] <hacknorris> kknown
[23:21:26] <phogg> msiism: you cannot pass NUL to tac -s, the closest you get in shell is -s '' (which is not supported)
[23:21:41] <msiism> It's all a tragedy.
[23:21:49] <phogg> hacknorris: I take visually to mean "make it appear as a human would expect" when reversed
[23:21:50] <hacknorris> imma head out
[23:21:55] *** Joins: Visne (~Visne@dhcp-077-248-174-092.chello.nl)

[23:23:37] <phogg> since the proposed solution is to refactor tac.c into a shared library, add support for -n to that, and call it when tail -r is called
