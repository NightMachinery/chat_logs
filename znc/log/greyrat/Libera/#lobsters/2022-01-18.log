[19:11:51] <ngoldbaum> “The default of 7 comes from fairly early in git development, when seven hex digits was a lot (it covers about 250+ million hash values). Back then I thought that 65k revisions was a lot (it was what we were about to hit in BK), and each revision tends to be about 5-10 new objects or so, so a million objects was a big number.”
