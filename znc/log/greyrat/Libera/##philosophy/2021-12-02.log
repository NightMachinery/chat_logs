[13:51:32] <arryana> i was just ordering our christmas crap.
[13:52:13] <arryana> last year this time, we were about to move house.  i don't think we were here a week and a half before christmas, so decorating was more no than yes.
[13:53:09] <pussipupu> Our new cooker gets installed Sunday and then I'm going to experiment with pasties, and maybe sell some at the local farmer's market
[13:53:36] <pussipupu> oh yeah, probably time to find the decorations box
[13:53:38] <arryana> ooooh
[13:53:45] <arryana> that's brilliant
[13:54:25] <arryana> this house is bigger than our last place, and we've never had a full size tree, so it seemed like a good time to splash out a little.
[13:55:09] <arryana> i may have gotten a bit crazy, but it can all go from year to year.

[19:42:42] <audrey> Hah! Didn´t know you were a Robin Hanson reader.
[19:42:47] <audrey> I met him at a social occasion a few years ago.
[19:42:59] <audrey> Rather an eccentric man.

[19:43:28] <causative> he has a lot to say on the subject of how social norms and status-seeking are at odds with the rational pursuit of truth
[19:44:39] <audrey> Sure. I don´t suppose most people are all that interested in the rational pursuit of truth, though.

[19:47:39] <audrey> Bryan Caplan (an old colleague of Hanson, as I recall?) has spoken a lot about «rational ignorance».
[19:48:06] <audrey> That is, given the time and effort constraints it would take to acquire certain kinds of information, it is actually more rational to remain ignorant and spend that time and effort on other things.
[19:48:21] <causative> it can be, sure, but that's not the problem Hanson is concerned with
[19:48:25] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[19:48:42] <causative> he's concerned with people actively spending huge amounts of time and effort at *cross-purposes* to the truth
[19:48:44] <audrey> Perhaps most of the arcane «meaning of life» type questions that philosophers tend to be obsessed with, fall into this category.
[19:49:11] <audrey> Well, I don´t think «truth» has some inherent axiological weight.
[19:49:50] <causative> as I said, when people act based on falsehoods, they act against their own interests
[19:49:54] <red_owl> act against their own interests? or not against others interests?
[19:49:57] <causative> you can't make informed choices without the truth
[19:50:01] <audrey> But I tend toward axiological nihilism anyway so I might not be the best person to poll.
[19:50:21] <audrey> «In the long run, we´re all dead» -Keynes
[19:50:30] <causative> this is very close to the meaning of truth - truth is information that, when acted upon, leads you to actions that serve your interests
[19:50:43] <red_owl> no thats pragmatism
[19:50:46] <causative> I won't say that's the final definition of truth but it has a lot to do with it
[19:50:49] <audrey> causative: That is a *highly* controversial definition of truth.
[19:51:00] <audrey> I would definitely not pose that definition as though it were widely accepted.
[19:51:08] <causative> and I did not
[19:51:55] <causative> to deceive someone is to enslave them - to chain their actions via their mind
[19:52:05] <red_owl> i think the word "facts" in your sentence would fit better than truth
[19:52:48] <audrey> Mmm, alternative facts.
[19:52:52] <causative> deception robs the subject of his autonomy
[19:52:54] <red_owl> facts are information that, when acted (or agreed) upon, lead to...
[19:53:00] <audrey> I think I´m going to cook some alternative facts for breakfast
[19:53:08] <causative> autonomy being the capability to make informed choices with the power to carry them out
[19:53:12] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[19:54:24] <pussipupu> Cook a fry-up instead
[19:54:25] <pussipupu> or porridge
[19:55:14] <causative> we can only be our true selves when we are acting on true information
[19:55:27] <audrey> I´m not convinced there is such a thing as a  «true self»
[19:55:34] <audrey> Just various selves, in whatever states they happen to be in
[19:55:48] <causative> if you act on a falsehood, and then later realize it, you will look back on your actions and say it wasn't your fault, you were misinformed - and perhaps you'd be right
[19:56:07] <causative> it wasn't your fault because you didn't truly have agency, as you were deceived
[19:56:32] <audrey> Will I? IDK.
[19:56:35] <causative> although this does depend on whether you had a duty capability to know the truth
[19:56:39] <causative> *duty and capability
[19:56:56] * arryana wonders what sauce goes best on alternative facts
[19:57:06] <causative> if you did, and you chose not to find out the truth, then your actions on false information could still be your fault
[19:57:11] <audrey> I´ve done some pretty stupid things in my life, sometimes out of ignorance. When I look back on those times of my life I don´t think «It wasn´t my fault! I was ignorant!»
[19:57:26] <audrey> Seems like a pretty feelgood/self-serving way to think about past mistakes, tbh.
[19:57:32] <biys> hah
[19:57:39] <causative> it's also a compassionate way to think about the mistakes of others
[19:57:40] <audrey> arryana: Barbecue sauce in the same color as Giuliani´s runny hair dye.
[19:57:47] <arryana> haha
[19:57:57] <arryana> i was thinking bearnaise, you can really taste the bear.
[19:58:05] <audrey> Reminds me, I need to dye my hair sometime
[19:58:10] <biys> it's kind of sketch though, cause it kind of suggests that there is a more or less admirable way to live within the world.  show me your contract with the universe.
[19:58:12] <audrey> At this rate I´ll be going gray in a few years.
[19:58:14] <causative> if you understand that people behave wrongly because they were deceived, you have no need to get angry at them and blame them - you understand they were chained by ignorance
[19:58:20] <biys> to suggest that anyone is _supposed_ to live in any one way or another is mad
[19:58:21] <arryana> what color?
[19:58:38] <causative> biys, everyone, including you, has preferences about how the world should be
[19:58:39] <arryana> i started greying at 17, but i rather like it.
[19:58:41] <audrey> arryana: Thinking of a subdued ginger or something, but I worry even that will be too blatant
[19:58:43] <biys> essentially your entire understanding of the world around you is as ar esult of some for of indoctration or another
[19:58:47] <biys> it's not organic in any sense
[19:58:47] <arryana> not that i'm wearing it grey at the moment
[19:58:48] <arryana> oooh
[19:58:53] <arryana> what's wrong with blatant?
[19:58:54] <biys> :S/for/form/
[19:58:58] <arryana> you're pretty, you can pull it off
[19:59:03] <causative> biys, and these preferences that you have include how people should live in that world, including how you yourself should live
[19:59:07] <audrey> I mean, I don´t want to come across like I´m trying too hard
[19:59:12] * arryana shrugs
[19:59:13] <biys> my _preferences_ aren't necessarily _my preferences_
[19:59:17] <biys> they're just the options i've been provided
[19:59:18] <arryana> hair color is fun
[19:59:35] <causative> I don't see what you intended to mean by underlining the words differently
[19:59:36] <biys> this is talked about at length in mr.robot
[19:59:51] <causative> you do have preferences, and they are your preferences
[19:59:55] <causative> A=A
[20:00:13] <causative> axiom of identity
[20:00:21] <arryana> but you're not wrong that people will judge, i just don't give a fuck what most people think
[20:00:28] <biys> my preferences are still uh...  my preferences still operate within the confines of what's considered erasonable preferenecs
[20:00:30] <audrey> Well, redheads in particular have a certain reputation
[20:00:32] <biys> as determined by the construct
[20:00:40] <causative> sure
[20:00:42] <audrey> I mean I´m too old for that nonsense, but I don´t really want to single myself out for attention
[20:00:43] * arryana giggles, currently wearing bright red hair
[20:00:51] <causative> there's all sorts of deterministic reasons why you hold your preferences biys
[20:00:54] <audrey> arryana: Classy! :)
[20:00:56] <arryana> i'm a lot older than you are, and i still wear flaming red.
[20:00:58] <causative> but they remain your preferences
[20:01:11] <audrey> arryana: I aspire to the aura of don´t-give-a-damn that you exude
[20:01:18] <arryana> if someone wants to be age-ist, it's their ignorance
[20:01:22] <arryana> well
[20:01:30] <biys> i disagree.  i think they're simply the selection of a particlular option.  there very well could be a more preferable option i'm not aware of
[20:01:33] <arryana> i can tell you how i got this way, and it was advice from my father when i was very young.
[20:02:02] <causative> biys, to say that is to assume that some options are "more preferable" or "less preferable" - you are assuming the point which you are trying to refute
[20:02:05] <biys> or i could be making the deciion based entirely on a mattter of _reaction_ and not necessarily have really formualted any idea
[20:02:06] <arryana> 'people's opinions are largely worthless.  they don't know what the fuck they think, or why they think it.  and if you ask them at a different time in a different mood, you'll get a different answer.  so what the fuck is -that- worth?;
[20:02:08] <arryana> and he was right.
[20:02:19] <biys> it's just as a result of the chaos that has been turned to order in my mind in some way
[20:02:31] <causative> well, when you are purely reacting then perhaps your preferences do not come into play
[20:02:31] <arryana> for someone's opinion to mean anything to me, they have to be invested enough in my life to bear some consequence for my decisions.
[20:02:35] <arryana> otherwise, they have no say.
[20:02:40] <causative> but you inescapably do have preferences, and act on them much of the time
[20:02:42] <audrey> I´m going to set up a bot to simulate causative´s talking points I think
[20:02:42] <arryana> why should they?
[20:02:49] <audrey> that way we can see who is more indefatigable
[20:02:53] <arryana> haha
[20:03:15] <biys> causative: i'm using your words.  i'll give you a bit of an example.  wheni was y ounger i wanted my favorite color to be the color blue.  my sister changed my mind
[20:03:23] <audrey> ten years of trying to talk to this guy has been like talking to a Socialist Realist painting and expecting it to reason with you
[20:03:24] <biys> now, with my own kids, my son likes blue and the daughter wants to like it too
[20:03:28] <biys> but the son doesn't want the daughter to like it
[20:03:29] <audrey> so Imma save my breath and go get something to eat
[20:03:39] <arryana> to be totally clear on the topic, i did not actually choose this hair color myself.  my best friend, who is a hair dresser, chose it the last time i saw her
[20:03:41] <biys> i wouldn't say that their "preferences" are in any way shape or form ANYTHING other than fluid
[20:03:44] <causative> ten years? did you have another nickname audrey ?
[20:03:44] <biys> maluable
[20:03:46] <arryana> and i've kept it this way, mostly because i love her.
[20:03:50] <audrey> causative: Yes
[20:03:57] <audrey> arryana: aww
[20:03:57] <pussipupu> arryana: in this house it's called bear nose sauce
[20:04:06] <causative> you're LexFerenda?
[20:04:08] <arryana> hahaha
[20:04:13] <biys> a preference isn't something that is, for example, biologically hard coded into you
[20:04:14] <arryana> well.  now it's bear nose sauce.  thank you.
[20:04:21] <biys> it's simply a result of circumstance
[20:04:39] <causative> biys, some preferences are biologically hardcoded
[20:04:44] <causative> if you are hungry you have a preference for food
[20:05:03] <biys> or perhaps a fear of dying
[20:05:07] <audrey> No, not her. I´m sure if someone has logs from that far back they can figure it out.
[20:05:31] <causative> audrey, are you confusing me with someone else?
[20:05:34] <biys> you might not necessarily WANT to eat.  you might HATE eating.  having to find food, prepare it, eat it, do the dishes, etc.
[20:05:43] <biys> "eating" might be the last thing one wants to do
[20:05:48] <biys> but they do it... not because of preference
[20:05:51] <arryana> there you go, that's more or less current
[20:06:15] <audrey> I´m not.
[20:06:23] <causative> I think you are though
[20:06:25] <biys> i understand what you're saying
[20:06:30] <biys> but i dno['t like the word prefrence
[20:06:45] <causative> certainly 10 years ago I wasn't talking about this particular subject
[20:06:54] <audrey> Not this particular subject, but the MO.
[20:07:09] <audrey> I have an elephant´s memory, I don´t need logs. :D
[20:07:14] <causative> I also had a different nick 10 years ago
[20:07:41] <causative> actually a lot of how I talked and what I talked about 10 years ago was different
[20:08:03] <biys> i think, personally, that freenode went through some shit, as did people.  it seems like irc went, almost, crazy for a while back.  people were super sensitive.  conversations could not be had.  i remember getting banned for so many things that are now considered mainstream
[20:08:11] <biys> everything seems to be okay now though
[20:08:23] <biys> it's back to peopel shit posting and everyone's fine with it
[20:08:48] <audrey> freenode was pretty bonkers even before the alleged Crown Prince took over
[20:09:00] <arryana> indeed
[20:09:06] <biys> it was in 2016 or 1015 i noticed the huge change
[20:09:09] <arryana> i doubt i would use irc at all if there were no /ignore function
[20:09:31] <causative> biys, if you eat, you do it because you preferred eating to something else
[20:09:36] <audrey> I used to be a lot more uptight about moderation in ##philosophy especially when meeple was running the show and would breathe down your neck for talking about how your day went («We´re not a public diary service!»)
[20:09:40] <arryana> too many pointless asshats think their words are solid gold, when in fact they're not worth reading
[20:09:43] <biys> i don't think there's any other options causative
[20:09:46] <biys> so it isn't really a preference
[20:09:52] <biys> you either eat and live or you don't eat and die
[20:09:59] <biys> if you're saying that smoeone has to have a "preference" to live
[20:10:02] <biys> i'd say you're mad
[20:10:03] <causative> no, you could skip a meal and go play volleyball instead
[20:10:07] <causative> you wouldn't die from that
[20:10:13] <audrey> I guess I got more cynical about the whole business of moderating in the interim
[20:10:17] * arryana nods
[20:10:20] <arryana> i don't blame you
[20:10:32] <causative> you chose to eat the meal instead of playing volleyball, *because* you preferred eating
[20:10:35] <biys> i'm not sure how volleyball would be a reasonable "preference" to choose, when it comes to eating for the sake of nutrition to continue living
[20:10:38] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:10:41] <audrey> And, moderating is a thankless job, just singles you out for abuse.
[20:10:48] <causative> you always have a choice biys
[20:10:53] <arryana> it really is.  you have my sympathy, and respect for dealing with it
[20:10:56] <biys> i would say th at is more-so being confused
[20:10:58] <biys> than it is a preference
[20:11:04] <audrey> «Well, you don´t have to continue walking across the street! You have the choice to let that eighteen wheeler mow you down!»
[20:11:14] <causative> I'm speaking of what you choose to do with a particular hour of your day biys
[20:11:14] <biys> idk if i always have a choice either
[20:11:17] <biys> sam harris talks abotu this
[20:11:20] <causative> it's always a choice to eat at a particular time
[20:11:22] <biys> and mr.robot talks about this
[20:11:26] <causative> or to do something else
[20:11:28] <audrey> I mean this is a Sartrean view of «choice», one that is true in a certain sense but completely meaningless when trying to understand the causes and motivations of everyday living and decisionmaking
[20:11:34] <biys> is it really MY CHOICE?
[20:11:39] <biys> coke or pepsi?
[20:11:43] <causative> yes
[20:12:02] <audrey> And I think even Sartre understood as much
[20:12:03] <biys> i'd say it's a result of our indoctrination
[20:12:08] <causative> sure
[20:12:21] <causative> it's your choice, and the choice you make is a result of your indoctrination (among other things)
[20:12:29] <causative> there's nothing incompatible there
[20:12:54] <biys> the choices aren't organic or with the full understanding understood
[20:12:56] <arryana> ooh, my food is here.  back in a bit.
[20:13:07] <biys> they are reactions
[20:13:19] <biys> not necesasrily something that is thought about or dwelled upon prior
[20:13:39] <causative> well, what if you do dwell on and think about the choice of coke vs pepsi beforehand?
[20:13:47] <causative> then do you say it's your choice?
[20:13:57] <biys> are the only teo options being provided coke and pepsi?  cause really i want a grape soda
[20:14:16] <biys> but i'll take the coke if i have to
[20:14:32] <causative> say it's just coke and pepsi then
[20:14:40] <biys> do yuo have any grape soda?
[20:14:44] <causative> no
[20:14:49] <biys> can you check in the back?
[20:14:57] <causative> are you a duck?
[20:15:34] <biys> i get what you're saying to an extent i think
[20:15:48] <biys> i'm just hung up on the word preference
[20:16:08] <causative> keeping in mind that when you dwell on and think about the choice of coke vs pepsi beforehand, your thoughts are *still* influenced by your genes and social environment
[20:16:20] <causative> just because something else influenced you, doesn't mean you didn't make a choice
[20:16:33] <causative> we should divest ourselves of naive and contradictory notions of "free will," and understand choice in a different way
[20:16:45] <biys> i'd say that even the formulation of the choice is more-so indoctrination than anything else though
[20:16:53] <causative> that is, we should understand "choice" in a way that the word is meaningful, rather than never applicable
[20:17:32] <causative> it is entirely possible that the world is fully deterministic, and it is still meaningful to talk about choices and preferences - fully determined choices and preferences, but so what?
[20:19:11] <causative> to prefer X to Y means that when given a choice of X or Y, you will say "give me X" or something to that effect
[20:19:48] <causative> to be given a choice of X or Y is to have actions available to you, which your brain selects among according to the information/patterns stored within it
[20:20:26] <biys> okay, that i'm fine with
[20:20:29] <biys> the last sentence
[20:20:55] <causative> the selection may occur in a fully deterministic way
[20:21:08] <causative> and the patterns may only be there in your head because something else caused them to be there
[20:21:16] <causative> and still the choice occurs
[20:21:26] <biys> i'm in.  you win
[20:22:15] <biys> i gotta find mattheiu
[20:32:31] <causative> anyway, you have preferences - undeniably - so we cannot be morally neutral, if morality is a question of what preferences you subscribe to
[20:32:39] *** Quits: foxbox (~cammy@user/cammy) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:33:02] <causative> it is possible to have a fully selfish morality, in which you prefer more stuff for yourself and don't care about anyone else, but this is not moral neutrality, it is simply a particular type of morality
[20:33:19] <causative> a particular type of preference for the way the world should be
[20:33:19] <I_Am_M00t> 🤔
[20:35:07] <causative> and then we notice that our preferences, like our beliefs, can change over time based on new information
[20:35:29] <causative> we can read a philosophy text and be persuaded of utilitarianism, or deontological ethics, or the original position, what-have-you
[20:36:15] <causative> and if when we are better informed we want X, then we "ought" to have wanted X all along - in the sense that, if we are rational, we would prefer to want the things we would want when better informed
[20:37:01] <causative> I use "want"/"preference"/"desire"/"goal" interchangeably

[22:02:31] <audrey> Fanta is widely considered a bottom-of-the-barrel soda choice in this part of the world.
[22:02:40] <audrey> Barely above Tang and Mountain Dew.
[22:04:18] <pussipupu> I used to drink Mountain Dew with Black Death vodka
[22:04:42] <audrey> (My ex used to drink Mountain Dew ... and had the teeth to prove it.)
[22:05:10] <audrey> IDK it was always my least favourite soda choice

[22:05:38] <pussipupu> I went through a brief phase and stopped again
[22:06:23] <pussipupu> Generally pop isn't my bag anyway, I mostly drink water if it's not hot or alcoholic
