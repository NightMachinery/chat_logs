[00:28:13] <onelegend> Is the seconds of delay in KeePass's Argon key derivation function the amount of time it takes to unlock the database with the knowledge of the password, or the amount of time per guess of the password (if someone were to brute force the password)
[00:28:51] <Tykling> it would have to be both right
[00:31:57] <iz> it's basically a form of processing that needs to happen on every password and that's how long it takes
[00:31:59] *** Quits: qbt (~qbt@user/edun) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:32:21] <Tykling> exactly
[00:32:44] <Alipha> onelegend: it's the same amount of time whether the password is correct or not. Unless you're talking about the very insignificant time of decrypting the database

[00:44:49] <onelegend> oh that makes sense
[00:45:02] <onelegend> so it takes a certain amount of time and memory to compute each password
[00:45:15] <onelegend> but I bet a supercomputer would be able to easily crack my database 
[00:45:28] <onelegend> master password is 6 words

[00:50:23] <danieldg> 77 bits is still a lot; you can calculate how much it costs to count that high using the bitcoin network as a benchmarker
[00:51:02] <Alipha> onelegend: the bitcoin network tests 2^77 hashes in about an hour
[00:51:59] <onelegend> ah
[00:52:20] <onelegend> that's pretty sweet
[00:52:28] <onelegend> I set the memory usage to 100MB
[00:52:38] <danieldg> so then the total mining fee collected in that hour = the cost to open your database if you used sha256 as the hash
[00:52:49] <danieldg> but argon is way way more expensive than sha256
[00:52:52] <onelegend> I use argon
[00:53:36] <danieldg> but really this is likely to be the strongest link in your security chain
[00:55:08] <sarnold> https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate hahaha, this website shows "160 million terahashes per second". what a silly measurement. I gotta do math to find out that that's around 10^20 hashes per day or 2^50 hashes per second
[00:55:39] <danieldg> it's like they didn't realize SI has prefixes higher than tera
[00:56:08] <sarnold> no one knows those though
[00:56:11] <sarnold> yet
[00:56:24] <danieldg> eh, peta is not uncommon when talking about HPC
[00:56:27] <sarnold> sure
[00:56:36] <sarnold> and china's claiming to have two exa machines online now..
[00:56:43] <sarnold> but that's like six people
[00:58:30] <danieldg> I'd still prefer they said "160 exahashes per second (or 160 million terahashes)" - it's both clear and educates people

[17:03:07] <neiluj> Thanks a lot!! If it is convincing for an internship on cryptography/cryptanalysis. If it is readable, if some sections could benefit from more details. Such internships are quite rare compared to network/computer security ones.
[17:03:59] <neiluj> Here it is: https://lutim.lagout.org/h6h7bENE/rNbPXAKC.png
[17:07:37] <MacGyver> Only comment I've got is that there's very little concrete information about the cryptography in there -- if there's anything particularly relevant to the internship in any of those programs you could consider highlighting that.
[17:08:00] *** Quits: frost (~frost@user/frost) (Quit: Connection closed)
[17:08:04] <MacGyver> But I assume there's also some kind of written application process so maybe you've got that covered.

[17:08:55] *** Joins: rtypo (~alex@user/rtypo)
[17:10:55] <neiluj> Oh right, the relevant coursework and grades are given in the cover letters. Since some application process only requires a cv, it would be a good idea to add them.
[17:11:23] <neiluj> Thanks, this is definitely something to pay attention to.
[17:11:58] <MacGyver> I wouldn't necessarily start adding precise grades.
[17:12:21] <MacGyver> For one thing, grading systems differ across countries; for another, it risks looking boastful.
[17:12:58] <MacGyver> But mentioning the coursework most relevant to the internship can't hurt.
[17:13:35] <neiluj> Oh, did not view it as such. Thought it was giving at least some credibility, even some "letters of nobility".
[17:14:55] <MacGyver> Yeah, so, stuff like "with honors" attached to a degree is fine.

[17:15:34] <MacGyver> I'm not saying everyone will have that reaction to it.
[17:15:40] <MacGyver> Just, it's a risk you run.
[17:15:45] <neiluj> Good, it's a balance between being convincing and not to "over the top/sugary sweet/etc"
[17:15:49] <MacGyver> Exactly.
[17:16:29] <neiluj> Thanks, hope it'll get better with more applications :)

[21:00:12] <yanmaani> For signing e-mails (á la PGP), how come RSA/whatever signatures are used instead of MAC on shared secret?
[21:01:03] <riv> because it works with public and private keys
[21:01:14] <riv> a MAC works when both parties have the same private key
[21:01:25] <yanmaani> Yeah, but if you have their public key and your private key, you can do Diffie-Hellman to derive a common secret
[21:01:29] <riv> this means either party can not only check MACs, but also create them
[21:01:43] <riv> public key and your private key <-- this is RSA stuff
[21:02:38] *** Joins: rtypo (~alex@user/rtypo)
[21:02:45] <yanmaani> Yes, but if you have your keypair (k1, K1) and they have their keypair (k2, K2), then dh(k1, K2) == dh(K1, k2).
[21:03:19] <yawkat> because GPG sucks
[21:03:26] <MacGyver> yanmaani: Do you want your corresponding party to be able to produce a document you never saw and claim you signed it?
[21:03:33] <riv> that's not actually the answer to this question is it yawkat?
[21:03:43] <yanmaani> MacGyver: Yes. Hopefully, our conversation is "for our eyes only"
[21:04:07] <riv> no it's not a positive feature that other people can forge signatures by you
[21:04:15] <MacGyver> yanmaani: Well, in the case of *signatures*, the answer is no.
[21:04:33] <yanmaani> Do YOU want your corresponding party to be able to produce a document you wrote to them in confidence and prove you signed it?
[21:04:41] <yanmaani> riv: they can't though
[21:04:44] <MacGyver> MACs aren't signatures, precisely because they *don't* have this feature.
[21:04:48] <riv> i know they can't
[21:04:51] <yanmaani> if I have such signature in my inbox, then I know 1 of 2 things
[21:04:53] <riv> because we use public/private keys to do it
[21:05:06] <yanmaani> 1: I forged it myself
[21:05:10] <yanmaani> 2: They signed it
[21:05:26] <riv> okay, this is called non-repudiation I think
[21:05:30] <yanmaani> but I can't leak it to a third party; it is not possible to prove anything without having my private key, and if I do, then I can forge anything
[21:05:36] <yanmaani> riv: right
[21:05:57] <riv> so what's your real question?
[21:06:01] <MacGyver> And because non-repudiation was considered a feature, not a bug, when PGP was created, that's why.
[21:06:20] <MacGyver> Signatures aren't MACs, and it's important to understand that distinction.
[21:07:12] <yanmaani> riv: Why doesn't PGP do repudiable signatures?
[21:07:37] <MacGyver> yawkat: Over to you.
[21:07:43] <riv> I suppose it was just an slightly bad design choice, they maybe didn't really know at the time
[21:07:57] <yanmaani> 'because GPG sucks' seems plausible, but 30 years on, you imagine someone would have fixed it
[21:08:00] <riv> these things are tricky and we have the benefit of hindsight now
[21:08:22] <yanmaani> like by patching GPG or coming up with an alternative or some such

[21:08:58] <riv> if you try to send patches in to GNU stuff you generally wont have much luck
[21:09:12] <MacGyver> yanmaani: We've kinda given up on PGP. Alternatives exist in the form of apps we'd usually call instant messaging, but they do have many of the features you'd want from e-mail for most encrypted cases.
[21:09:21] <riv> alternatives... unfortunately people don't really work hard on making good crypto software
[21:09:22] <yanmaani> fair enough, but why hasn't someone done a better e-mail too
[21:09:25] <yanmaani> l
[21:09:30] <riv> it think 'dont implement your own crypto' is part of it
[21:09:38] <yanmaani> every now and then I am forced to send e-mails
[21:09:44] <riv> problem with email is the network effect, sure you could implement something technically superior
[21:09:52] <MacGyver> Yeah... if only we were able to replace e-mail with something secured by design.
[21:09:56] <riv> but nobody is using it except you and that one guy you convinced to help you test it
[21:09:56] <yanmaani> thus GPG is the natural choice
[21:10:00] <MacGyver> The problem is the first part of the sentence.
[21:10:25] <yanmaani> riv: But you could do this in a semi-backwards compat way. Use GPG encryption, but MAC signatures.
[21:10:34] <yanmaani> PGP*
[21:10:54] <yanmaani> then you can strong-arm implementors into adding read-only signature support on the basis that people already use it
[21:11:00] <MacGyver> Note that PGP encryption does have an... interesting message integrity check.
[21:11:10] <MacGyver> And not validating that was one of the issues from EFAIL.
[21:11:20] <MacGyver> So it *kinda somewhat* MACs the message.
[21:11:37] <MacGyver> But that has nothing to do with the signature parts.
[21:14:48] <yanmaani> Has anyone done something like GPG but better?
[21:15:25] <yanmaani> like, normal e-mail encryption, presumably stateless so without PFS, but slightly nicer

[22:46:31] <yanmaani> System_Error: obviously true, but you still have to get all the parts right

[23:14:06] <yanmaani> I've had the idea of just doing e-mail over ricochet. You send your e-mails to whatever@<long onion>. Your MTA waits until their MTA goes online.
[23:14:13] <yanmaani> rqsd: for whom?
[23:14:43] <yanmaani> I have the, admittedly niche, problem of needing a replacement to use for technologically competent individuals. There is no such replacement, obscure or not.
[23:14:59] <yawkat> what are "e-mail shaped messages"
[23:15:29] <yanmaani> yawkat: messages that aren't like two sentences
[23:15:31] <yawkat> you cannot get good security for something that works exactly like email, but you can get good security in almost all cases that *use* email
[23:15:43] <yanmaani> yeah I'm fine if it's a bit rougher
[23:15:46] <yawkat> you can send as many sentences as you like with signal
[23:16:02] <yanmaani> yes, but as a practical matter, I don't want to give out my phone number
[23:16:07] <rqsd> You're not getting people to do long-form messages while phoneposting
[23:16:08] <yanmaani> or mess around with burners
[23:16:14] <yanmaani> or do ALL MY E-MAIL ON THE PHONE
[23:16:19] <rqsd> The notion of burner phones is absolutely hilarious to me
[23:16:42] <yanmaani> "no problem sir, I have the tax documents, I'll text them to you over Signal"
[23:16:49] <yawkat> people do this
[23:16:49] <rqsd> Its proponents have no notion of having to show ID to get a SIM card, like it's an alien concept to them
[23:16:50] <yanmaani> "from my burner phone"
[23:16:56] <System_Error> yanmaani> IIRC at least some bitmessage clients can pretend they're kinda "email". While really being p2p net with pow. But guess this even less audited and far more scary than tox...
[23:17:04] <yanmaani> yawkat: yes, and they're masochists
[23:17:09] <yanmaani> I want a non-masochist solution
[23:17:22] <yawkat> yanmaani: about half the world conducts gov business over whatsapp
[23:17:28] <yawkat> theyre doing fine
[23:17:38] <rqsd> I know a gov't that bought into Threema
[23:17:43] <yanmaani> I'm not even sure how to move text from my phone to my computer? do I connect it over USB? scan QR codes?
[23:18:04] <yawkat> there is a signal desktop app (and a whatsapp web app)
[23:18:11] <yanmaani> yawkat: I am not interested in doing all my e-mail over the phone because the only acceptable encryption tool is provided by one American company with strange tastes
[23:18:18] <yanmaani> "use signal for everything" no thank you
[23:18:58] <yanmaani> "yeah uh, if you want encryption you have to use this one app"
[23:19:08] <yanmaani> we gave up on everything else. hope you like moxie marlinspike.
[23:19:34] <yawkat> and email is any better?
[23:19:47] <yawkat> the difference is that one of the protocols is developed in this decade
[23:19:49] <rqsd> Communication will inevitably get centralized because network effects incentivize centralization
[23:19:54] <rqsd> There's no winning
[23:20:10] <yawkat> theres no winning if you consider centralization "losing".
[23:20:26] <rqsd> yawkat: I was just going along with yanmaani's premise
[23:21:00] <rqsd> The actual solution is a shutdown of the Internet as we know it and instead have highly regulated, green-field developed national/regional networks
[23:21:05] <yanmaani> yawkat: huh?
[23:21:13] <yanmaani> I can't self-host signal
[23:21:18] <yanmaani> I can't develop my own clients for signal
[23:21:23] <riv> we went over all this
[23:21:33] <yanmaani> if you're gonna suggest stuff like that, at least use matrix
[23:21:40] <yawkat> yanmaani: okay, and how are either of these things a practical disadvantage?
[23:21:54] <yanmaani> but I do not want to use phone-dependent software made by litigious horrible people in America
[23:22:01] <riv> yawkat: it has essentially no security at all if it's dependent on a 3rd party server
[23:22:10] <yanmaani> yawkat: I do not want to acquire burner phones
[23:22:23] <yanmaani> I do not want to ahve to deal with shady Russian sites that I pay cryptocurrency and get VoIP numbers
[23:22:24] <yawkat> riv: what? centralized signal is a lot more secure than decentralized email.
[23:22:25] <yanmaani> this is not acceptable UX
[23:22:51] <riv> oh yeah and its based on a phone number lmao
[23:22:54] <yanmaani> "just do everything under your real name" thank you for you security advice, immensely helpful
[23:22:57] <riv> apparently people don't even see why this is a problem
[23:23:12] <yawkat> yanmaani: i get that requiring a phone number isnt great, but why do you always say "i want decentralization" and when i ask why you fall back on the same phone number argument?
[23:23:14] <System_Error> <rqsd> Communication will inevitably get centralized because network effects incentivize centralization <- No any nature or math law fundamentally asserts this.
[23:23:16] <yanmaani> if signal didn't require phone numbers, it'd be like 10x better
[23:23:26] <yanmaani> yawkat: Because centralization is the root cause.
[23:23:37] <yanmaani> If anyone could throw up a Signal server, I could just use one that didn't enforce phone no.
[23:23:46] *** Quits: CryptoClub (~fafs@87.125.251.76) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:24:02] <yawkat> then it wouldnt be signal anymore lol
[23:24:03] <yanmaani> So a slightly different world in which OWS just allowed you to use whatever instead, would still run into the problem of "great until OWS does something stupid"
[23:24:12] <yanmaani> yawkat: now, you could do federation
[23:24:17] <yawkat> you are wrongly blaming this on centralization, when it isnt
[23:24:21] <yanmaani> matrix seems to work, other than the minor implementation issues
[23:24:32] <yanmaani> no, centralzation is directly responsible for singal requiring phone number...
[23:24:34] <yawkat> a fedarated signal could require phone number verification just like a centralized could
[23:24:45] <yawkat> i dont see how this is in any way related to centralization
[23:24:47] <yanmaani> not if phone ver. were up to each server.
[23:25:01] <System_Error> yawkat> until point provider elects to deny you access to their servers. At this point you enjoy full extent of "security".
[23:25:02] <yawkat> yes if signal didnt require phone number verification it would not require phone number verification
[23:25:04] <yanmaani> For example, servers could allocate free-use phone number blocks, like 555 in America, to anyone who does a CAPTCHA
[23:25:27] <yanmaani> yawkat: Right. The root cause is their guys having total control over it, and threatening to sue anyone into the ground.
[23:25:44] <yawkat> System_Error: okay, but the same happens with email now. and it's a lot more of an issue with email, because the provider can actually read your mail.
[23:25:45] <rqsd> This is getting too /r/privacy for me, peace
[23:25:59] <riv> yeah we need to like drop this or something
[23:26:04] <System_Error> yawkat> if things go real bad one can set up own server after all.
[23:26:04] <riv> it's a just loop
[23:26:08] <yanmaani> "hey, at least it's better than e-mail"
[23:26:21] <yanmaani> thank you and good night
[23:26:24] <System_Error> wouldn't fully save from google seeing everything -> gmail, but, still.
[23:26:34] <yanmaani> for my christmas wish, I want someone to do a 100% clone of Signal, but new servers without phone verificaiton.
[23:26:39] <yanmaani> keep all the crypto etc the same
[23:26:41] <yanmaani> everything else, just no phones.
[23:26:47] <riv> yanmaani: is signal actually that good that it's worth cloning
[23:26:57] <yawkat> yes it is.
[23:26:58] <riv> i think we can probably do better, i feel like the internals are massively overcomplicated

[23:27:57] <yawkat> System_Error: thats how the internet works.
[23:28:11] <System_Error> yawkat> no.
[23:28:21] <yawkat> decentralization on the internet is a myth
[23:28:33] <System_Error> Internet been P2P from very start
[23:28:35] <yanmaani> I'm not sure it's any better or worse than Matrix
[23:28:35] <yanmaani> but it beats GPG and such. It also has some advantages over say OTR
[23:28:35] <yanmaani> System_Error: nothing, but we've moved from "X is bad" to "Y could be bad".
[23:29:04] <yawkat> System_Error: do you know what the topology of the internet looks like? it's not p2p at all.
[23:29:20] <yanmaani> "actually, things have never been fully decentralized, so why don't you go all the way"
[23:29:26] <yanmaani> thank you for your insight
[23:29:37] <System_Error> yawkat> yes, I do. But, still, protocol been designed more or less symmetric, and client and server are fairly abstract notions.
[23:30:05] <System_Error> And so p2p designs are quite a win, merely leveraging true nature of underlying protocol :P
[23:30:33] <yawkat> except everyone is behind a NAT now and then client and server become quite distinct
[23:30:37] <cvmn> quic is interesting.  i wish they didn't have tls in it (but leave it to higher layers to decide how to encrypt).  i think the future is that effectively tcp's job will be in the userspace (some kind of a micro-kernel design).  udp in the kernel will be there for as long as the kernel is doing the job of packet-to-socket mapping.

[23:31:56] <yawkat> finally we get to deal with udp traffic too!
[23:32:14] <System_Error> yawkat> there's IPv6, or e.g. .onion/i2p and so on. 
[23:32:21] <cvmn> some isps block udp sadly.  that will probably change thanks to to quic.
[23:32:41] <sarnold> block udp? o_O
[23:32:49] <sarnold> that's a recipe for horrible internet experience
[23:32:56] <cvmn> yes.  or heavily mistreat udp.
[23:33:06] <yawkat> System_Error: most IPv6 end users are behind firewalls that require a form of "hole punching" too, just without the masquerading.
[23:33:28] <yawkat> and tor isnt decentralized, theres not so many directory servers.
[23:33:31] <System_Error> yawkat> have you even seen IPv6? oO
[23:33:32] <cvmn> sarnold: this is why goog added tcp fallback to quic.  some say that google chrome does both tcp and udp at the same time, just in case udp didn't work.
[23:33:49] <System_Error> nice to say when isp just gave me ipv6 /56, huh?
[23:34:10] <yawkat> System_Error: but your router or even the isp still firewalls it.
[23:34:19] <yawkat> just not NAT.
[23:34:30] <sarnold> cvmn: what a sad state of affairs :(
[23:35:00] *** Quits: qbt (~qbt@user/edun) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:35:06] <cvmn> sarnold: yeah.  technically i think udp is all what we ever needed in kernel, and tcp should've been just libtcp in userspace atop udp.
[23:35:26] <System_Error> yawkat> my router merely gives out /64 v6 nets to any device that asks.
[23:35:40] <yawkat> System_Error: ... and firewalls them, probably.
[23:36:01] <sarnold> cvmn: I dunno, most attempts to do tcp-ish things on top of udp tend to fail pretty badly
[23:36:17] <cvmn> sarnold: why?
[23:36:57] <System_Error> yawkat> good luck to say me what my routers do =). I fully control all this tho. And no, its real connectivity. Accessible from outside.
[23:37:05] <sarnold> cvmn: because tcp has decades of real-world use and testing and corner-case handling, and centralized in a handful of high-quality implementations..
[23:37:06] <System_Error> So I can ssh to my machines, etc :P
[23:37:07] <riv> cvmn: that sounds like a bad idea for reasons that I cant really elucidate well
[23:37:27] <riv> there are userland network stacks
[23:37:35] <sarnold> cvmn: most efforts to do tcp-ish things on udp are done by small teams who think it can all be small and simple and fast and they run face-first into the real world when they try to use it in the wild
[23:37:37] <yawkat> System_Error: okay, great security setup there... and not reflective of most home users
[23:37:39] <riv> and they're for high throughput stuff, to avoid kernel context switching
[23:38:07] <System_Error> yawkat> systems are supposed to defend self. And I guess their security is ... good enough.
[23:38:27] <yawkat> ... you rely completely on endpoint firewalls?
[23:38:50] <yawkat> amazing
[23:39:02] <System_Error> yawkat> its a bit more complicated than that in reality but your head would explode if you'll see my setup...
[23:39:16] <cvmn> riv: can you try to elucidate?
[23:39:23] <riv> no
[23:39:55] <cvmn> then your claim is put on hold until your proof is supplied.
[23:40:25] <yawkat> TIL that quic is already 8% of internet traffic
[23:40:34] <yawkat> thats actually impressive
[23:41:24] <cvmn> sarnold: those reasons were true for tcp when tcp was new.

[23:45:24] <yawkat> until your gov blocks it. see the non-functioning of tor in china
[23:45:30] <System_Error> its another layer of abstraction, and it holds as long as underlying stuff more or less passes data.
[23:45:57] <System_Error> yawkat> and see many advanced net tools on github by chinese coders :)
[23:46:26] <System_Error> tor also not fully p2p thing, to begin with. There're somewhat centralised "directories".

[23:49:01] <System_Error> Designs like tox lack "really special" servers and so on. This is tradeoff, it opens ways to certain attacks.
[23:50:44] <yawkat> except for the bootstrap servers?
[23:51:17] <cvmn> is there any privacy unfriendly fields in http/2?  e.g. user-agent still there?  anything worse?
[23:51:32] <yawkat> http2 is almost exactly like http1 semantically
[23:51:47] <yawkat> same headers (mostly)
[23:53:10] <System_Error> <yawkat> except for the bootstrap servers? <- to... some extent. Its okay to e.g. bootstrap from own nodes already in net, etc.
[23:53:55] <yawkat> pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps
[23:54:25] <System_Error> yawkat> its most funny part :P. C compilers also do that. So?
[23:55:14] <System_Error> So my gcc built by itself, is it any bad? Oh, sure, theoretically, there should be something before compiler to get there...
[23:57:14] <System_Error> or say bitcoin core now knows few thousands of IPs. Even if all boostrap means are out, it would be able to reenter.
[23:58:08] <yawkat> the problem is not stochastic fault tolerance, it is tolerance to an adversary that owns the network
[23:58:27] <yawkat> p2p solutions are supposed to prevent actors like the gov from affecting the protocol, but they cant
[23:58:43] <yawkat> the gov can simply block the full list
[23:59:03] <System_Error> in principle adversary can just halt all traffic they dont like. In exchange they'll get it morphed to something else. Its a stalemate.
[23:59:16] <cvmn> i'm considering to create alternative to html/css/js.  a new format where server only offers content, and client does all the presentation.  this way zero information about the client should leak to the server (e.g. on canvas, os, version, etc).
[23:59:45] <System_Error> And "full list" is quite dynamic. Oh, would they block all these .onion and .i2p btc nodes too?
[23:59:50] <yawkat> (there are "real" p2p systems that dont have this problem, see mesh messaging)
