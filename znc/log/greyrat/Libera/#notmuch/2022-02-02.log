[15:30:45] <mdt> i already told that i am about to write a  notmuch based MUA i would need some help with message ids, sent mails & notmuch and so on. is somewhere around who could help me with that? for example: where can i find information about handling message ids for various cases? (is it only RFCs?)
[15:39:29] <bremner> mdt: what do you mean by "handling message ids"? parsing them?
[16:22:50] <mdt> no, when to put them where ;)
[16:23:26] <mdt> and how the storing is done and refreshing notmuch
[16:23:46] <mdt> is the filename from that id as well?
[16:30:38] <bremner> the second question is easier, notmuch doesn't make up file names, it uses whatever is on the disk
[16:32:40] <bremner> refreshing the notmuch database is typically done by one of the CLI commands insert, new, or reindex. There is a corresponding C API, but some of the work is done in the CLI code (e.g. finding which files to index)
[16:46:19] <mdt> bremner: ah, notmuch insert is exactly what i need with a tag sent? what is notmuch-emacs using?

[21:59:59] <bremner> no, drafts are handled seperately from Fcc on output email. Both use notmuch-insert.
[22:08:51] <mdt> so (sorry to ask again) if you miss the fcc the mail is lost after sending?
[22:09:20] <bremner> yes, unless you CC or Bcc yourself
[22:09:54] <mdt> ok. thats a different aproach.

[22:15:46] <drvink> bremner: success report for using liier to import gmail -> maildir, then indexing with notmuch.  thanks for the suggestion :)
[22:16:10] <bremner> drvink: cool
[22:26:13] <mdt> does notmuch honor the rather complex quirks of Message-ID, References, In-Reply-To to form threads?
[22:26:29] <bremner> it tries
[22:26:52] <mdt> (i am reading rfc2822 and try to understand that)
[22:27:15] <bremner> I think there is a newer rfc 5xxx?
[22:27:18] <mdt> how does emacs-notmuch cope with it?
[22:27:34] <mdt> oh, i did not know.. wait
[22:30:55] <mdt> found 5321 about smtp and 5322 but both dont cover that - do you have a number?
[22:31:32] <bremner> not offhand.
[22:34:05] <mdt> i knew it was a mistake to start to write a MUA ;) this is the point i was afraid of.. i remember long discussions about it when using mutt.
[22:34:29] *** Joins: cworth (~cworth@198.236.192.246)
[22:34:45] <bremner> well, you can just trust notmuch to do threading mostly OK.
[22:35:17] <mdt> sure, i looks quite well but a mua should fill the fields correctly
[22:35:18] <olly> probably less well the older the mail is
[22:35:24] <bremner> I mean, you don't need to know the RFCs to use the notmuch thread API
[22:35:35] <mdt> indeed
[22:35:43] <bremner> olly: oh? I thought everything about mail was getting worse
[22:35:50] <mdt> but notmuch doesnt compose emails for me ;)
[22:36:27] <bremner> mdt: you can look at what notmuch-reply does, although I'm not sure I really recommend using notmuch-reply, it's a bit inflexible
[22:36:42] <olly> back in the day, references: in mail was not really usefully defined for threading, but it seems usenet style references: is now widely used
[22:36:55] <olly> perhaps even RFCed - i stopped closely following mail RFCs a while ago though
[22:37:15] <bremner> OK. probably we are both right and it peaked in 2003
[22:37:41] <olly> and in-reply-to was kind of free form, and e.g. could contain an email address which is syntactically a valid message-id
[22:38:40] <bremner> yeah, there's some business about obsolete syntax
[22:39:44] <bremner> there's actually an current bug report in notmuch from a decade ago or so, but the syntax was already obsolete for a decade then
