[13:20:55] <bagder> ESphynx: and size is always 1 in libcurl ... so both things are true
[13:22:14] <bagder> anyway, we will of course appreciated improved docs as well!
[13:22:20] <bagder> *appreciate
[13:33:04] <p-i-__> Is there any plan to encompass websockets in libcurl? I remember reading that it was discussed...
[13:33:14] <bagder> it has been discussed
[13:33:35] <bagder> if someone sponsors the work it might happen
[13:34:20] <bagder> I've talked to one company about it, but it looks like they might not bite
[13:34:37] <p-i-__> Do you survive from sponsors?
[13:35:46] <bagder> I used the word sponsor, meaning someone to pay for it. I "survive" on curl contract signing companies
[13:36:12] <bagder> mostly support contracts
[13:36:26] <bagder> but contract feature development is fine too
