[00:44:00] <melezhik> I gave been playing with Sparky JobAPI. It turns out that Sparky async jobs work really well with Raku embedded async features - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky#job-api
[00:44:02] <tellable6> 2021-12-17T15:34:23Z #raku <tbrowder> melezhik thanks
[00:44:07] <melezhik> some examples are here
[00:45:01] <melezhik> I am not sure if this is possible in any existing CICD system - for examplescontrolled recursive builds  :]
[00:46:05] <melezhik> technically it give an extreme freedom to write CICD pipelines and workflows of any complexity ... and all Raku async none blocking fashion
[00:47:00] <melezhik> plus Sparky itself runs jobs (builds) asynchronously - in a sense - as parallel jobs - processes
[00:47:34] <melezhik> while high level scenario would wait till jobs are finished using supply/tap/Curlie HTTP

[15:48:20] <holyghost> Aaaaah! There's no perl6 anymore ! :-)
[15:48:44] <tbrowder> don’t laugh, but has anyone any interest in a mod_raku for apache http server?
[15:48:57] <holyghost> yes
[15:49:13] <holyghost> Need a separate binary AFAIK
[15:49:39] <Summer> raku for lwan 😳
[15:49:59] <tbrowder> ah, that’s right.
[15:50:50] <tbrowder> ?
[15:51:35] <holyghost> Also, we can update the raked site then, with more binaries (e.g. mod_raku)
[15:51:45] <holyghost> s/raked/rakudo/
[15:52:34] <Summer> https://lwan.ws/ its a dis at the closed source "quantum proof horizontally parallisable" gwan
[15:52:36] <holyghost> I guess Debian would be interested
[15:53:11] <tbrowder> i hope so :-)
[15:57:25] <holyghost> I had the horse book back in the day (mod_perl), but I guess there's a place for raku web programming in raku.so AFAIK
[15:58:02] <tbrowder> holyghost: i have some cgi working using raku
[15:58:20] <holyghost> sure

[16:00:13] <holyghost> tbrowder, as in php.so, I don't know the mod_perl things
[16:00:19] <holyghost> For apache I mean
[16:01:04] <holyghost> PHP is somewhat nicer and uses perl syntax
[16:01:20] <tbrowder> i don’t need super speed so raku interp has worked fine where used so far
[16:01:33] <holyghost> sure
[16:01:42] <holyghost> But you can extend it

[16:09:03] <lizmat> tbrowder: the latest Cro has reverse proxy support, no ?
[16:10:24] <tbrowder> yes, but i’ve talked to jnthn about it a bit. and getting tls support on the inside is a bit sticky.
[16:11:00] <tbrowder> on my main site i use tls certs for private user access
[16:11:06] <lizmat> ah, I see: most reverse proxies I had to work with, didn't need that because they ran on trusted networks

[21:26:43] <lizmat> there's also DB::Pg   I have no experience in either.  jnthn said he liked the more rakuish interface of DB::Pg in their advent post last year
[21:28:41] <thowe> Oh.  I think I misunderstood that.  I think I assumed DB::Pg was somehow used by DBIish.
[21:30:01] <thowe> Given my current mindset I think I would err on the side of "more rakuish interface".

[21:36:32] <thowe> I did not for the original code.  In fact, my displeasure at what Ruby had to offer in that area at the time led to me learning Perl so I could use DBIC.

[22:41:20] <thowe> That's my goal.  After 15 years of thinking about the problem, I haven't really come up with better logic.  However, I think I can make it look nicer, be more clear, and arrange it in a way that better exposes the problem it is solving.  Also, I think I can keep it very discoverable to my colleagues who use Ruby, etc...
[22:42:24] <thowe> And, maybe, I'll actually come up with a few better ideas along the way.  I intend to do it without referencing the old code.

This particular problem is pretty easy to add some optimization to because you can get the most common cases out of the way up front.  The meat is in handling the combinations of edge cases.
[22:51:17] <thowe> But I learn in a bubble...  Code in a bubble.  Have a lot of other things to do.  If it weren't for IRC I would be worse off; a lot of Perl folks have been very patient with me.
[22:53:39] <lizmat> if you can improve the algorithm, that's ok!   what El_Che means is that generally finding the fastest way to do something in Raku given a certain algorithm, is generally not worth it
