[02:41:09] <moldorcoder7> i tested their lsp native , but i m not a fan of early adoption, and coc just works for all other languages
[02:41:25] <moldorcoder7> and it was even worth
[02:41:50] <moldorcoder7> issue is that angular template have .html extension and im not sure if one can have more then 1 client per file format

[03:55:59] <moldorcoder7> ncwbqcfe, ha that yeah , also there is a mismatch upon my testing between lsp-install and lsp-config, first one configured badly second
[03:56:05] <moldorcoder7> also loosing vim compatibility is a nogo
[03:57:28] <ncwbqcfe> personally I don't mind losing the later :/
[03:57:38] <ncwbqcfe> :)*
[03:58:19] <ncwbqcfe> atm I still prefer coc just bc it's more battle tested.
[03:58:27] <moldorcoder7> yeah correct
[03:58:41] <moldorcoder7> except that angular thing it is just perfect
[03:59:10] <ncwbqcfe> heh, if could could help I would, but I simply don't touch anything angular.
[03:59:34] <ncwbqcfe> s/could could/I could.
[03:59:49] <moldorcoder7> it is not that bad , but i hate gui in general :)
[03:59:57] <ncwbqcfe> same
[04:02:27] <ncwbqcfe> moldorcoder7: what's the issue with angular specifically, if simple to install/test I could give it a try on my side.
[04:04:04] <moldorcoder7> ncwbqcfe, all the ts and angular specific attributes , one can event autocomplete things like (click)="mytsfunc()"
[04:04:16] <moldorcoder7> i mean all that works
[04:04:17] <moldorcoder7> but
[04:04:48] <moldorcoder7> the on the angular templates , if you have some tags like the angular material tags , or the one from your own components
[04:05:09] <moldorcoder7> then one dont have autocompletion and the linter complains 
[04:05:37] <ncwbqcfe> because it can't parse angular you mean?
[04:05:46] <ncwbqcfe> angular syntax
[04:06:24] <moldorcoder7> ncwbqcfe, the angular specific syntax is ok , picked up by coc-angular , but the specific tags from components are not , 
[04:06:44] <moldorcoder7> for instance the most common component from angular-material is mat-card
[04:07:06] <moldorcoder7> so if you put <mat-card> blagh </mat-card>
[04:07:34] <moldorcoder7> the linter complainsm there is no autocompletion and no code action for instance to recommend inporting the MatCard obbject into the upper modile
[04:07:40] <moldorcoder7> s/modile/module
[04:07:53] <moldorcoder7> sorry for typos :(
[04:08:02] <moldorcoder7> was carried away :)
[04:08:29] <moldorcoder7> i did CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-css coc-html coc-tailwindcss

[04:40:55] <moldorcoder7> took me the day to understand :)
[04:41:46] <ncwbqcfe> readme states coc-angular is a fork of vscode counterpart, and most commits on upgrades should borrow from upstream.

[23:17:10] <bn_work> hi, is anyone aware of a way to atomicize saving in vim + committing (and perhaps pushing) to git(hub)?

[23:39:01] <bn_work> ncwbqcfe:  not sure if that was directed to me?  if so, no one said anything about rebasing or force-pushing?  it's also possible to push to a develop, ie: non-prod branch.  Lastly, this isn't my choice, I'm being "asked" to do this 🤷
