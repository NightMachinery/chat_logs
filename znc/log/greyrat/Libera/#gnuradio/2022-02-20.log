The tone of your question suggests that you may not have such cred?  Gnu Radio isn't, as I've said many many times before "A Radio WIth a Lot of Knobs".  It's a software development environment that is "tuned" to real-time signal-processing applications, usually involving radio.

[23:02:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> I will allow as how I might have "Grumpy Old Man" turned up a notch or two today.  Put it down to the stress of a significant personal crisis.  Having said *that*, I have never thought that GR was a good way to learn programming--because it's so very inter-disciplinary.  GRC tends to lull you into thinking you don't need to understand things like "algorithms and why you need them", but in nearly all cases, once you wander beyond the
[23:02:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> simple examples, some amount of programming accumen is pretty-much essential.    Further, because the field "things you might want to do at the intersection of computers and radios" is so very very very large that in many cases, you have wander off the track provided by GRC and the existing blocks and do some custom programming.  
[23:03:20] <LordKalma> yo grampa, what's up?
[23:03:31] <Yamakaja[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: "significant personal crisis" You alright?
[23:03:49] <LordKalma> is this about your gf?
[23:04:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Just stressing over a bunch of things some of which are under my control, some not.
[23:04:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> LordKalma: Yeah.  Still waiting to hear the results of the scans.  But given her cancer history, I'm not hopeful.
[23:05:03] <Yamakaja[m]> Ow :(
[23:05:37] <LordKalma> best of luck
[23:05:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> LordKalma: Thanks.
[23:06:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> On a brighter(ish) note, we're (CCERA) going to be helping out these folks: https://www.inverse.com/science/interstellar-alien-life
[23:06:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> Oh, no, wait.
[23:06:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> https://www.inverse.com/science/black-hole-merger-2022
[23:07:00] <LordKalma> selecting text on that site is funky
[23:07:08] <LordKalma> the title, specifically
[23:07:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> Distant (1.2Gly) galaxy that they think might be about to swallow a companion black-hole, and if it does, the radio brightness will increase spectacularly.
[23:08:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's only about 1.6 times further away than Cygnus A, and Cygnus A has very-bright thermal lobes in its jets.  This galaxy (J1420+2303) may well spawn jets should this collision occur.
[23:08:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> CCERA contact the P.I.s and they're keen to have us do daily monitoring with the big NATO dish.  So, we're busy trying to make that happen.
[23:09:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> So I'm doing the "headless chicken" trying to get stuff ready.    We can just "park" the dish at +23 and observe in transit mode.  A few minutes every 24 hours will be plenty to spot trends.
[23:24:08] <LordKalma> that's very cool 
[23:24:13] <LordKalma> I hope you get some nice data
[23:24:50] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun: sorry to hear about the personal situation. that's rough. 
[23:24:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> GIven the approximately ~1mJy steady-state flux of J1430+2303, we'll get nothing interesting (other than a well-integrated baseline) until "something happens".
[23:25:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Thanks.  Went through this hell 9 years ago when she had her first bout with TNBC.  But going a second round with TNBC and winning is very very very rare.
[23:26:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> We've all been trying to jolly ourselves into thinking "it's just a cyst".  But given her history...
[23:37:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> We'll have position-feedback on the big dish elevation axis very soon--I have some Level Developments USB sensors and there's this convenient shaft where NATO used to have a sensor box.  Azimuth will require a shaft encoder of some sort.  Still thinking about that.

[23:41:17] <DerekKozel[m]> I do definitely also agree SDR and GR are a deep hole that covers a lot of different spaces. It's a lot of learning through finding the sharp edges in software, RF, analog, and digital. Often all at the same time

[23:44:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's not a lot different than deciding that you're going to build yourself a general-coverage HF transceiver, but without much background in electronics, soldering, etc, etc.
[23:44:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: Some time in the next couple of years is the current estimate.
[23:46:15] <LordKalma> wow, I didn't know astrophysicists could even think that fast :D 
[23:46:28] <LordKalma> 1M years is the error bar usually :p
[23:47:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> In this case, the UV and X-Ray variability data strongly suggest and in-spiralling companion, and having mass estimates, etc, etc.

[23:48:03] <LordKalma> also, learning digital stuff is "easier" in the sense that if I wanted to learn to do really nice analogue boards it'd be very expensive :p

[23:49:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> But, as I've observed before, "growing up digital" tends to skew your design sense when you encounter radios for the first time.  
[23:49:19] <LordKalma> yes, that's a fair observation 
[23:49:46] <LordKalma> haha I like my balance between my daytime job and the hobby
[23:49:53] <Yamakaja[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: As in for example? I'd consider myself as having grown up digital :D
[23:50:02] <LordKalma> not the same thing, but mutually complementary in terms of knowledge

[23:51:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Actual example.  User sends a stream of *samples* on the TX port, and is *stunned* to discover that the samples at the RX are completely different.  If you've spent most of your time playing with digital systems in general, and computers in particular, the notion that you might send a data value and that it would arrive as a *different* data value on the other side can be shocking.  That's an actual example.

[23:52:28] <IanW> Where is the dish located  ?
[23:52:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> "why when I crank up the gain do my sin waves look like crap?"

[23:53:00] <Yamakaja[m]> Ouch, i suppose that does indeed sound like someone isn't considering the analog side of the system 🤦‍♂️
[23:53:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> former NATO earth station
[23:53:11] <IanW> Actually, you probably did send the spurs, in the data modulation...
[23:53:17] <LordKalma> hahaha
[23:53:28] <LordKalma> of those folks saw the output spectrum of an optical modulator
[23:53:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> IanW: There's a lot of "ite depends"
[23:53:42] <Yamakaja[m]> Spurs in the modulation as in bad symbol distribution?
[23:54:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> I've always held that the naive should not be allowed to look at an FFT output from a real receiver until they understand how they work, and where the non-idealities are.  It would save a tremendous amount of mailing-list and chat channel traffic :) :)
[23:55:03] <LordKalma> patchvonbraun[m], and Yamakaja[m] I've had to explain to a colleague from EE at work that NO SIGNALS ON CABLES ARE NOT COMPLEX
[23:55:09] <IanW> Any modulation of a pure sine produces spurs, that is where the data is carried.
[23:55:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> IanW: Those aren't spurs, those are intended sidebands.   Spur is short for "spurious".  Stuff that isn't part of what was intended.
[23:56:21] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/6199a07e6d147a3387f9a72dbf22fda8.jpg
[23:56:32] <LordKalma> this is what an optical spectrum usually looks like after modulation
[23:56:50] <LordKalma> I guarantee you that I didn't put in all of that crap in the signal generator :p
[23:56:58] <IanW> Indeed
[23:57:45] <IanW> But one mans signal is another mans noise :-)
[23:58:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> Consider what happens when you TX signal is ever-so-slightly not purely sinusoidal (for a CW signal).  There will be spectral components in RX FFT that are "unexpected".    Now, whether they matter or not depends very much on the comms system in question.  An unwanted spur on a transmitter that is 80dB below the intended signal may be annoying in an FFT, but in practice is almost never an actual problem.
[23:58:16] <LordKalma> basically on an optical modulator, achieving 20dBs of clean vertical range is a *miracle*
[23:58:34] <Yamakaja[m]> IanW: Not sure what you mean - are you referring to intermodulation products in non-ideal mixers?
[23:58:54] <LordKalma> 80dB under? hahaha I wish I had >8 bits
