[01:44:27] <forgotmynick> When I SSH into a remote machine through Windows or Mac, I have a script that generates URL's. The URL's seem to be clickable but is there anyway to use custom text but also make it clickable? Similar to how html a tags work? `<a href='xxx'>text</a>`

[01:48:49] <ormaaj> forgotmynick: Do you mean you want that in your terminal emulator? Some have a feature like that which works through pure pattern matching but I don't know of a feature for designating a clickable region by terminal escape.
[01:51:44] *** dob1_ is now known as dob1
[01:54:17] <ormaaj> Possibly you could conjure something in tmux by interacting with it through a script. There are configurable menus and things . I haven't seen anything exactly like a way to overlay clickable links arbitrarily though.

[14:29:06] <rhombus> I am trying to write a script to simplify scp file transfers using positional arguments but while handling arguments with multiple words. I have a script that works for uploads, but not for downloads: https://dpaste.com/GX3X6BWNW
[14:31:00] <rhombus> The upload works if I quote the argument. The download does not work if I quote the argument. If I type 'testbed_scp user download "bip bap.txt"', for example, I get an error message saying 'scp: bip: No such file or directory' and 'scp: bop.txt: No such file or directory'.
[14:31:41] <rhombus> If I use backslash to escape the space, it works -- the file is downloaded -- but then saved locally with the name 'bip\ bap.txt', which isn't what I want either.
[14:31:57] <rhombus> What am I missing?

[17:10:37] <greycat> It means your data file is not strictly a text file, and some programs will have trouble with it if they expect it to be text.

[21:43:18] <soham> We have a huge filesystem structure where tons of files/directories/subdirectories are present and at this point, we are running "find $TARGET_DIR -iname "*.gz" -mtime +90 -print | xargs -n 1000 -P 5 rm -f {}" to delete the old files. Of course, it takes around 14 hours to just run/finish this command. Which brings me to my question, is there any way to speed up this process, at least even relatively quicker.
[21:44:17] <Soliton> brave to mix xargs and rm.
[21:44:31] <yitz> What's "jwz" stand for?
[21:44:44] <greycat> First note, if you're using GNU find, you can use -delete.  Otherwise, you want -exec rm -f {} +
[21:44:50] <lmat> shoham: you can skip the pipe and xargs. `find` has a parameter, -delete.

[22:03:55] <yitz> Filystyn: It can be proven that regex cannot parse HTML. One is context sensitive, the other context free.
[22:04:12] <yitz> And that theoretical proof tends to show up in practical ways
[22:04:27] <ormaaj> OnlineCop: Depends. Some tools do some surprising things like look at your stderr and guess that's your tty, such as tput. So if you want to emulate something exactly you would probably want to strace it and see what it is looking at.

[23:39:07] <twkm> that's mostly for incoming which doesn't help with deliverability.
[23:39:29] <N0ZYC> it keeps locking me out of sending from my scripts

[23:40:04] <N0ZYC> then it works for a month or three.  and locks me out again

[23:41:24] <N0ZYC> I've been using a twitchy Expect script that plays as politely as possible with their SMTP server
[23:41:41] <N0ZYC> waits for acks before sending next line.  programmed in delays, etc
