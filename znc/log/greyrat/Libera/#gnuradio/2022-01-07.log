[19:42:50] <ConnEcted[m]> hi guys, i have technical question about using gnuradio
[19:43:00] <ConnEcted[m]> hi, i have question, it's possible with gnu radio organize signal retranslation of GSM signal over internet?
[19:43:12] * ConnEcted[m] uploaded an image: (111KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GNTIcYvWvlxvGVJPnuaBypFV/image.png >
[19:43:15] <ConnEcted[m]> some like this
[19:43:50] <Yamakaja[m]> I'm happy to see you were planning to use a faraday cage :)
[19:44:01] <tnt> No
[19:44:05] <ConnEcted[m]> 🎉
[19:44:05] <Yamakaja[m]> But while in theory possible, this wont work because you wont be able to get the timing right
[19:44:56] <Yamakaja[m]> (I.e. you can capture and retransmit at a different location, but there is no way to meet the strict timing requirements imposed by mobile communications systems)
[19:45:10] <tnt> You'd have to put your relay at the LAPDm level rather than the RF level for it to work.
[19:46:03] <ConnEcted[m]> that is, if the delays are large, the phone will not be initialized on the remote network?
[19:46:42] <Yamakaja[m]> Conn Ected: Even if you place your device in the same room, the latencies introduced by software, network stacks, etc. make this unfeasible at the RF layer
[19:46:51] *** Joins: DaNeenjah (~jake@adsl-74-230-4-35.hsv.bellsouth.net)
[19:47:58] <ConnEcted[m]> GSM signal have strict latency? how about openbts? or fake GSM gateway
[19:48:10] <tnt> "large" being 115 us.  That's all the time you have to rx the signal, transmit it across the globe, tx it again on rx. Receive the response from the phone, transmit that back again across the globe and tx it again to the original cell.
[19:48:37] <tnt> This is baked into the GSM standard and how it works.
[19:49:31] <Hoernchen> those kind of delays do work if you modify the network side, but that's obviously impossible since you're not talking about your own network here.
[19:49:46] <ConnEcted[m]> i want to make gsm gateway as i understand, is impossible, thanks, but for another radio signal is not critical delay?
[19:49:51] <ConnEcted[m]> like 433 mhz
[19:49:56] <Yamakaja[m]> (For reference, that's 34 light km 
[19:49:59] <Yamakaja[m]> * light km )
[19:51:00] <Yamakaja[m]> Conn Ected: 433 MHz signals don't follow a single specification, it really depends on your application. on 433 MHz you'll commonly find unidirectional transmissions, so there'd be no problem with relaying those
[19:51:01] <tnt> yup, my bad, it's actually ~230 us because round trip.
[19:51:15] <ConnEcted[m]> another signal i can retransmit? like car signal from my keychan
[19:51:45] <Yamakaja[m]> Conn Ected: What are you trying to do here - this sounds like a solution in search of a problem :D
[19:51:52] <Hoernchen> most likely also expecting a maximum delay for security reasons to prevent car theft...
[19:52:33] <ConnEcted[m]> not car theft but, i saw video that tesla cars theft from signal retransmitors

[19:56:12] <Yamakaja[m]> Fyi, you can't use the rtl sdr to transmit signals
[19:56:21] <ConnEcted[m]> i want to make a radio signal monitor
[19:56:33] <ConnEcted[m]> Yamakaja[m]: i use raspberry to replay signal

[21:10:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> Indeed. You’re sampling noise that’s buried in noise. As long as your (often hundreds of MHz) bandwidth has no RFI in it you’re good.

[21:11:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> This is changing as there’s More RFi out there and bandwidths have gotten even larger.
