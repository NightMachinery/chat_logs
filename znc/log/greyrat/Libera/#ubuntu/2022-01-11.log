[03:43:53] <leftyfb> You added the PPA back and ran the ppa-purge command? Did it remove any packages ?
[03:44:23] <leftyfb> If it’s available via snap, go for it
[03:44:30] <bobdobbs> yep - I re-added the PPA files back into the sources.list.d directory, then did "apt-get update". Then did ppa-purge on them
[03:44:52] <bobdobbs> then did "apt-get update" again
[03:47:34] <bobdobbs> leftyfb: I'm gonna jump off channel for bit. I want to stop running emacs while I look into reinstalling it. But I'm using emacs as my irc client.

[04:55:05] <oerheks> no, i think it is an option hidden in the installer

[04:55:50] <figtree93> if I didnt go 22.04 daily now
[04:56:18] <sarnold> I think even 20.04 offers zfs in the desktop installer
[04:56:29] <oerheks> no, when LTS arrives, you would get the same packages, if any changes
[04:56:45] <figtree93> Oh right, he means I can use snapshot if its unstable or whatever... I'm with you now

[16:59:40] <jchittum> libraries and packages normally won't be in your homedir, but it'll copy your dot files, and most other basics. FWIW, the most basic backup tool that comes with Ubuntu is pretty good
[17:00:18] <Aim> I'm just aware that 20 will have new versions of software than the 18 ones I'm used to, and I don't want to commit to making the change right now.  Even just moving from emacs25 to a newer version would be hours of headache for me
[17:00:18] <movo> yes your homefolder should contain most of your dotfiles if you configured correctly.
[17:00:40] <jchittum> it's called "Backups" or "Deja Dupe" and is a frontend for `duplicity`. At its most basic it, it copies your homedir and keeps a registry of backups (and only copies deltas between the original copy)
[17:01:07] <jchittum> Aim: You can still reinstall to 18.04 if you wish then
[17:01:16] <jchittum> the installer is still available, and it is still supported

[21:05:19] <movo> i wonder too.. it might well apply to newer drivers.. but i see references to 32-bit libs in different sources. (like reddit). my steam (flatpak version) correctly detected the nouveau drivers but after installing nvidia-340 now it reports driver as Mesa/X.org llvmpipe (LLVM 12.0.1, 128 bits)
[21:05:21] <CoCo96> maybe i missed something, but it is required to install the linux firmwares and not enough to use the shipped admgpu from the linux kernel?

[23:21:12] <sarnold> Guest7348: it'll probably take some effort to figure out why exactly you're having problems; if the issue is CPU, you could 'nice' or 'renice' the browser, to give other processes a better shot at the cpu

[23:21:41] <sarnold> Guest7348: but if the browser is using so much memory that other processes are starved of memory and the system starts to swap, you'll need to do something else to restrict memory use of the browser
