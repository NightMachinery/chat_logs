[03:35:48] <uniquepointer> guys i ate taco bell last night
[03:46:02] <waleee> did Montezuma exact his revenge on you?
[03:46:35] <jmercouris> waleee: funny that you say that
[03:46:45] <jmercouris> That’s the library pierre is trying to integrate into Nyxt
[03:46:59] <jmercouris> It’s a text search library
[03:47:14] <waleee> (my knowledge of Taco Bell is that it famously incurs a bad stomach the day after)
[03:47:43] *** Quits: tekakutli (~user@201.141.16.196) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:48:16] <waleee> that was one epic port chain-description on cliki
[03:48:33] <waleee> circular even!
[03:49:10] <waleee> a missed oppurtunity not to name it oroburos
[03:49:25] <waleee> * ouroboros
[04:02:38] <jmercouris> Lol
[04:02:50] <jmercouris> Next time the author will be sure to do so
[04:03:01] <jmercouris> Taco Bell is fine
[04:03:07] <jmercouris> It’s just a meme that people complain
[04:03:23] <jmercouris> They get very drunk, eat Taco Bell and then wonder why they have stomach problems
[04:03:36] <jmercouris> Maybe because you were out late at night drinking lots of alcohol and didn’t sleep?
[04:03:47] <waleee> no one blames the drunk-kebab here
[04:03:57] <jmercouris> Yeah, they are weak eggs
[04:04:14] <jmercouris> Not sure if you have that expression in svenska
[04:04:15] <waleee> I assume that the odd döner in Germany wasn't blamed either
[04:04:24] <jmercouris> Nah, not blamed in Germany
[04:04:31] <jmercouris> I usually get a Turkish pizza though
[04:04:38] <waleee> in Swedish they would be kycklingar, chickens
[04:04:40] <jmercouris> And I get it plain
[04:04:50] <jmercouris> Ah like in English maybe
[04:04:58] <waleee> currywurst isn't drunk food?
[04:05:07] <jmercouris> Well they are usually closed
[04:05:15] <waleee> or other random asortment of wursts
[04:05:25] <jmercouris> Actually what you’ll have to do is wait until the next morning for a store to open
[04:05:31] <jmercouris> Things close very early in Berlin
[04:05:43] <jmercouris> But people will party until 5-6-7-8 AM
[04:05:59] <jmercouris> I don’t know why they are so extreme
[04:06:13] <jmercouris> In Chicago the bars close at 2AM which I’m kind of thankful for
[04:06:26] <jmercouris> Because I don’t have to ruin my sleep schedule
[04:06:49] <waleee> well, to be fair the drunk-kebab is a thing only in the larger cities or in the summertime when some restaurants in select summer hotspots has late opening hours
[04:06:54] <jmercouris> Though some places in chicago are grandfathered in to staying open until 4AM
[04:07:13] <jmercouris> Well, to be fair again, Berlin is the largest city in Germany!
[04:07:22] <waleee> * in Sweden
[04:07:24] <jmercouris> With a crazy party culture and an obnoxious amount of clubs
[04:07:38] <jmercouris> You would think they have more late night food options!
[04:07:49] <waleee> Sundays must be hell, aren't almost all stores closed?
[04:07:49] <jmercouris> Sometimes your only option is at the S Bahn
[04:07:55] <jmercouris> Yes everything is closed
[04:08:00] <jmercouris> Even pharmacy
[04:08:07] <waleee> (hell when you're hungover)
[04:08:08] <jmercouris> I’m sorry, did you get sick on a Sunday?
[04:08:10] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:08:14] <jmercouris> Well fuck you
[04:08:20] <jmercouris> You shouldn’t be sick on a Sunday
[04:08:33] <jmercouris> What’s that? You need some ingredient?
[04:08:55] <jmercouris> Ah well, you’ll have to drive 40 minutes to the nearest grocery store that is open
[04:09:01] <waleee> I think the local pharmacy where I live is closed on Sundays, but that isn't a general thing
[04:09:09] <jmercouris> It’s something I really hated about Germany
[04:09:15] <jmercouris> I did appreciate the silence of Sunday’s
[04:09:23] <jmercouris> But I did not appreciate the inconvenience
[04:09:36] <jmercouris> I also don’t miss the customer service
[04:09:55] <jmercouris> My woman was telling me today about some ticket checker on the train being a huge asshole to her
[04:10:10] <jmercouris> She never reacts, but she actually got angry enough to say somethin
[04:10:15] <jmercouris> I was really surprised
[04:11:16] <waleee> I'm continually suprised by how chirpy most of them are here, they get heaps of abuse by random fare skippers
[04:12:13] <jmercouris> Oh
[04:12:20] <jmercouris> That’s not a problem in Germany
[04:12:23] <jmercouris> It’s very rare
[04:12:35] <jmercouris> In fact did you know they don’t even have turnstiles?
[04:12:43] <jmercouris> You can just board any German train or bus
[04:12:49] <jmercouris> Which is crazy to me
[04:12:53] <jmercouris> No such thing in chicago
[04:12:53] <waleee> yeah I know that isn't a thing in Berlin
[04:13:13] <jmercouris> In Chicago no ticket checkers
[04:13:22] <jmercouris> Because the stations are locked and open with tickets
[04:13:32] <jmercouris> I would rather no ticket checkers and no lock
[04:13:38] <jmercouris> Public transit should just be free
[04:13:49] <jmercouris> It’ll probably save more money in the end
[04:14:51] <waleee> there was a couple of counties (communes) that tried it here, but they weren't famous for having super-comprehensive public transport
[04:15:27] <waleee> (like it lives about 20k people in the largest of them and it has a couple of buslines)
[04:16:09] <waleee> so I imagine that they didn't loose that much by people not paying the fare
[04:18:05] <waleee> re nyxt stuff, apparently there was one webkitgtk-version that had some issues (the one my distro uses until Monday/Tuesday) and caused crashes
[04:18:17] <jmercouris> Oh
[04:18:22] <jmercouris> So did you fix it?
[04:18:36] <jmercouris> By upgrading?
[04:19:07] <waleee> no, but I happened to check the irc-channel when the guy who owns that package mentioned he was doing upgrades on it
[04:19:36] <waleee> ... and upon inquiry he estimated that it would be rolled out early next week

[04:28:29] <jmercouris> Chicago is like 17 degree or so
[04:28:33] <jmercouris> Not super warm
[04:28:40] <jmercouris> But super warm for this time of year
[04:28:43] <jmercouris> It’s been pretty nice
[04:33:54] <jmercouris> Sveringe is a cold place
[04:35:19] <waleee> to be fair all of the US except Alaska is located on a latitude south of Spain
[04:36:42] <waleee> or rather (upon checking at the same latitude as Spain or below)
[04:39:53] <waleee> Stockholm is roughly on the same latitude as those islands in the inlet of Hudson bay
[04:42:38] <waleee> hm no some 3 degrees south

[20:49:53] <jmercouris> waleee: right, but the weather here gets far colder than spain
[20:49:58] <jmercouris> Like a lot colder than spain
[20:50:06] <jmercouris> We get -30s
[20:56:01] <waleee> mid-continent weather, love it :). But you have some perks like more sun in the winter
[20:56:26] <waleee> * than Germany and northwards
[20:56:54] <waleee> well, "sun". More daylight at least
[20:58:12] <xaltsc> Hey, I'm trying to create a toggle switch for the status bar, is there a function that forces it to reload ?
[21:05:33] <xaltsc>   (reload-buffers (list (status-buffer (current-window)))) works, but it also opens a new buffer
[21:08:52] <waleee> xaltsc: print-status?
[21:14:10] <xaltsc> waleee: you mean ffi-print-status ?
[21:16:27] <xaltsc> waleee: nyxt::print-status works, thx :)
[21:31:27] <jmercouris> waleee: yeah, definitely way more daylight
[21:31:30] <jmercouris> Like an hour more a day
