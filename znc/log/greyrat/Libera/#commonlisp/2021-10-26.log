[01:57:12] <mfiano> Sure. Anonymous classes are useful for implementing mixin systems
[01:57:57] <mfiano> I think dynamic-mixins uses this approach. stealth-mixin is a bit different and does not.

[01:59:04] <hayley> Stealth mixins are all "static", i.e. for some victim class C and some mixin M, all instances of C are instances of M.
[01:59:25] <mfiano> Right
[01:59:51] <mfiano> dynamic mixins is more like "create this anonymous class" and dynamically at runtime add/remove mixins to its superclasses
[01:59:54] <mfiano> "
[02:00:15] <mfiano> ugh i cant balance quotes without emacs
[02:03:34] <mfiano> I personally don't like dynamic-mixins because it assumes a hard-coded precedence ordering of mixins, which means for progn method combination you have to change the specificity for it to make sense (in my uses anyway), and in some cases I wanted a reversed CPL for some instances and not for others. I don't think it should enforce this design choice.
[02:04:24] <mfiano> The commit history shows it was swapped some time ago for "reasons"
[02:06:38] <mfiano> One day I would like to develop a useful (to me) mixin system for CL. There are some problems that have to be solved, such as initarg collisions.
[02:07:43] <mfiano> The obvious choice would be to use non-keyword interned initargs, but presenting this to the user would be "fun".

[14:42:00] <xaltsc> Hey, is it possible to use dolist with a list of functions ? doing (dolist (fun funlist) (fun arg)) doesn't work.
[14:42:56] <jackdaniel> xaltsc: (dolist (fun (funlist)) (funcall fun arg))
[14:43:42] <jackdaniel> functions and variables doesn't share the same namespace, so you need to pass the variable to this operator
[14:43:57] <jackdaniel> there is also apply for applying lists to the function
[14:45:48] <xaltsc> jackdaniel: do I need the surrounding parentheses around funlist ? I didn't know about funcall, I tried #'fun, but it didn't work either...
[14:46:42] <jackdaniel> no, that's my braino

[23:52:28] <pl> jackdaniel: ahhh, great
[23:52:52] <CodeBitCookie[m]> jackdaniel: True but can anyone suggested even in the ones I listed?

[23:53:46] <edgar-rft> CodeBitCookie[m]: Common Lisp GUI usually means using CAPI (Lispworks) or CLIM (Franz Inc.), and there is McClim, a free CLIM implementation.

[23:55:08] <jackdaniel> CodeBitCookie[m]: I can't recommend anything given problems you have encountered. I had a pleasent experience with ltk
[23:55:27] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Since this is aimed at newbies, which can only stand pretty GUIs. I don't think that McCLIM is ugly,  others do.
[23:55:28] <jackdaniel> but its documentation is lacking (i.e it has numerous widgets that are not present in the documentation)
[23:56:10] <CodeBitCookie[m]> jackdaniel: I have tried LTK but have heard and understood that it is not that viable for a bigger application. Maybe I am wrong?
[23:56:22] <jackdaniel> you can tell them that it is retro, not ugly ;)
[23:56:31] <edgar-rft> Newbies write bigger apps?
[23:56:56] <pl> CodeBitCookie[m]: is it really? A lot of stuff got done in Tcl/Tk
[23:57:06] <jackdaniel> or wave you hand and say: if you find it ugly you may easily theme it ,p
[23:57:06] <pl> I feel like "not viable for larger application" is C++ meme
[23:57:38] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Oh and another one was IUP. This one looked (and still looks?) interesting to me. That is actually pretty cool. I only encountered some problems with it. It has good docs too.
[23:58:13] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pl: Hmmm, Okay I am now looking into Tcl/Tk
[23:58:30] <pl> Ltk is essentially a thin wrapper around Tcl/Tk
[23:58:39] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pl: What about FLTK?
[23:58:52] <pl> I seem to recall it being C++
