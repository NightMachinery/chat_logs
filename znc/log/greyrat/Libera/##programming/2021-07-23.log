[00:00:31] <Izem> bool = True | False, not sure how else to interpret that :P
[00:00:42] <blahboybaz> I understand. The class is one function (it's constructor) and the methods in the class are each functions. I thought that mocking the part of the class excluding it's methods would allow me to test the methods that utilize those parts of the class definition as that method interacts with it. In other words, there is a part of the class (excluding methods) that contains simple fields. Some of the
[00:00:48] <blahboybaz> methods in the class utilize those fields to do what they do. So how would I test what a method that utilizes one of those fields without somehow mocking the field and being able to test what happens to the field compared to what happens in the method?
[00:01:27] <blahboybaz> As far as desing correctness or not I don't see any way to have a singly linked list without a head that points to the first item in the list or is empty.
[00:02:46] <blahboybaz> I thought that mocking the part of the
[00:03:33] <blahboybaz> excluding its methods <-- what I meant to say is - the part of the class you would get if you didn't consider the methods in it
[00:03:54] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: I think in this case you don't need to mock part of the object. You are fine treating the whole object as a black box

[00:04:48] <pyzozord> and just use it's public interface to check the correctness. Whatever happens inside is "implementation detail". It doesn't matter. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Or at least duck enough
[00:05:20] <W> Unit testing *can* involve testing the "internals" of something, if what that something does is just combine dependencies in a specific way, say, like a convenience class.
[00:07:16] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: I guess

[00:08:21] <pyzozord> W: in that case I think we would mock up all the dependencies, still treat the class as black box, and just check if it called/used the depedencies like we expect, right?
[00:08:53] <pyzozord> check by spying on the mocks
[00:10:25] <W> pyzozord, absolutely
[00:10:38] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: one ide just came to my mind is you could write a special subclass inside the test just for the testing, that way you could access it's private properties

[00:12:09] <blahboybaz> The only dependency is a very simple Node class with two filds in it (next and #data). But the interaction with that Node class happens in the List class and the new operator (ie: new Node();) is called from withing the List class. If you give me a moment I can share a concrete example referenceing actual code that might help it make more sense to me.

[00:23:02] <blahboybaz> https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x5ynvr3c  <--  Consider the createNode method which starts on line 66. In that method there is a conditional block lines 72 and 73. When the condition on line 70 is met, prev on line 72 will be this.#head (that's what getByIndex would have returned when the index is 0 (zero)). So when line 72 assigns new Node(); to prev it is assigning it to this.#head..  Question:
[00:23:08] <blahboybaz> wouldn't I want to compare the execution of line 70 (the case where the condition is met) with the actual value of ##head to see that it is assigned a new Node() ?

[00:32:52] <blahboybaz> What do you mean?
[00:33:02] <pyzozord> a single unit test doesn't need to test the entire unit, it can test only some properties/behaviors of that unit
[00:33:17] <pyzozord> functions are less complex units, so will probably require less tests then classes

[00:34:51] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: yeah I would think that too, but there are these hard lines in languages, so I guess you are forced to follow those lines, and most of what can be a unit is predetermined for you by the language

[02:14:00] <Twix> xyz1, you should avoid the system() function. But basically you would concatenate arguments into that string. Like int result; char buffer[50]; result = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "ls -al %s", myfolder); if (!(result < 0) && (result < sizeof(buffer)) { system(buffer);}
[02:14:23] <Twix> but you should use fork + execve

[02:16:25] <xyz1> okay. thank you
[02:17:36] <Twix> with execve you also do not need to concat a string to another one. You could consider this more easy

[02:18:43] <Twix> the problem with system() is, that it calls a shell to do the argument parsing. This leads to code execution bugs. If a user could control parts of what you give to system(), this user would gain code execution rights on your machine.

[13:10:07] <leorio> Arahael: They are useful, right?
[13:10:10] <pikapika> Even with the same exact model string, there can be several chipsets etc inside
[13:10:13] <pikapika> *different
[13:10:48] <deniska> leorio: memoizes a function
[13:10:49] <Arahael> leorio: Yes, because you can wrap functions, and describe how they're wrapped at the *top* of the function instead of the bottom.
[13:10:55] <pikapika> DarkTrick, its all a collusion between hardware manufacturers
[13:10:58] <pikapika> Its a bunch of bullshit
[13:11:31] <DarkTrick> pikapika, so if you're apple who control their own hardware, you can create much smaller OSs, right?
[13:11:33] <deniska> DarkTrick: depends. On linux you often have a single universal driver for wide variety of software, windows often comes with more granular vendor provided drivers
[13:11:40] <pikapika> DarkTrick, yes
[13:12:21] <moose> pikapika: Yes?
[13:12:24] <pikapika> Its all a conpsiracy between the hardware companies
[13:12:24] <deniska> DarkTrick: relatively speaking drivers are probably not that big compared to all the libraries and framework included for backwards compat
[13:12:29] <leorio> deniska: couldn't it be achieved by writing a function which actually takes another function as an argument and memoises them, like in Perl?
[13:12:33] <moose> You're pinging me in multiple channels and that's not very nice.
[13:12:41] <pikapika> leorio, it replaces the very function

[13:22:18] <pikapika> The natural state of any industry is price gouging, and hardware and audio are the worst offenders
[13:22:19] <Arahael> pikapika: Maybe inflation is finally catching up.  Back in the day, laptops are crazy expensive in real terms.
[13:22:22] <dan01> and if you try to move the window around it will lag
[13:22:25] <PlanckWalk> The end quality is probably worse, but the specs for a given price are getting *much* better over time.
[13:22:38] <pikapika> PlanckWalk, for example more and more you are getting "soldered" stuff
[13:22:41] <pikapika> Rather than screwed on
[13:22:43] <dan01> is this because IDLE is written in tkinter, and tckinter lacks hardware accelartion?

[13:22:57] <Arahael> pikapika: Soldered isn't neccessarily bad.
[13:23:11] <pikapika> Arahael, ok good luck when the part fails and you have to replace it
[13:23:25] <bihtori> Arahael: Pre-owned old business laptops would be a good fit for that but I'm not sure if the general public buy them, IT crowd and enthusiasts already know they're good bang for the buck but that's a minority.
[13:23:29] <deniska> leorio: not off the top of my head. There're annotations in java, but they do a different thing, although sometimes they're used for a similar purposes decorators can be used in python

[13:27:08] <pikapika> Yeah proper phones are cheaper today

[13:27:19] <pikapika> and features dropped

[13:27:56] <PlanckWalk> Most smartphones are flimsy pieces of crap because the margins are so thin that saving a couple of dollars is a large part of operating margin.
[13:28:31] <PlanckWalk> So everyone in the mass market saves that couple of dollars in manufacturing costs in a race to the bottom.
[13:28:59] <eyynet4> at least the cheap phones have headphone jacks
[13:29:17] <PlanckWalk> The rubbish is not a product of collusion.  It's a product of competition and consumers who don't care as much about quality as they claim to.

[13:48:43] <pikapika> Arahael, I was referring to android dev
[13:48:49] <Arahael> Andriod Studio does use Java.
[13:49:04] <pikapika> ie the huge size and insane number of files in a fresh project folder
[13:49:18] <pikapika> actually the size is alright
[13:49:24] <pikapika> which makes the file count all the more insane

[13:53:29] <death916> haha i know right
[13:53:36] <pikapika> Not that more cores should be free reign to allow you their use

[15:25:25] <Rashad> I making a request to some REST API in my Java code, and there are multiple scenarios in which the whole thing needs to stop and an error message is displayed to the user.
[15:25:32] <Rashad> For example, when the request times out.
[15:25:56] <Rashad> But there are also situations about the data not making sense, or that the query parameters returned no data.
[15:26:46] <Rashad> I've handled the ones like request timeout with throwing an exception and when catching it making sure I display a message to the user, etc.
[15:27:18] <Rashad> But now I am tempted to also throw a "NoDataForThisDocumentNumber" exception sort of thing
[15:27:39] <Rashad> It's not exactly an "error" it is just that there is no data... if that makes sense.
[15:27:57] <Rashad> So should I do that or should I just display the error message and `return` from wherever I was?
[15:27:59] <david_hilbert> Why do you need an exception for that?
[15:28:13] <Rashad> david_hilbert I don't know
[15:28:18] <david_hilbert> If a method isn't meant to return any data, then you don't display any data to the user. Simple.
[15:28:41] <Rashad> Oh well this is happening in the background.
[15:29:01] <Rashad> The user doesn't see any data anyway, just that the operation was a success or that some error happened.
[15:31:03] <Rashad> I can do it syntactically either way but is it "usual" or _expected_ if you read someone else's code to find such an error as "query returned 0 results, when it should have returned at least 1" being defined as an exception?

[17:06:45] <Rashad> I am using Java, and I am calling `new JSONObject(myString);` from a library which can throw a JSONException. For some reason I am not being asked to handle such exception.
[17:07:11] <pulse> LyX seems nice
[17:07:20] <Rashad> In fact, I actually want the language to explicitly force the exception handling.
[17:07:20] <Arahael> pulse: Yeah, I used it back in the day for notetaking at uni
[17:07:44] <bay_area_thrash> Arahael, I used paper for note taking

[17:33:02] <bay_area_thrash> Arahael, in ancient times it meany synthetic geometry...today I'd say anything that is more based on the forms and spatial properties of objects
[17:33:05] <Arahael> bay_area_thrash: I didn't learn them with that terminology.
[17:33:12] <pulse> no love for topology :(
[17:33:14] <bay_area_thrash> Whereas algebra today feels the more synthetic
[17:33:41] <Arahael> pulse: I did conic sections in highschool!
[17:33:49] <bay_area_thrash> Algebra would be anything where you have a set of objects and some simple rules to manipulate them, and then a very rich structure emerges from these very small sets of properties
[17:34:02] <pulse> topology and set theory are imo the most important branches
[17:34:05] <pulse> and statistics
[17:34:06] <bay_area_thrash> I think conic sections is called "analytic geometry"
[17:34:14] <bay_area_thrash> Thats a different subject from algebraic geometry

[18:00:15] <beaky> also i like 2 spaces indent
[18:00:29] <beaky> soon i will experiment with a single-space indent style
[18:00:52] <pyzozord> I don't think an exception is necessary at all

[18:02:36] <beaky> what is wrong with single space indent
[18:02:52] <pyzozord> not many people use it
[18:03:03] <beaky> ok i guess im going to have to stick to two-space indent

[18:03:36] <pyzozord> other then that it's the same old spaces vs tabs arguments. Mint vs Chamomile

[18:04:14] <pyzozord> but popularity of tech does seem to have serious impact of the available talent pool
[18:04:19] <deniska> beaky: no, I mean there's unicode character called "zero width space"
[18:04:49] <deniska> it's whitespace, technically
[18:04:56] <pyzozord> deniska: oh that's evil

[18:14:15] <Rashad> around that code is other code that does things like: `var response = request(params);` where `request` can throw errors and I do surround them with try and catch
[18:14:56] <Rashad> But the "isValid(response);` method returns true or false rather than throw something -- I don't know how it would make sense for such a thing to throw an error.
[18:15:34] <Rashad> I could change it to `validate(response)` which would make more sense, and not having to return a true or false -- just throwing the error if it is invalid
[18:15:36] <curdlesnoot> what stops you from implementing, say, a throwing validateResponse method, then making that the subject of the try block? it's not as though you can't re-use isValid to that end.

[18:16:05] <Rashad> curdlesnoot Yeah that's what I was thinking

[22:43:24] <arkanoid> is there a programming language capable of automatically take advantage of multicore arichitectures without explicit handling?
[22:43:27] <pyzozord> Guest41: depends on your contract, check it very carefully. Usually companies phrase contracts in such way that they can get away with as much as possible. Even if it's against the contract your only options would be to a) intimidate your manager with legal action b) carry out the legal action c) quit your job. A) and b) get you fired sooner or later.
[22:44:16] <pyzozord> Guest41: your real options are 1) keep your head down and endure 2) quit your job 3) sue them (if it really is against the contract)

[22:47:48] <kurapika_> pikapika: they might shorten it to that sometimes. but Salam isn't a Persian word anyway.
[22:48:11] <GeDaMo> There are things like OpenMP where you can say "parallelize this loop"

[22:48:38] <GeDaMo> And there are array languages which can take advantage of vector processing

[22:55:41] <arkanoid> programming in dask basically you declare a graph of computations rooted in array programming, then it splits all that graphs over the clusters and you get work done
[22:56:30] <arkanoid> GeDaMo: yes, that count, but programming new functions requires explicit handling anyway
