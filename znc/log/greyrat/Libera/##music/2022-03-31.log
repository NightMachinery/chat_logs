[16:53:40] <macrobat> key is the centre note
[16:53:49] <artao> sure
[16:54:14] <macrobat> 6 flats = 6 sharps = Gb/F#
[16:54:15] <artao> i get that now, but i was never taught it in school
[16:54:40] <artao> i used to know the order of flats too, cuz they always get added in the same order
[16:54:45] <artao> ....... which i now realize isn't true
[16:55:05] <artao> depends on the scale/mode
[16:55:08] <sublim20> just play power chords

[18:48:29] <artao> i never meant to go "only" Arturia, it's just they have some great value products
[18:48:49] <artao> they're kinda almost "ignoring" the KSP tho :\
[18:49:07] <artao> pushing the freakin KeyStep 37 harder than the KeyStep Pro
[18:49:18] <artao> they definitely made some mis-steps with the KSP
[18:49:29] <artao> and still haven't fully implemented some promised features
[18:49:58] <artao> i'm personally quite annoyed that the sequencers don't record pitch bend, mod wheel, or aftertouch
[18:50:00] <artao> like, wtf
[18:50:39] <artao> not to mention the CC from the 5 knobs. there's only one universal "control track" that allows you to use the 5 knobs for CC. only 1 track at a time. and it can't be recording
[18:50:49] <artao> it's not like MIDI data takes up much fucking space
[18:50:52] <artao> most of it is only 8-bit
[18:51:06] <artao> aftertouch (and mod wheel?) is apparently 14-bit
[18:51:08] <artao> but still
[18:51:22] <artao> we're talking kilobytes here, not megabytes
[18:51:23] <artao> wtaf
[18:51:31] <artao> how much memory is in this thing anyhow?
[18:51:56] <artao> but then there's the people that complain they can't record enough
[18:52:04] <artao> 16 patterns with up to 64 steps each
[18:52:16] <artao> which can be chained, in up to 16 segments
[18:52:19] <artao> but that's not enough?
[18:52:20] <artao> wtaf
[18:52:34] <artao> it's meant to be a live performance instrument, not a studio workstation
[18:52:46] <FreeRangeDillo> I was looking at the KeyLab MKII a while back.  Looked pretty nice, and it comes with a pre-programmed command set for my DAW
[18:53:03] <artao> nice
[18:53:13] <artao> and it comes with analog lab. and i assure you, it's damn nice
[18:53:34] <FreeRangeDillo> I've played with a demo of Analog Lab
[18:53:40] <artao> tho over the years they've reduced the number of sounds that came with it
[18:53:43] <FreeRangeDillo> limited features, but nice sounds
[18:53:47] <artao> when i first got it it had like 2000 sounds
[18:53:55] <artao> now i think it might even be under 1000
[18:54:09] <artao> or that might be the light version, which they didn't use to have either
[18:54:20] <artao> i do NOT like their new preset browsing system tho
[18:54:28] <artao> whoever came up with that needs a good slapping
[18:54:32] <FreeRangeDillo> haha
[18:54:45] <artao> considerably slower than the previous version
[18:54:57] <artao> previously all the tags and categories were in a left-side bar
[18:55:13] <artao> NOW you have to click on the headings in the list to change those filters
[18:55:22] <artao> you can't see all of them at once either
[18:55:42] <artao> like .... wtf. who thought that was a good idea? there's still a left-side bar. which has FAR FAR less usage
[18:56:09] <artao> i made a post about it on their forums but it hasn't yet gained any tracktion
[18:56:41] <artao> another sucky thing is not being able to transfer presets from older versions of instruments to newer versions
[18:56:56] <artao> if the engine gets an update that is
[18:57:07] <FreeRangeDillo> that's not good
[18:57:11] <artao> usually the engine stays the same
[18:57:16] <artao> yeah. annoying
[18:57:24] <artao> they first did it with the Mini Moog
[18:57:33] <artao> people were so upset they released a tool to convert presets
[18:57:34] <artao> LOL
[18:57:37] <artao> it was hit or miss
[18:57:52] <artao> largely cuz the engine is QUITE different in some ways
[18:58:00] <artao> presets just don't sound the same
[18:58:20] <artao> The just gave that for free, as a normal update
[18:59:39] <artao> NOW tho? In v8 they updated the engine for the Jupiter 8 and Rhodes electric piano
[18:59:46] <artao> BUT! they're making us pay for that
[19:00:12] <artao> when i first got it was v4 .... they even once added several brand new instruments for free!!
[19:00:16] <artao> now? nope. never
[19:00:17] <artao> wtaf
[19:00:21] <artao> <sigh> oh well
[19:00:26] <artao> gotta make that dough eh
[19:00:33] <artao> not that they're hurting for profit

[20:09:26] <artao> 6 nieces i think?
[20:09:27] <macrobat> it is so dumb. maybe the point is that it encourages a modicum of acting to convince the easily led audience there are family ties
[20:09:37] <artao> ranging from like 1.5 yrs to .... 14? 13?
[20:10:03] <artao> nah. porn is pretty much always just fantasy
[20:10:05] <labrador> macrobat, i might have a lil problem

[20:10:21] <labrador> I don't really have a sister,nor do I like incest porn
[20:10:36] <labrador> I just don't understand the knee jerk reaction people have to actual incest
[20:10:47] <labrador> I think its normal
[20:10:55] <artao> yeah
[20:10:56] <artao> i dunno
[20:11:06] <artao> i dunno about "normal" tho. it depends where you live
[20:11:09] <labrador> Like i don't get what people find so yucky about it
[20:11:24] <labrador> Its basically "whatever you do you" for me
[20:11:26] <artao> it seems more "normal" in east europe
[20:11:33] <artao> u.s. is very frown upon
[20:11:51] <labrador> and I can't see a reason
[20:11:53] <artao> and it's almost always step sister. and that doesn't matter then. not actually incest
[20:11:56] <labrador> Like really

[20:13:18] <labrador> They'll turn out disfigured
[20:13:35] <artao> the Emulator II is perhaps the synth i'm most excited about with V Collection 8
[20:13:59] <artao> the Vocoder, SQ-80, and CZ are also pretty sweet tho
[20:14:03] <artao> the other 4? eh
[20:14:48] <artao> OB-Xa. Synthi, Melotron, Juno 6 (meh), and Jupiter 8 (which i already have the old version of)
[20:15:07] <artao> but FINALLY only $12.50usd each
[20:15:18] <artao> $99 for the upgrade from 6 to 8
[20:15:28] <artao> which most likely means 9 is just around the corner LOL
[20:15:56] <artao> with arturia, updating v collection every 2 versions, waiting on the "special" promotional offer, is the best deal
[20:16:07] <artao> new users get the collection for about 22.50 per instrument
[20:16:24] <artao> the normal upgrade price for prior customers is about 25 per instrument

[20:29:21] <artao> microphone question
[20:29:45] <artao> this Shure SM57 has QUITE low input levels ..... unless mic-ed VERY close
[20:30:06] <artao> i have my Behringer mixer, with its Onyx pre-amps
[20:30:17] <artao> and i have my focusrite scarlett audio interface
[20:30:42] <artao> the mixer definitely has a high noise floor. the focusrite far lower
[20:31:08] <artao> but if i run the mic direct into the focusrite the DAW input level is ridicu-low, even with high audio interface gain
[20:31:32] <artao> if i run it thru the mixer's onyx pre-amp then into the focusrite, it's noisier
[20:32:00] <artao> not entirely sure what my "question" is ......... i guess .......... I dunno
[20:32:04] <artao> which way would YOU go?
[20:32:47] <artao> focusrite pre-amp only, then up the gain in the DAW? or also use the behringer pre-amp into the focusrite? it gives a much higher level
[20:33:09] <artao> i can set the combination levels such that the Onyx pre-amp noise isn't really noticeable at all
[20:33:28] <artao> but still. going thru 2 pre-amps? surely that'situation

[20:53:31] <Cale> Um, I'm not sure that's true. Any floating point format should be capable of representing much larger amplitudes than are remotely reasonable for audio.
[20:54:54] <edk> 24-bit fixed point is already capable of representing much larger amplitudes than are remotely reasonable for audio
[20:55:25] <Cale> Yeah, probably... depends on where the fixed point is :)
[20:55:43] <edk> and it's also closer to how most audio ADCs and DACs work
[20:56:47] <edk> it's impractically expensive to make them accurate to the lowest bit with even the 24 bits of precision they already have
[20:56:55] <edk> so adding more would be pointless

[23:29:02] <artao> there are variances

[23:29:38] <LibertyDillo> I'm not seeing how it's 'impossible' to overdrive 32-bit

[23:29:58] <artao> VERY rare, if ever
[23:30:24] <artao> 24 bit float is virtually meaningless frankly

[23:41:27] <morf> s/music/corn/
[23:41:28] <Janet> morf thinks artao meant to say: IDK why, but a LOT of tms when I link my corn to people, they choose to listen to the Long Form category
[23:41:28] <artao> um
[23:41:51] <morf> meh probably should replace some other line 
[23:41:57] <artao> exactly
[23:42:04] <morf> sorry

[23:42:35] <macrobat> what's the most fun u've had w regex?
[23:43:00] <artao> LOL
[23:43:08] <artao> not possible
[23:43:28] <artao> there is NO situation where regex is "fun"
[23:43:42] <artao> trick question
[23:43:45] <morf> well probably writing some horrible regular expression parsing some crazy shit 
[23:43:56] <morf> it was "fun"
[23:43:59] <artao> ViM or EMACS
[23:44:17] <artao> regex 
[23:44:19] <artao> woot
[23:44:30] <macrobat> knuckletats: EMAC SVIM
[23:45:21] <artao> regex is incapable of dealing with music related issues
[23:45:45] *** voltage is now known as voltage_
[23:45:49] <macrobat> they should invent musical matching patterns

[23:47:19] <macrobat> it's true what they say: once you've started a modal editor, you won't be able to quit
[23:47:28] <artao> corn at the store RN is prolly from Mexco
[23:47:53] <artao> and Mexico can fuck off
[23:48:17] <artao> one of The Most Fucked counries in the world
