[00:03:27] <somiaj> so you want the arc length of the "circle" ||x-x0|| = 1 to be 2pi = 8
[00:04:04] <CarloWood> I have a directional graph with 110 nodes. Each node is either black or white. Each black node only has edges, if any, to white nodes. Each white node only has edges to black nodes. Each node is also marked with B, W or nothing(?) (at the start of the algorithm all nodes are unmarked). If a node of color K has no edges (if any) other than nodes that are marked with W if K is black or B if K is white then that node should be
[00:04:04] <CarloWood> marked with that mark (W if K is black and B if K is white). Find an algorithm that marks as many nodes as possible.

[04:08:24] <Guest78> also, prime ideals meaning the ideal has a single (Grobner) basis element?
[04:08:27] <kakuhen> a series of prime ideals ordered by strict inclusion
[04:08:36] <kakuhen> unless you meant find a chain of primes in this ring
[04:08:49] <kakuhen> which in case I know we have at least (0) ⊆ (x,y,z)

[04:11:41] <Guest78> hm, weird. My book doesn't talk about what Krull dimension is
[04:12:51] <kakuhen> well I sort of convinced myself how (x,y,z) could possibly have dimension 0
[04:13:08] <kakuhen> my ideal kind of forces y=z=0, and x may freely vary; that's why we have krull dimension 1 in Q[x,y,z]/I

[04:13:43] <kakuhen> so we don't have much choice for a chain of primes in (x,y,z) besides, like, (x) itself
[04:14:06] <kakuhen> ok I convinced myself M2 is likely correct
[04:14:22] <Guest78> I'm like 10 steps behind you, fyi, so I'm not gonna be any help :P
[04:14:22] <Guest78> Glad you seem to have got a handle on it though
[04:14:31] <kakuhen> yeah, this ring is just weird
[04:14:43] <kakuhen> basically I went very carefully what equations the ideal forces on my ring
[04:14:53] <kakuhen> from there i got the dimension of Q[x,y,z]/I

[04:16:02] <kakuhen> and after seeing what y and z are effectively in this ring, you end up seeing that m = (x,y,z) only has (x) as a prime, since adding anything else to the ideal will give you (x) back
[04:17:02] <kakuhen> oh actually just kidding I wasn't even following my own work properly. I was computing dimension of m/m^2

[04:20:11] <Guest78> here is a question, from the ideal-variety correspondence theorem, if we can bound the dimension of the variety then does that mean the Krull dimension of the ideal is also bounded?

[08:48:59] <droid3> curious i know that for rational tangles there is a unique canonical continued fraction representation for it. Usually we term it conways notation sometimes leaving out the [ , which me personally thing is bad convention.
[08:49:51] <droid3> so [3,1,1]  is better / more understandable then 311
[08:50:46] <droid3> But regardless the question i have is this
[08:51:25] <droid3> For a given Knot that cannot be represented by a rational tangle.

[08:51:45] <droid3> Usually we can represent it by a connected sum of rational tangles
[08:52:14] <droid3> However i am not sure if this can be done for the complete class of all knots and all links???
[08:53:00] <droid3> Is the connected sum of rational tangles in some sense the same as what braids can do???
[08:53:40] <droid3> We know that all knots and links can be made from braid words.
[08:53:53] <droid3> I can prove this
[08:54:24] <droid3> But i cant see away of a proof or if it is true that all knots and links
[08:55:10] <droid3> can be represented by a connected sum of rational tangles.
[08:56:35] <droid3> sure we can proof that rational tangles and rational knots can be uniquely described by there fraction.

[08:57:19] <droid3> however i am  banging my head over if we can extend the theory to all knots and links with a connected sum of rational tangles.
[08:58:17] <droid3> Certainly the fractions wont be unique at this point. So it wont extend to a complete invariant if we widen are set from the rational knots to knots/links in general.
[08:59:02] <droid3> But my issue is can we always construct a knot/link of any kind from a connected some of rational tangles regardless of if the sum of the rational numbers makes any sense.
[08:59:56] <droid3> And i believe we just be weakening the complete invariant to an invariant that not complete even if we could make sense of this invariant.

[09:26:56] <sjue> I want to solve this system of odes by changing coordinates to polar
[09:28:15] <sjue> and after I change into polar coordinate, I get r'cosθ-rθ'sinθ=r^3sinθ, r'sinθ+rθ'cosθ=-r^3cosθ
[09:30:25] <sjue> then I add these two terms and multiply it by r and I get, rr'(cosθ+sinθ)+r^2θ'(cosθ-sinθ)=r^4(sinθ-cosθ)
[09:31:17] <sjue> my idea is to subsitute into rr' and r^2θ', but it doesn't seem it simplifies this equation. Are my steps incorrect?

[11:03:38] <droid3> I got another curiosity i have seen recently. That for n-braids where n >=5 that the burau matrix group is not faithful. Where as we know that 2-braids and 3-braids have a complete burau group matrix invariant.
[11:04:33] <droid3> But what happened to 4-braids its like we skipped them. I have a neat proof of the 2-braids and 3-braids.
[11:05:50] <droid3> And i believe that how there proving the unfaithfulness of n>=5 is just be computer enumeration finding a nontrivial knot that has the same matrix as the unknot.

[11:07:49] <droid3> would have been nice for a complete invariant on n-braids :( But you still can do alot with 2 and 3 braids.
[11:08:48] <droid3> Also the other issue is my program is slow as shit is there any notation the distinguishes  mirror knots ?
[11:09:11] <droid3> I mean i can use the jones polynomial to some what distinguish

[11:10:13] <droid3> However this is a case by case thing. Its not like i can find a notation equivalent to dowker notation that a computer can understand that distinguishes between mirror knots.

[11:13:21] <droid3> dowker notation is still the best way to represent knots in a computer form for a computer to me so far. Unless anybody got a better way. Conways notations good but more for rational tangles/tangle things not as good for a computer representation.

[13:28:34] <diophantoz> however, that seems to lead me wrong. someone suggested i treated a = 1k, b = 6k and plug those into a^2 + b^2 = 7^2

[14:15:47] <PlanckWalk> biberao: Yep!
[14:16:04] <diophantoz> a/b = 1/2 => a = 1b/6

[14:16:33] <PlanckWalk> diophantoz: I thought the hypotenuse (c) was 7?
[14:16:43] <diophantoz> oh right
[14:16:47] <diophantoz> it is
[14:16:58] <biberao> about the coordinates of C like you mentioned before we determine P(3,f(3)) then C(x+f(3),f(3))

[14:28:16] <PlanckWalk> r(theta) = 1
[14:28:48] <PlanckWalk> Some even have infinitely many loops
[14:30:18] <[-_-]> Then what is the secrect to solving polar intgrations?
[14:30:34] <[-_-]> During exams I may not know what the given functions look like
[14:30:57] * [-_-] going mad
[14:31:35] <diophantoz> hmm, now i get b = 1
[14:32:18] <PlanckWalk> [-_-]: In this example you can tell that it has *at most* two loops
[14:32:19] <diophantoz> no, probably not right
[14:32:21] <biberao> doesnt it require a d0
[14:32:24] <biberao> or something
[14:32:37] <biberao> i remember there are certain polar replacements or something
[14:32:53] <[-_-]> I can
[14:33:05] <[-_-]> But I need to know where f(theta) becomes zero
[14:33:13] <[-_-]> 3 zeros in one period
[14:33:16] <[-_-]> I know two
[14:33:41] <[-_-]> it seems the other one is pi+-arcsin(2/3)
[14:33:43] <PlanckWalk> 2 - 3 sin(theta)  iff  sin(theta) = 2/3
[14:33:45] <[-_-]> lemme try that
[14:34:10] <PlanckWalk> In the range [0, 2pi) there are only two values of theta satisfying that
[14:34:31] <[-_-]> yeah
[14:34:58] <PlanckWalk> You may remember from trig that sin(x) = sin(pi - x)  for all x.
[14:35:21] <PlanckWalk> So obviously one solution is arcsin(2/3), and that identity gives pi - arcsin(2/3) as another solution.
[14:37:05] <[-_-]> ah...that is the answer PlanckWalk
[14:37:15] * [-_-] loves this place
[14:37:19] <biberao> [-_-]: you need to learn your trig circle :D
[14:37:24] <[-_-]> :D
[14:38:06] <biberao> cos is negative cos(pi-x)
[14:38:07] <biberao> :p
[14:38:26] <PlanckWalk> diophantoz: (b/6)^2 + b^2 = b^2 (1/6)^2 + b^2 = b^2 ((1/6)^2 + 1)
[14:38:45] <diophantoz> PlanckWalk, b = 6 ?
[14:38:52] <PlanckWalk> No
[14:39:06] <PlanckWalk> b=6 is not a solution to  7^2 = (b/6)^2 + b^2
[14:39:18] <johnkeats6> hi
[14:40:33] <diophantoz> hmm, i thought i could squareroot 7^2 = (b/6)^2 + b^2 => 7 = (b/6) + b, then get b from that
[14:40:41] <biberao> need to print more pages of books :\
[14:41:18] <diophantoz> using (b/6)+(b/1)
[14:41:36] <PlanckWalk> diophantoz: Squaring doesn't work like that
[14:41:58] <PlanckWalk> It's not true that  ((b/6) + b)^2 = (b/6)^2 + b^2
[14:42:56] <PlanckWalk> (b/6)^2 + b^2 = b^2 (37/36)
[14:43:17] <PlanckWalk> So 7 = b sqrt(37)/6

[22:46:25] <Panther> For one thing, taking the log can make the equation linear, so the graph is a straight line.
[22:47:03] <Panther> Then, of course you have to recall that you took a log if, for example you want to interpret the slope.
[22:48:59] <johnkeats6> Guest7829, lots of things work depending on order of magnitude, so if you only care about what order of magnitude some variable is basically you're taking a log
[22:50:01] <brheurhe> how do you prove that the eqn x²-xsin(x)-cos(x) = 0 can't have more than 2 solutions?
[22:50:17] <Panther> Yep, like sound pressure in dB

[22:53:38] <Panther> x²-xsin(x)-cos(x) = 0 is basically a quadratic in x, despite the sin and cos, since |sin(x)| and |cos(x)| are both <= 1.

[22:56:22] <Panther> It is certainly asymptotically quadratic.
[22:57:13] <Panther> Because of that bound.
[22:57:17] <somiaj> Guest7829: also in terms of 'best fit curves', there is a lot of tools and ways to find the best fit line (linear regression), so if you can create a scale which makes data linear,  you can then find the best fit line, and then undo the scale to get a good approximation

[22:58:06] <somiaj> Panther: depends on your definitions, but one is if lim x->inf f(x)/x^2 = L != 0, then the function grows like x^2
[22:58:21] <somiaj> and it should be fairly clear that the limit of your function divided by x^2 is just 1

[23:00:32] <Panther> What you said is applicable, tho.
[23:00:44] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[23:01:14] <somiaj> brheurhe: One way is to use calculus, f(x) = x^2 - x*sin(x) - cos(x), then f'(x) = 2x - xcos(x) = x(2 - cos(x)), has exactly one solution x=0. So so since it only has one critical point and the function is continous, f(x) can cross any horiztonal line at most 2 times.

[23:02:17] * Panther nods, since 2-cos(x) can never be 0.
[23:02:52] <somiaj> Panther: yea, though something that is asymptotically quadratic could have lots of zeros, since that only cares about the tail ends
[23:04:14] <somiaj> though putting it all together, f(0) = -1, and lim x->+-inf f(x) = inf, so you know it crosses the x-axis at least two times, previous argument, at most two solutions, so exactly two.
[23:05:16] <Panther> In general, yep, tho this wouldn't have to go much past the bounds of those functions before the contributions of the trig terms would be inconsequential.

[23:08:54] <Panther> I think, somiaj, your solution is a lot clearer, and probably what whoever made that problem was looking for. :)
[23:09:16] <somiaj> Yea, though nice to start with intuitution, then formalize it
[23:09:29] <somiaj> so it is basically a quadratic, then think about what properites of that you can use to prove it
