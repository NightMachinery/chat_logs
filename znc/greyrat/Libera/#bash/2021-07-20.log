[00:00:03] <lantech19446> holy shit that's a lot of regex
[00:00:12] <yitz> If it is a regular file, it can be served over HTTP or copied via SCP
[00:01:04] <lantech19446> how would i serve it over http
[00:01:28] <greycat> Figure out what your web server's DocumentRoot (or equivalent) is, and maybe it's already there.
[00:01:41] <greycat> Just, like, http://10.0.0.1/report.html or something.
[00:01:42] <yitz> Tell Apache or Nginx to serve files from that directory for some endpoint
[00:02:09] <greycat> If /var/www/html/ is outside of the Document Root of every virtual host on your web server, set up a new one.
[00:02:31] <yitz> Or even that Python module that lets you serve a dir on a port with a simple command
[00:02:53] <lantech19446> if it comes down to that i'll do it via scp I'm not a web designer I built the server itself but i don't get the workings when it comes to lamp
[00:03:19] <greycat> Which web server software is it?  Do you use virtual hosts, or is it all just one host?
[00:03:27] <lantech19446> lamp
[00:03:46] <lantech19446> I didn't setup the page on it so I'm really not sure but i think there's at least one vhost
[00:03:55] <greycat> So, apache httpd?  You should be able to find DocumentRoot in /etc/apache2/* or wherever your configs are.
[00:04:17] <yitz> You might be able to just copy that report.html into another docroot
[00:04:45] <greycat> or hard-link it, etc.
[00:05:24] <lantech19446> nothing at all inside apache2.conf gonna look at sites-available

[01:01:29] <rud0lf> less overhead? better compatibility? simpler?
[01:02:04] <greycat> The usual reason is that the script needs to run on many different systems, which will definitely have bash, and may not have python or perl or ruby or whatever.

[01:24:04] <earnestly> rud0lf: Most scripts and programs tend to be glorfied shell scripts, expending immence amounts of boilerplate to do what a shell does implicitly.  But none of this matters; you have to use what you know and if learning things like the shell is too onerous or uninteresting, don't waste your time and everyone elses with bad shell scripts (there's too many of them already)
[01:26:23] <earnestly> The portability argument is a bit so-so because most shell scripts run commands and those commands vary across systems.  Most languages like to be as hermetic as possible
[01:26:59] <earnestly> E.g. With python you can use a Path object and it'll justworkâ„¢ on whatever system python supports

[13:52:17] <fling> Can't do this ^ There is a lot of stuff happening and hosts_ok+=("$host") in the end
[13:52:42] <fling> so if something continue before this line then the host does not get into the array
[13:53:12] <geirha> same deal. If it won't reach hosts_ok+=( "$host" ), append it to hosts_ko instead
[13:54:17] <fling> but how to check if it did not reach hosts_ok? :D haha
[13:54:47] <geirha> you run continue, right? so hosts_ko+=( "$host" ); continue

[13:58:56] <fling> had to replace || continue with ifs
[14:00:05] <Soliton> || { hosts_ko+=( "$host" ); continue; }  but an if may be more readable anyway.
[14:01:06] <fling> sneaky
[14:03:27] <geirha> antother option is to unset the entry for hosts whenever you append to hosts_ok. That will effectively make hosts into hosts_ko after the loop
[14:04:24] <geirha> for i in "${!hosts[@]}"; do host=${hosts[i]}; ... || continue; unset -v 'hosts[i]'; hosts_ok+=( "$host" ); done

[23:23:59] <Izem> I am experimenting with bash redirection, it should be possible to download a html page with the special tcp files right?
[23:24:42] <twkm> yes, somewhat.  better to use an http client.

[23:25:51] <twkm> (i was just writing that, but using 9 as is my habit)
[23:26:08] <Izem> is >&2 the same as 1>&2 ?
[23:27:07] <Inline> no
[23:27:10] <Inline> why should it ?
[23:27:21] <Inline> 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr
[23:27:21] <twkm> 1 is assumed when there's no number before the > -- as per the redirection section of the documentation.
[23:27:56] <Inline> is that with the case of a lone > or in combination with other numbers ?
[23:27:57] <twkm> (and 0 is assumed for < if there's no number before the symbol)
[23:28:01] <Izem> hmm, that exec command sure looks interesting
[23:28:39] <Inline> yah, so it all boils down to if that also holds for the composite cases
[23:29:06] <Inline> echo "blah" > file writes it to the file so you know that 1 was redirected to a file handle
[23:29:23] <Izem> it makes sense that it is open for reading and writing, but for some reason I thought you would not have to do that.
[23:29:31] <twkm> the key there is that fd 1, stdout, is closed when echo is done.
[23:29:49] <twkm> with exec the redirection is permanent.
[23:29:54] <Izem> This is because for http it is on one tcp connection I think
[23:30:01] *** Quits: AnAverageHuman (~AnAverage@user/anaveragehuman) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[23:30:34] <twkm> you must do that, after all you want to write the GET and read the result, so two-way.
[23:31:13] <Izem> iirc, are you not supposed to use fds >= 10?
[23:31:26] <Izem> because bash may use some other ones internally?
[23:32:17] <Izem> cool, this is pretty mind blowing stuff
[23:32:36] <twkm> you can have bash allocate the fd itself and assign that value to a variable.  exec {s}<>/dev/tcp/...
[23:32:38] <Izem> Now I just need to understand want duplication is :D
[23:33:12] <Izem> yeah, good idea
[23:34:21] <twkm> printf writes to stdout.  in geirha's example you direct stdout to the socket, fd 3 -- change the reference for 1 to what 3 currently is then run the command.
