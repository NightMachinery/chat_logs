[11:17:25] <sandra> jeaye: Thank you!
[11:17:39] <sandra> So it does suppress namespace resolution
[11:18:58] <jeaye> Yeah. ~ means "evaluate now" and, combined with a ', evaluates to just the quoted form.
[11:20:24] <jeaye> sandra: So `(do (+ 1 2) ~(+ 1 2) ~'(1 2)) => (do (clojure.core/+ 1 2) 3 (1 2))
[11:20:54] <jeaye> Probably good to see them all side by side like that.
[11:22:41] <sandra> Yeah, ~ is like a , in scheme. It's just that in Scheme you wouldn't often use ,' on a single symbol since that's a pretty much a nop. You might do it on a list, like `(a b ,'(c ,d)) is different from `(a b ,'(c d)) 
[11:23:10] <sandra> But in clojure the ` also resolves symbols

[15:04:44] <EdwardIII> anyone using vim-iced with figwheel-main? the docs say just run ':IcedCljsRepl (figwheel.main.api/repl-env "build-id")' but when i try it nvim says ".nrepl-port is not found."
[15:05:34] <EdwardIII> it says you need figwheel-main >= 0.2.0, i have 0.2.13 so should be good there
[15:05:47] <victor> EdwardIII: I think you need to connect first to the nrepl instance figwheel starts, should output a nrepl port to stdout when starting figwheel. Otherwise I think there is a setting for outputting .nrepl-port automatically
[15:06:18] <victor> EdwardIII: slight side-note, I'd give Conjure a try if I were you. I was using vim-iced before but once I found Conjure I never looked back (with Neovim)
[15:06:38] <EdwardIII> victor: oh?
[15:06:43] <EdwardIII> i see conjure has coc integration too
[15:09:53] <EdwardIII> victor: any particular reason you preferred it? i might give it a try
[15:12:30] <victor> EdwardIII: codebase is more accessible (to me, I know more Lua than Vim script) so easier to see what's going on when needed. Conjure has a nice log window via Neovims floating windows and finally Conjure's codebase is modular and works with many languages/runtimes (vim-iced didn't work with Babashka last time I tried it [~1 year ago maybe])
[15:12:57] <EdwardIII> sounds pretty good
[15:13:22] <victor> EdwardIII: here is an example for getting figwheel-main + Conjure hooked up together: https://gist.github.com/pyrmont/73d10c74d14f26772fd276c38ee3490d
[15:19:32] <EdwardIII> huh so it's written in clojure which transpiles to lua 
[15:19:42] <ridcully> the .nrepl-port file should be created once you fire it up (e.g. lein does that)
[15:20:38] <EdwardIII> ridcully: ah, it doesn't seem to be creating it. but i think mabye it needs some more setup than i have 
[15:20:52] <ridcully> if you think you have a nrepl running, but the file is missing in your project root, you can create that file.  it only contains the port number the repl runs on (but at that point you could most likely easier connect your vim to the repl directly)
[15:21:44] <EdwardIII> i'm not sure i do have it running, i'm just doing "lein fig:build", and i'm not sure that does nrepl: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/66e95ff0f859c0ab53a761fc4cd4c8b0#file-project-clj-L53
[15:22:04] <victor> ridcully: then you'd have to manually delete it afterwards as well :) I think what EdwardIII needs is to add the neccessary config/code to create that file on startup automatically
[15:22:08] <ridcully> i basically never switched over to figwheel-main and i only ran iced for a month - so IIRC i had mixed results in that general direction, but i can not be sure
[15:22:40] <EdwardIII> yeah that conjure example has lots more to it heh
[15:22:51] <EdwardIII> i think that setup is perhaps implicit in the iced guide
[15:22:52] <ridcully> victor: i have projects with fixed ports set and i even kept the file in git (but this is old stuff...)
[15:23:29] <victor> ridcully: I see. I seem to recall that nrepl by default binds to 0 (so random free port on each boot), but maybe I remember incorrectly
[15:23:36] <ridcully> most likely nrepl never got started?
[15:23:49] <EdwardIII> i think so
[15:23:55] <EdwardIII> i don't see anything about nrepl in the figwheel startup: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/b8f15a0a63eae3ce30dc85ac3386b2f0
[15:24:06] <EdwardIII> would nrepel normally be a separate process you run from the console?
[15:24:20] <ridcully> right, and will print that port inside the repl (where you could use it to directly connect from vim (at least with fireplace)) or you can rely on the .nrepl-port being picked up
[15:24:45] <EdwardIII> ah ha yes i don't have any of that
[15:25:04] <ridcully> IIRC you run `iced repl` somewhere else
[15:25:31] <ridcully> it wraps whatever you are actually using and provides the interface for vim
[15:25:42] <EdwardIII> hrm yes so when i'm doing jvm-clojure, i do use iced repl which reas the lein config and starts the lein repl
[15:26:04] <ridcully> (this is all IIRC, last used it around 2020-12-26 or so ;))
[15:26:07] <victor> right, that was another hassle with vim-iced over Conjure, vim-iced assumes you can/want to wrap everything into their own commands like `iced repl`
[15:26:53] <EdwardIII> pretty sure i will try conjure, interested to understand this a bit though also heh
[15:29:33] <EdwardIII> ah ha it's a bit hidden away, you can start iced repl --with-cljs, hrm that all starts OK but then when i try to use features it says `Session error. You should be in cljs session.` heh
[15:30:57] <EdwardIII> yeah i think it also assumes like the conjure gist example above that you've got, in your own project, figwheel.main.api/repl-env with some stuff in it

[18:19:39] <EdwardIII> ok i've stepped back, i'm now trying from this guide: https://figwheel.org/docs/vim.html so i run `lein repl`, this puts me in imjur.core (jvm-land). i run (require 'figwheel.main.api) (figwheel.main.api/start {:mode :serve} "dev") - this doesn't work, because it no longer uses my target dir for js, so when it opens in the browser, my js doesn't load
[18:21:03] <EdwardIII> i can say  (figwheel.main.api/start "dev"), which DOES read my settings correctly, drops the repl prompt into cljs.user, and my app is playable. but then the namespace figwheel.main.api is no longer available (WARNING: No such namespace: figwheel.main.api)

[21:54:39] <oreoking[m]> <technomancy> "oreoking: then the list will..." <- nvm i figured it out
[21:54:53] <oreoking[m]> Is there a package manager for clojure.
[21:55:36] <oreoking[m]> To install clojure applications.
[21:57:03] <oreoking[m]> Like pip from python.
[21:59:17] <Para> such a concept doesn't exist in most programming languages; dependencies are managed by tools such as Leiningen
[22:04:15] <ToxicFrog> I would argue that Leiningen is the realization of that concept for clojure
[22:04:35] <ToxicFrog> But yeah, generally people use leiningen (with dependencies declared in project.clj) or clj (with dependencies declared in deps.edn)
[22:04:52] <ToxicFrog> That's for installing libraries, though; I don't know if either can install compiled apps.

[23:35:48] <jeaye> Is there any way I can get case to use a def for a list of alternates? Or somehow refactor it out to have a name.
[23:36:28] <jeaye> i.e. (def nums '(1 2 3)) (case foo nums "good" "bad") ; trying to make this good
[23:39:15] <ToxicFrog> Does it have to be case, or can you do something like:
[23:39:17] <ToxicFrog> (def nums #{1 2 3}) (if (nums foo) "good" "bad")
[23:39:26] <ToxicFrog> If it has more clauses than that you could do something with cond or condp rather than case.
[23:39:51] <jeaye> Easy enough when it's not a case, but I'm wondering if this can work with case.
[23:40:16] <jeaye> Since this code is in the middle of an existing case.
[23:40:39] *** Quits: mattil (~mattilinn@87-92-142-109.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:53:37] <ToxicFrog> case is a macro, so it needs all the stuff available at macroexpansion time
[23:57:57] <jeaye> Yeah, ended up working around it.
[23:58:44] <jeaye> I'd really like to be able to def something as ^:static and have it available in macros as a compile-time literal.
