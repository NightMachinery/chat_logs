[00:29:57] <jaggz> somiaj, I wonder what might be setting that
[00:30:18] <jaggz> X does run before user login, so it makes sense it might have its own.  I *believe* upon login the .bashrc is loaded though
[00:30:28] <greycat> find out what it *is* first, then it's much easier to determine what's setting it
[00:30:34] <jaggz> I wonder how to see what X sees as its current env
[00:30:57] <greycat> You're going about it entirely backwards.  It's not X's environment.
[00:31:09] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/Xsession -- standard xsessions don't parse profile or bashrc, but have their own things they setup.

[00:31:48] <greycat> You're invoking this dolphin thing in two different ways, right?  One via a shell, and the other via a mouse click of some kind.  What I would do is set up a script that dumps the environment to a file, then arrange for that to be executed by the EXACT SAME mouse click type mechanism that you're using for dolphin.
[00:32:18] <greycat> Then you can run the env dumper by mouse, and get the environment in a file, and compare that to the shell's environment.

[02:39:36] <amacater_> Possibly part of the python2 -> python3 transition.
[02:39:42] <amacater_> python3 should work
[02:39:48] <dashs> jinnjus: me2 yesterday. No /etc/alternatives entry, so I made a softlink to python2.7 for my purpose.
[02:39:55] <jinnjus> it does
[02:40:02] <jinnjus> oops
[02:40:09] <sussudio> why would you need python in a default install
[02:40:16] <amacater_> Don't use Python 2.7 - really, don't. It has no support anywhere
[02:40:27] <jinnjus> python3 is there in the default install but no python command to symlink to it
[02:40:46] <sussudio> if another package needs python, it will pull it in.
[02:41:09] <dashs> 3.9 would not run i3status correctly.
[02:41:23] <somiaj> jinnjus: that is because the binary is 'python3' not 'python'

[02:43:00] <jinnjus> somiaj: yes, I guess my question is why doesn't python3 pull that in automatically if there is no other python installed on the system?
[02:43:11] <amacater_> jinnjus -see somiaj's suggestion

[06:10:13] <mannequin> idk, go search the web, write on forums or waste your time in another way
[06:10:17] <foehammer> I did
[06:10:22] <foehammer> Read around
[06:10:46] <mannequin> what is the program you try to compile?
[06:11:04] <sussudio> ,i surf2
[06:11:05] <judd> No package named 'surf2' was found in bullseye/amd64.
[06:11:08] <sussudio> ,i surf
[06:11:11] <judd> Package surf (web, optional) in bullseye/amd64: Simple web browser by suckless community. Version: 2.0+git20201107-2; Size: 29.0k; Installed: 106k; Homepage: https://surf.suckless.org; Screenshot: https://screenshots.debian.net/package/surf
[06:11:17] <foehammer> surf browser @ https://surf.suckless.org/
[06:11:29] <mannequin> just use another browser
[06:11:34] <foehammer> no
[06:11:38] <mannequin> firefox is cool
[06:11:41] <foehammer> This one Is the one I want
[06:11:55] <mannequin> you want something from debian it wont offer
[06:11:55] <foehammer> I need to find what the issue is here
[06:11:57] <somiaj> foehammer: note, it could totally be possible that upstream source is not buildable using debian stable libs/tools. This can happen with rappidly evolving upstream.
[06:12:05] <foehammer> oh ok
[06:12:09] <sussudio> apt install surf
[06:12:36] <foehammer> I know, but to gain the functionality, you need to be able to build it from source
[06:12:48] <foehammer> otherwise it is literally just bad firefox
[06:12:51] <somiaj> foehammer: gain what functionality? Why won't the debian package work for you?
[06:12:54] <somiaj> ,v surf
[06:12:55] <judd> Package: surf on amd64 -- stretch: 0.7-2; stretch-backports: 2.0+git20181009-4~bpo9+1; buster: 2.0+git20181009-4; bullseye: 2.0+git20201107-2; bookworm: 2.1+git20210719-1; sid: 2.1+git20210719-1
[06:13:02] <somiaj> ,check-backport surf
[06:13:03] <judd> Backporting package surf in sid→bullseye/amd64: unsatisfiable build dependencies: Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13).
[06:13:10] <foehammer> hmm
[06:13:31] <foehammer> bruhb
[06:13:37] <somiaj> hmm, that isn't pointing out anything special needed to backport surf, so you could try to just recompile the bullseye version or backport
[06:13:45] <foehammer> How
[06:13:48] <foehammer> Wait
[06:13:55] <foehammer> I see something I missed
[06:13:56] <foehammer> https://surf.suckless.org/
[06:14:19] <foehammer> read this page, look at the part where it says you should compile your own web2k

[06:15:22] <mannequin> or just use prebuilt debian binaries to install firefox and take a day off
[06:16:19] <foehammer> please, I already said that was not the option I was looking for, please stop telling me that Debian "Is not gonna offer the functionality that I need"
[06:16:49] <mannequin> i don't think this an issue suitable for debian support
[06:16:58] <mannequin> contact suckless support
[06:17:12] <foehammer> judd how do I compule the backport
[06:17:33] <somiaj> !ssb
[06:17:33] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[06:19:33] <foehammer> nah Im going back to arch linux
[06:19:47] <somiaj> note, building complicated software like a browser might require a good understanding of both the software, how build processes work, and how to build in debian. If the source isn't building with installing build-essential and installing the build-dep for the package, it may take a little bit of work to get everything to work out.
[06:19:58] <foehammer> ok

[06:29:33] <foehammer> What expectations
[06:29:50] <mannequin> eh whatever
[06:30:12] <mannequin> i don't care to participate in this convo anymore
[06:30:54] <jmcnaught> foehammer: are you looking to get a newer version of surf than is available in Debian 11 bullseye?
[06:31:10] <foehammer> no
[06:31:25] <jmcnaught> foehammer: you want to recompile it with different options or a patch or something?
[06:31:55] <foehammer> Essentially all suckless programs are configured by editing the source code and recompiling them
[06:32:11] <jmcnaught> dpkg: package recompile
[06:32:11] <dpkg> 1) Add a <deb-src> line for your current release to your sources.list 2) apt update; apt install build-essential devscripts fakeroot; apt build-dep packagename 3) as any user, apt-get source packagename 4) cd packagename-version/; ask me about <debian/rules>; 5) dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us 6) as root, apt install ../packagename-version.deb.

[14:30:28] <shibboleth> kinda surprising that gitlab are the ones bevaing like a-holes in those regards

[14:38:27] <Khepra> pretty sure gitlab devs don't wanna waste their time on three users who are terrified of javascript. their time is better used for hundreds of thousands with 21st century browsers.

[14:39:27] <shibboleth> they sure didn't waste their time *removing* non-js support

[14:41:01] <Khepra> still funny, how in 2022 there are people still afraid of javascript.
[14:42:12] <shibboleth> how people wanna be able to read text without loading a bunch of arbitrary code?
[14:42:20] <shibboleth> yeah..
[14:42:52] <Khepra> you're alreadyd loading a bunch of arbitrary code the moment you press the power button. why is js different? hint: it's not.
[14:43:06] <shibboleth> right
[14:43:13] <Khepra> it's just a bit of code in sevice of interfec presetnation and interactivity.
[14:43:18] <shibboleth> the bios/uefi/etc/etc is static
[14:43:27] <shibboleth> whereas whatever gitlab wants your browser to load is not
[14:43:46] <Khepra> so wha?
[14:44:02] <shibboleth> it's called a "difference"
[14:44:04] <Khepra> why is js different from gazillions of opcodes you have to run to even get to gitlab.
[14:44:37] <shtrb> Khepra, says the person who know that there should be an apparmor script in a vm just against FF :D
[14:44:57] <Khepra> you're running dozens of libraries you have no idea how well they're written, tested, if at all, with how many bugs, if any. I'll bet you ten NFTs your browser already has vulns present that will soon get announced and patched.
[14:45:12] <Khepra> shtrb: nonsequitur. I'm not afraid of js.
[14:45:14] <shibboleth> funny how quickly that pivoted into NFTs
[14:45:37] <Khepra> and my apparmor profile has nothing to do with JS and everything to do with RCE vulns that MOSTLY have nothing to do with JS.
[14:45:59] <shtrb> I bet you a tulip , that the debian packages libs are more trustworthy than some JS package

[14:46:46] <shibboleth> but what about the children?
[14:47:29] <Khepra> it's still funny how people are afraid of JS but aren't afraid of libpng.

[14:50:04] <shtrb> ?
[14:50:10] <Khepra> and it has the ability to load images into console
[14:50:37] <shibboleth> "i don't see this is an issue and so therefore there must be something wrong with you"

[14:51:04] <shibboleth> yeah... "the other..."
[14:51:04] <Khepra> exactly.
[14:51:11] <Khepra> the three of yous with no JS :) lol.
[14:51:48] <shibboleth> and now we know we're not really having a debate, this is you defending your cognitive biases. how about every user of tbb?
[14:51:51] <shibboleth> more than three
[14:51:59] <Khepra> okay four.

I got `Debian 10` and basically I get `/opt/net.downloadhelper.coapp/converter/build/linux/64/ffprobe: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /opt/net.downloadhelper.coapp/converter/build/linux/64/libxvidcore.so.4)` despite having installed `libc6/oldstable,now 2.28-10 amd64 [installed]`
[17:44:45] <jelly> ,v libc6
[17:44:46] <judd> Package: libc6 on amd64 -- stretch-security: 2.24-11+deb9u1; stretch: 2.24-11+deb9u4; buster: 2.28-10; bullseye: 2.31-13+deb11u2; bookworm: 2.33-6; sid: 2.33-7; experimental: 2.34-0experimental3
[17:45:25] <jelly> fakuve, your /opt/net.downloadhelper.coapp/converter/build/linux/64/ffprobe binary was built on a system with newer glibc (libc6) than what's in Debian 10
[17:45:44] <fakuve> mmm I see
[17:45:52] <jelly> `GLIBC_2.29' <- this symbol very likely requires libc6 >= 2.29

[17:46:10] <jelly> rebuild the thing for buster, or run it on debian 11
[17:46:14] <StyXman> yrdsb: it depends a log on what is playing that sound
[17:46:28] <fakuve> jelly: Can I upgrade my whole system to Debian 11 ?

[17:46:41] <fakuve> I'm starting to have so many dependencies problems
[17:46:53] <jelly> it is possible to upgrade a whole OS in-place without reinstalling, yes
[17:46:53] <fakuve> But I don't want to format the PC
[17:47:12] <jelly> but any custom code that your have might break
[17:47:22] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[17:47:22] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[17:47:27] <jelly> fakuve, ^ read that
[17:47:34] <fakuve> jelly: Cheers !!
[17:47:59] <jelly> judd, file bin/ffprobe
[17:48:01] <judd> Search for bin/ffprobe in bullseye/amd64: ffmpeg: usr/bin/ffprobe
[17:48:17] <jelly> fakuve, your tool seems to be shipping a copy of ffmpeg.
[17:48:20] <shtrb> Is there a debian mirror over torrent ?

[17:51:16] <jelly> fakuve, you might be able to replace that embedded ffprobe with a copy from the ffmpeg package.
[17:52:07] <jelly> but ffmpeg can be built with various options so that might make break some functionality

[18:19:25] <jelly> yrdsb, ask in #ubuntu ; You're already in #ubuntu-offtopic and other channels so you know your way there.
[18:19:26] <shtrb> which DE are you using ?

[18:19:36] <dpkg> Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it is not Debian.  Only Debian is supported on #debian.  Use #ubuntu on irc.libera.chat instead.  Even if the channel happens to be less helpful, support for distributions other than Debian is offtopic on #debian.  See also <based on debian> and <ubuntuirc>.

[18:20:36] <yrdsb> you do know that

[18:20:47] <jelly> otherwise, ask the people who know something about your distro, not us

[21:44:54] <somiaj> you can also just edit debian/patches/series if you don't want to use quilt to enable/disable certain patches.
[21:45:26] <samiamsam> i just want to disable patches that have already been applied
[21:45:52] <somiaj> just remove them from debian/pathces/series then

[21:47:30] <samiamsam> it cannot be that other developers are fucking around with quilt just ot get incremental builds working
[21:47:42] <samiamsam> they must be using a completely different build process that doesn't even involve Vcs-Git, right?

[21:48:14] <somiaj> maybe someone who does more than dabble with this will chime in, but I haven't had issues with using quilt in the few packages I build from git.
[21:48:26] <somiaj> Though I'm more just trying to build for my use, not doing incremential builds.
[21:49:20] <samiamsam> it doesn't appear that these repositories are set up in a way that is at all useful to do development
[21:49:36] <samiamsam> yet it seems like that should be the point of them?  very confusing
[21:49:54] <somiaj> the debian maintainers/developers seem to use them just fine.
[21:50:00] <samiamsam> do they?
[21:50:02] <samiamsam> i doubt it

[21:50:28] <somiaj> Though what are you trying to develop? Are you trying to add debian patches to a source, or are you trying to develop stuff for upstream?
[21:50:56] <samiamsam> i am trying to diagnose a bug by disabling some bit of code to see if it resolves an issue
[21:51:15] <somiaj> is this bit of code in upstream or a debian patch?
[21:51:32] <samiamsam> i wouldn't know
[21:51:41] <samiamsam> i haven't even looked at the source
[21:52:00] <somiaj> Anyways, as I said, I seem to have no trouble with the one package I maintain to make changes to the source to test things out. So maybe the issue is not fully understanding the debian build process?
[21:52:01] <samiamsam> the build was taking a long time so i decided to interrupt it and see if it build incrementally so that i'd know whether the build would be useful

[21:52:33] <samiamsam> you say you don't have trouble, but you also say you have exactly the same trouble
[21:52:40] <samiamsam> i.e., you don' thave incremental builds working from Git-VCS sources either
[21:52:56] <somiaj> debian packages like to build from a clean source each time, I haven't tried to not do this, since I prefer to build from a clean tree each time to make sure the full build process works.
[21:53:09] <somiaj> though the packages I use only take a couple of minutes to build, so I don't worry to much.
[21:53:13] <samiamsam> lol
[21:53:22] <somiaj> (I also like to build in a clean chroot each time using pbuilder)
[21:53:23] <samiamsam> a couple of minutes isn't workable anyway
[21:53:48] <samiamsam> there is a reason Make exists

[23:50:13] <Awaru> hi
[23:50:33] <Awaru> what do you recommend me as a debian os for irc server, but also a bit webhosting and some files and such stuff
[23:50:36] <Awaru> but mainly the webhosting
[23:50:42] <Awaru> like debian 10, debian 11,...?
[23:50:46] <Awaru> what kind of debian?
[23:51:26] <ede> !stable
[23:51:26] <dpkg> [stable] The status of a Debian release when no packages will be added or version-bumped, and changes will only fix security issues and critical bugs. Packages can be removed in rare circumstances. The current stable version of Debian is Bullseye (11.x); ask me about <releases>. Security bugs are fixed in stable by backporting the fix to the stable version (ask me about <security backports>). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable
[23:52:25] <Khepra> Awaru: if you're going to rent a server, make sure you read the hosting company TOS, many are disallowing irc servers
[23:52:41] <Awaru> nope this definately not
[23:52:54] <Awaru> however, this has nothing to do with my question i suppose?
[23:53:09] *** Joins: RhinosF1 (uid339563@miraheze/RhinosF1)
[23:53:13] <Awaru> which one is the stable version right now?
[23:53:14] <Khepra> it's a side-warning
[23:53:15] <Awaru> of debian
[23:53:26] <greycat> It says right there.  Debian 11 (bullseye).
[23:53:27] <amacater_> Debian 11 Bullseye
[23:53:31] <Awaru> ok
[23:53:38] <Awaru> and can ih ave that withotu all the additional package?
[23:53:41] <Awaru> just a light system
[23:53:43] <Awaru> without anything
[23:53:50] <Awaru> without much
[23:53:59] <greycat> yes
[23:54:35] <amacater_> Install a minimal system - really minimal - by doing an expert install and unchecking everything you don't need. Standard and an SSH server is only about a couple of hundred packages.
[23:54:52] <amacater_> Text mode install - don't install anything graphical

[23:55:16] <greycat> Or just do a Standard install.  It's not much more than "minimum".
