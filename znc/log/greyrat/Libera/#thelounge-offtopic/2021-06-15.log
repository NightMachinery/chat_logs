[10:39:24] <Snuupy> wtf lol
[10:43:23] <bookworm> WTF
[10:43:34] <bookworm> that's worse than I thought
[10:44:41] <bookworm> but hey if they nuked all the nicks that's gonna be fun
[10:45:17] <fnutt> I've seen the messages...and I've tried reconnecting.. but..
[10:45:21] <bookworm> but there goes my registration date...
[10:45:39] <bookworm> nah, no reason to beat a dead horse
[10:45:39] <fnutt> (1) I cannot connect as fnutt without SASL enabled with my password... since without sasl it times out.
[10:45:58] <fnutt> "*** Closing link: (~fnutt@60.151.202.35.bc.googleusercontent.com) [Registration timeout] (irc)"
[10:46:32] <fnutt> (2) I can still see #kiwiirc and #thelounge with correct topics and such. Ergo they must still be there?
[10:46:40] <fnutt> So... what's up? lol
[10:46:48] <bookworm> the dude really needs a PR capable person though
[10:46:52] <fnutt> I don't get it. I've read the wall messages.
[10:46:57] <bookworm> they could've just sat it out
[10:47:03] <bookworm> but no, speedrun it is
[10:47:55] <bookworm> you're maybe still on the old world? IDK
[10:48:26] <bookworm> in any case, where's that facepalm emoji? ðŸ¤¦
[10:48:34] <bookworm> found it ;P
[10:49:31] <Snuupy> 02:02:57 AM <Sketch> i guess they don't have enough users left to care about migrating accounts
[10:49:32] <Snuupy> hahahahaha
[10:49:55] <bookworm> nice one too XD
[10:50:44] <fnutt> Alright.. TL bug inc!
[10:51:00] <fnutt> Channels topic are not reseted in TL when joining Freenode channels.
[10:51:09] <fnutt> I still saw the old topic in channels.
[10:51:18] <fnutt> When I typed /topic, it went away.
[10:51:23] <bookworm> you sure that's not a broken network thing?
[10:51:37] <bookworm> they need to send the topic  did they?
[10:52:03] <bookworm> unless you have the raw traffic a bug will be pretty non actionable
[10:52:29] <fnutt> http://35.202.151.60:9000/uploads/64f4db4bfd771205/image.png 
[10:52:40] <fnutt> It seems like it did not send the topic on channel join.
[10:52:52] <fnutt> The 08:20 regarding topic is when I typed /topic.
[10:53:04] <bookworm> there you go
[10:55:18] <fnutt> ~blittenb@freenode-2pp.muj.p3iv75.IP has taken #thelounge channel btw.
[10:56:43] <bookworm> godspeed
[10:56:52] <bookworm> hm it may actually be a bug
[10:56:57] <bookworm> >After this, they are sent the channelâ€™s topic (with RPL_TOPIC), and no message if the channel does not have a topic.
[10:57:18] <bookworm> from the ircv3 nottherealspecbutbetterthantheoldandbrokenones
[10:57:29] <bookworm> https://modern.ircdocs.horse/
[10:58:03] <bookworm> I wonder how widespread that behavior is... would need to keep state and clear the topic then if we don't receive it
[10:58:28] <fnutt> :)
[10:58:33] <bookworm> chances are that normal networks anyhow send a topic even if none exists, can check in a bit
[10:58:46] <fnutt> I can imagine there's a bunch of Freenode users going to experience this now.
[10:59:13] <bookworm> mkey, open up the bug then, maybe cite the thingy I just posted
[11:00:29] <fnutt> oh my god...
[11:00:31] <bookworm> then I can instaclose the bug with LEENODE GAAHAHAGA or something
[11:00:41] <fnutt> You cannot type in channels on the "OLD" Freenode.
[11:02:21] <bookworm> that even makes sense when you migrate
[11:02:34] <bookworm> I mean we did just the same with our old chan ;P
