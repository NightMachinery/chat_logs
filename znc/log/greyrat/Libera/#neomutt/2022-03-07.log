[13:21:14] <flatcap> morning all
[13:47:38] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[13:48:02] <gahr> interestingly, an SMTP account doesn't get a MUTT_ACCT_USER flag unless the user is part of the url
[13:48:16] <gahr> if you set smtp_url without a user but set smtp_user, it won't authenticate
[13:51:38] *** Quits: maerwald (~maerwald@user/maerwald) (Quit: gone)
[13:51:42] *** breavyn_ is now known as breavyn
[13:52:01] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[13:52:32] <flatcap> oh dear
[13:55:01] <gahr> I think that's because MUTT_ACCT_USER is set lazily the first time you ask for the user
[13:55:25] <gahr> imap always tries to authenticate, so the account will have the MUTT_ACCT_USER when it first tries to auth
[13:55:36] <gahr> smtp on the other hand, only tries to auth if the account already has the MUTT_ACCT_USER flag
[13:57:35] <flatcap> I see
[13:59:14] <gahr> let me try to fix it up real quick
[14:00:14] <flatcap> thanks
[14:04:34] <gahr> #3290
[14:04:35] <neo-bot> PR by @gahr "Force SMTP authentication if smtp_user is set": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3290
[14:04:43] * flatcap looks ...
[14:08:10] <flatcap> looks reasonable
[14:08:39] <flatcap> I presume it works :-)
[14:10:24] <gahr> it does :)
[14:12:26] <flatcap> ok. lgtm
[14:16:57] <gahr> I wonder if many users have smtp_user and no username in the url and want unauthenticated smtp :/
[14:19:08] <gahr> back to important stuff: I can't repro the leaks :/
[14:19:15] <flatcap> if they set smtp_user, we don't want to connect unauthenticated
[14:19:15] <gahr> on 3282
[14:19:27] <gahr> good, then the fix is probably good
[14:20:31] <flatcap> hmm... that's odd.  let me see if I can simplify my config
[14:23:35] <flatcap> that's with `set imap_check_subscribed = yes`
[14:24:24] <gahr> you don't see the "freeing ... " logs?
[14:24:59] <gahr> ah
[14:25:01] <flatcap> changing to `mailboxes` I don't get any leaks

[14:39:28] <gahr> can you please try this commit? b733c12203e4b9cb10d3858caa61032e45bb7f08
[14:39:31] <flatcap> that only frees the Mailboxes we haven't already leaked
[14:39:36] <flatcap> ;-)
[14:39:49] <flatcap> sure
[14:39:52] <gahr> if you already have it
[14:40:03] <gahr> oh
[14:40:22] <gahr> so we leak before... mh
[14:40:54] * flatcap builds ...
[14:43:15] <flatcap> exactly the same: leaks for imap_check_subscribed=yes, but not otherwise
[14:43:33] * flatcap is relieved that his rebase hasn't wasted gahr's time :-)
[14:43:49] <gahr> :)
[14:43:55] <gahr> thanks for double checking

[14:49:44] <gahr> ok I get it, parse_mailboxes doesn't create a hidden mailbox
[14:50:08] <gahr> and with imap_check_subscribed, we keep matching existing mailboxes, so they aren't added to the account and are leaked
[14:51:27] <flatcap> aha
[14:59:07] <gahr> so my approach would be to always create mailboxes hidden
[14:59:14] <gahr> and only make them visible upon a "mailboxes" command

[14:59:52] <flatcap> sounds good
[14:59:55] <gahr> also, I fear valgrind is not in a very good state on FreeBSD.. it's not detecting the leak :/
[15:00:02] <gahr> can I use yours? :)
[15:00:43] <flatcap> I'm using ASAN
[15:02:11] <gahr> I thought I was always running with asan
[15:02:16] <gahr> let me double check my setup :/
[15:02:22] <flatcap> no leaks
[15:02:40] <flatcap> oh, I'm using `mailboxes` :-(
[15:02:46] * flatcap tries again

[15:10:40] <gahr> yep yep it works fine for memory checks

[16:43:59] <flatcap> I like your competition idea
[16:45:48] <flatcap> how smart do you need your wrapping?  what's the text that's causing problems?
[16:46:14] <dcpurton> a list of links produced from an html dump

[16:46:31] <dcpurton> 1. www.reallylonglinkthatwraps.com
[16:46:40] <dcpurton> you get a line break after 1.
[16:47:11] <flatcap> ah, yes.  that's a common problem
[16:47:13] <dcpurton> another option would be to set smart_wrap = no for html dump
[16:47:41] <flatcap> there are special ansi escape sequences to handle them, but ncurses gets in our way

[16:50:28] <dcpurton> oh
[16:50:32] <dcpurton> interesting
[16:50:42] <flatcap> the usual solution is urlview (Ctrl-B) in /etc/neomuttrc
[16:51:04] <dcpurton> although that connects the first and third lines and second and fourth lines 
[16:51:26] <flatcap> that's deliberate for the demo...
[16:51:36] <dcpurton> ah
[16:51:59] <flatcap> there's a unique ref number in each link,so that if you split the line over two lines, the terminal can still recognise it as one link

[17:03:57] <dcpurton> I had a go at putting together a sample mbox file
[17:04:19] <flatcap> how'd you get on
[17:04:20] <flatcap> ?
[17:04:46] <dcpurton> I'll upload to the discussion thread when I get a little more organised.
[17:04:52] <flatcap> great
[17:05:02] <dcpurton> I don't think it needs to be super big or complicated.
[17:06:03] <flatcap> there's various random test emails in the sample-mail repo
[17:06:33] <flatcap> but we could do with a realistic data set
[17:07:13] * flatcap always feels weird seeing his own emails in example screenshots :-)
[17:10:34] *** Joins: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico)
[17:11:06] <flatcap> perhaps we could pick a juicy section of lkml
[17:11:48] <flatcap> say 100 threaded emails
[17:12:39] <flatcap> and maybe a macro to set up the screen: open/close threads, tag/flag/new some emails

[19:06:23] <gahr> one thing I personally don't want is my neomutt colors be controlled by senders of emails
[19:06:58] <flatcap> don't worry that's not going to happen

[19:38:43] <flatcap> it's so graphical package managers can display them
[19:39:03] <flatcap> but we could really do with a bunch for the website
[19:40:15] <gahr> that is fair enough, I am being unfair

[19:43:34] <flatcap> the crucial part though, is that we want full config so that others can reproduce the results
[19:44:21] <flatcap> there's nothing worse than looking at a screenshot and finding out that you need to compile and extra module and...
[19:45:07] <gahr> what does vim do? (tm)
[19:45:28] <gahr> should we start shipping "themes" 
[19:46:10] <gahr> sidebar-yymmdd-dark-with-pager-index-noweed.cfg
[19:46:11] <gahr> :/
[19:46:13] <flatcap> yes, themes would be great
[19:46:43] <flatcap> possibly split up by area of influence
[19:47:00] <flatcap> I think vim puts them in a certain dir, so  :theme X  just works
[19:47:29] <gahr> you got me to double check that :theme wasn't a thing
[19:47:48] <flatcap> hmm... what am I thinking of?
[19:47:54] <gahr> :colorscheme?
[19:48:53] <flatcap> ah!  that's better
[19:49:04] <gahr> that's just color though (I think)
[19:49:22] <flatcap> yeah, but that'd be a good start
[19:49:24] <gahr> better, highlighting
[19:49:39] <gahr> we have contrib/colorschemes
[19:50:40] <flatcap> oh yeah.  I haven't looked at them in a long time

[21:28:40] <alec> is there a way to remove mail from my inbox (using imap) without deleting it? like an "archive" function or something?
[21:29:53] <bookworm> alec: move it to the archive?
[21:29:55] <bookworm> too easy?
[21:31:13] <alec> bookworm: could you point me in the right direction please? i've nearly drowned in the documentation without finding the word "archive"
[21:33:07] <bookworm> alec: <save-message>, bound to s by default I believe
[21:33:13] <bookworm> then simply pick the folder of your choice

[21:34:03] <bookworm> not sure if that moves or copies, if it copies just delete it afterwards (say with a macro or some such)
[21:34:07] <bookworm> I'm a notmuch user myself

[21:36:17] <alec> can I create a folder from within mutt? or do I have to do that on through the email service provider?
[21:37:25] <bookworm> common intuition says that if you specify a folder that doesn't exist, it will get created
[21:37:32] <bookworm> try it and see if that works
[21:37:41] <alec> tagging sounds better than folders... I wonder if tags can be applied automatically (like via script or config) when an email's received before it's opened
[21:37:56] <alec> great idea! trying...
[21:38:07] <bookworm> yes, you can do that in notmuch and / or imap land (via sieve)
[21:38:46] <bookworm> most email providers give you some sort of pre-filtering of messages. Google has labels, fastmail too and some actually give you sieve (protonmail for instance)
[21:43:20] <alec> it does seem to create folders that don't exist... but now I have figure out how to view contents of a folder :(
[21:43:53] <bookworm> <change-folder> bound to c by default
[21:44:13] <bookworm> https://neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#4-2-%C2%A0index-menu helps
[21:45:40] <bookworm> ? (the literal question mark) as well, that shows you all the functions and some short description plus the keys they are bound to)
[21:46:15] <alec> thank you so much
[21:46:42] <bookworm> no worries, neomutt (while awesomely configurable) isn't exactly easy to use
[21:47:23] <alec> I've spent at least a dozen hours so far in this
[21:47:36] <bookworm> hah, rookie. Took me longer than a weekend :P
[21:48:16] <bookworm> as a tip, rather than just going from the docs, actually look at other peoples configuration
[21:48:21] <alec> now that I have `j` and `k` mapped to to next/prev line, the ? help screen is possible to navigate
[21:48:59] <alec> Yeah, I've been looking at blogs as well as the docs
[21:48:59] <bookworm> C-d and C-u are usually down and up
[21:49:06] <bookworm> C- being control
[21:49:44] <bookworm> <half-down> and <half-up> respectively 
[21:58:34] <alec> bookworm: thanks again, I tried adopting mutt a couple years ago and failed, this time I'm using it. I'll likely adopt notmuch eventually, but for now I'm grateful to be able to move emails out of site to a separate folder!
[21:59:30] <bookworm> I mean, that's the very barebones functionality you need isn't it? Moving stuff around and reading emails and toggling read and flagged states
[22:00:00] <alec> yes, exactly, barebones necessity achieved :)
[22:00:21] <bookworm> now comes the fun part, make it yours :)
