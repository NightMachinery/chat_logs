[00:07:53] <robertparkerx> what if error_log( print_r( $args, true ) ); doesn't do anything in litespeed
[00:09:23] <robertparkerx> what could I use instead
[00:10:52] <AllenJB> Use var_export instead of print_r. Make sure you've configured error_log and log_errors settings in php.ini (and that PHP can write to the folder you've told it to use for error logs)
[00:15:42] <robertparkerx> can I write to a txt file?
[00:16:49] <__adrian> robertparkerx> what if error_log( print_r( $args, true ) ); doesn't do anything in litespeed  // probably means litespeed is not configured to log anything.
[00:18:13] <robertparkerx> how do I write to a txt file
[00:18:47] <__adrian> https://php.net/file_put_contents
[00:19:39] <stenno> can you do a http request with file_put_contents?
[00:20:21] <stenno> oh no, but with file_get_contents
[00:20:47] <__adrian> stenno: yes (but don't)
[00:20:55] <robertparkerx> dang it nothing is doing it
[00:21:09] <stenno> 'yes, but dont' is also the inofficial motto of javascript
[00:21:29] <__adrian> applies to many things

[00:23:20] <__adrian> that's pretty vague
[00:23:50] <__adrian> stenno: does "http request" have anything to do with robertparkerx's question, or is unrelated?
[00:23:58] <stenno> unrelated
[00:24:05] * __adrian wipes brow
[00:24:10] <__adrian> k. that was close
[00:24:30] <BadAdviceCat> robertparkerx, if you hadn't already, ensure that error_reporting is setup so that you can be informed about what is causing your problem.
[00:24:45] <BadAdviceCat> !+error reporting
[00:24:45] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.

[02:18:54] <ordos> AllenJB, yeah but ill-written extensions aside, FPM's thread safety in general is a work of art. You mentioned running multiple PHP versions / different configurations - you done this in production? Curious about the use-case. I see some old servers desperately in need of decommissioning and I think to myself there's a good use-case for what you describe.
[02:29:02] <TML> ordos: I have servers which run php-fpm in docker containers, with Apache on the host OS fronting all the different containers, and some of those are running very old PHPs indeed

[13:08:36] <tercaL> (Suffering from PHP memory leak of a theme, just found those lines within it) - my default php.ini has memory_limit=512M
[13:11:38] <Naktibalda> why would it restart the process?
[13:11:57] <TinoDidriksen> A theme should definitely not be setting those.
[13:13:06] <Naktibalda> you should be able to make these settings immutable
[13:13:31] <Naktibalda> php_admin_value with mod_php, I don't know about other SAPIs

[14:15:38] <tercaL> well, that's a sad story, I know..
[14:15:54] <tercaL> It seems my theme dev team couldn't solve the memory leak problem, and those lines were their **solution**
[14:16:24] <tercaL> You mean each visit to my website takes 2 GB of physical memory due to PHP?
[14:16:38] <tercaL> *closes his eyes praying; hopefully not.
[14:17:50] <biberu> your theme says it needs 2GB per request / page load, yes
[14:18:08] <biberu> hopefully it uses less, but who knows
[14:18:19] <tercaL> Oh My.....GOSH

[18:04:16] <biberu> it's worrying that it's there at all, but they probably set it because they hit limits previously
[18:04:38] <tercaL> not even God knows what else they added there.
[18:04:53] <biberu> tercaL: how many seconds are you prepared to wait before navigating back?
[18:05:05] <tercaL> maximum 40
[18:05:18] <biberu> i'd guess that you're more patient than most users
[18:05:23] <tercaL> :))
[18:05:29] <biberu> no way i wait 40 seconds for a site to respond
[18:06:09] <biberu> and if it requires 40 seconds to generate a page that's 40 seconds of holding server resources
[18:06:17] <tercaL> indeed..

[20:16:29] <biberu> nkm42: how to get the address the client is connecting from depends on how you set up your network
[20:16:38] <Naktibalda> what's the worst that can happen if he trusts that header?
[20:17:04] <biberu> depends on what he's doing with the data
[20:17:21] <biberu> he shouldn't trust the source for such a function though
[20:18:27] <nkm42> is there any pre-built php function for that?
[20:18:40] <nkm42> or any simple solution?
[20:19:08] <biberu> once you do get an address, it's not necessarily possible to connect to a geographical location, the database you're querying might be incorrect, the user might be using e.g. vpn or be visiting abroad
[20:19:40] <biberu> what are you going to use the country for?
[20:20:41] <judah> nkm42, the most reliable way is to use a pre-compiled database of IP locations. The exact location is not precise, but each country is allocated its own IP space so that will be accurate. You wont be able to account for VPNs and the like, but it would work. Check out that package I linked above
[20:21:33] <biberu> even assuming that the db gives the right answer, what's it for? is it for e.g. language selection?
[20:22:03] <nkm42> yes. i want to select language based on country.

[20:36:46] <__adrian> nkm: what people are trying to point out is that you're taking the wrong approach. you DON'T "need to find the country" in order to choose a language.
[20:37:08] <__adrian> browsers send an "Accept-language" header, and you should prefer this when choosing a language.

[20:37:48] <biberu> gah, typing on a phone really isn't optimal
[20:38:08] <da_wunder> or user might be using some vpn when when that ip most likely isn't the same as the user country

[20:39:01] <nkm96> okay.
[20:39:31] <__adrian> you can parse it using https://php.net/locale.acceptFromHttp
[20:39:53] <nkm96> but if i want to get a statistics that from which country i have how much users?
[20:40:07] <nkm96> saving country is not only for language selection

[20:40:38] <da_wunder> eg. I have used that header like: 1) user loads application first time 2) default language is set (which is usually english) 3) user can choose which language he/she wants to use 4) that selected language is stored to browser localstorage
[20:40:40] <__adrian> best way is to ask
[20:40:56] <__adrian> either explicitly, or via js
[20:41:19] <__adrian> you can still fall back on the ip, but again, realize that the result may not be accurate.
[20:42:01] <nkm96> __adrian. I know it will not be acurate. but an estimate can be got

[20:42:21] <da_wunder> and that is why I would even bother to do that - just use some "default" language on first request and let user to choose which language he/she wants to use and store that localstorage and use that there
[20:42:35] <__adrian> right, but my point is, there are (at least) two, far more reliable options.
[20:43:19] <biberu> either way they are all fallback strategies, the user should be allowed to choose
[20:43:52] <nkm96> okay. get the point
[20:44:37] <nkm96> but i have another question. for getting country based users data. which might be not acurate.
[20:44:37] <nkm96> so what will be suggestion for that?
[20:45:04] <__adrian> "getting country based users data"  what do you mean by this, exactly? what "data"?
[20:45:12] <da_wunder> ^
[20:45:19] <biberu> if your fallback strategy flips a coin, looks at accept-language, or uses a geoip lookup shouldn't affect the structure of your solution
[20:45:37] <nkm96> i mean I have how much users from which country for some statistics purpose
[20:45:59] <da_wunder> nkm96: for that use eg. google analytics or matomo
[20:46:37] <da_wunder> https://matomo.org/
[20:48:23] <nkm96> okay. thanks for your time guys. i will think about it.

[21:09:16] <__adrian> find tools that exist, are well-supported and tested, and learn how to use them.
[21:09:24] <__adrian> you cannot do everything better yourself.
[21:09:26] <da_wunder> it's open source and really widely used, so most likely all the big problems are already fixed
[21:09:28] <__adrian> !+NIH
[21:09:28] <biberu> that's how those getip functions keep spreading ;)
[21:09:28] <php-bot> [NIH] (or "NIH Syndrome"): See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here
[21:11:08] <__adrian> biberu: this is how we keep getting new "simple" DB tools that have sql injection problems
[21:12:15] <biberu> *shudder*

[22:13:04] <da_wunder> yeah, EAP versions most likely contain some bugs - that is why eg. I'm not using those, unless there is some killer feature that I want to use couple of months earlier
[22:21:07] <relipse> ok thanks

[23:31:48] <relipse> Can someone test this registry hack for PHPStorm and let me know if It works? https://github.com/relipse/OpenWithPHPStorm/blob/main/openwithphpstorm.bat
[23:32:12] <relipse> do I have to restart my computer after running as admin?
[23:37:58] <TML> it's been a hot minute since I used Windows, but a `*` in a registry path doesn't look right to me
[23:38:10] <TML> and yes, you would need to restart the machine for some of these changes
