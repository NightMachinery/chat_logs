[00:03:54] <FromDiscord> <auxym> I think we may be misunderstanding your question. It's a program. A text file. You can wipe it all out, rewrite it and recompile any time you want.
[00:06:49] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmm ok you can't change them dynamically
[00:06:54] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> unless I'm missing something lol
[00:07:15] <FromDiscord> <Rika> No you can‚Äôt but you can change it before compilation
[00:07:27] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> ye that was apparent to me even before lol
[00:07:36] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre asking
[00:07:39] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Most of us don‚Äôt
[00:08:29] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> so if I choose an enum scheme I can add new enums but can't remove them without breaking the app for existing users
[00:08:54] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmm that's fine
[00:08:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well yeah just like removing field
[00:09:18] <FromDiscord> <Rika> The way to remove fields or enums is to mark them deprecated
[00:09:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Or
[00:09:56] <FromDiscord> <Rika> When deserialising an old object, map it to the new object
[00:10:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> And save only new objects
[00:10:15] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> that's kinda genius tbh
[00:12:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So your project still has the old objects named ‚ÄúObjectV1‚Äù v2 etc and the new one is just called ‚ÄúObject‚Äù
[00:13:08] <FromDiscord> <Rika> OR
[00:13:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Your object has a version field
[00:13:32] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @hmmm "hmm ok you can't": you can't change the enum typedef dynamically, but you can add / remove entries (flags) from your set any time
[00:13:44] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So you just need to load that field and check what it is, then your proc can use whatever logic (chosen by case statement) to load into the new object
[00:13:54] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> actually I'm having this problem right now since I'm adding options and will break all my pre existing data but I think I don't want to write stuff just map it back, I guess I will do it the caveman way lol
[00:14:36] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Rika "So you just need": This is kinda a database design thing by the way, migration based versioning
[00:15:16] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> yea it's for things that matter I guess üòõ
[00:15:27] <FromDiscord> <auxym> deech has some cool ideas about using macros to upgrade between different generations of your types in this talk: https://thestrangeloop.com/2021/nim-nuggets-systems-programming-and-metaprogramming-magic.html
[00:38:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's a cool idea but i dislike that we have types with versioned names
[00:40:40] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> So for a linux executeable, how do I make on in nim? I know regular linux executeables have .elf, but Iirc it can be any format and linux can execute it.
[00:40:54] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> (edit) "on in" => "one from"
[00:40:57] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ? Just compile?
[00:41:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Linux doesnt have an executable extension
[00:41:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Linux doesn‚Äôt use extensions technically
[00:41:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Linux doesnt use file extension for dispatch it uses it only as a hint for programs
[00:41:56] <FromDiscord> <Rika> If it‚Äôs marked executable, Linux will try to execute it
[00:42:08] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Since im on windows it makes an exe, so is there something I can do to make a executeable for linux from windows?
[00:42:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> There are many Python or other script languages marked as executable and are because of shebang comments or whatever they‚Äôre called
[00:42:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Bubblie "Since im on windows": Okay so cross compile?
[00:42:56] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Is there any docs on cross compilation?
[00:43:15] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> For nim
[00:43:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No we thought you wanted rust cross compilation docs üòú

[01:16:40] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Wait, we have no ability to kill threads in stdlib? How else can I stop a thread hung up on a blocking IO?
[01:17:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Not cross platform probably
[01:18:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Otherwise you might be able to use kill in p thread
[01:19:00] <FromDiscord> <tandy> how does one wrap an async js function ?
[01:19:47] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> That sucks, because I relied on OS to clean up threads after quit(0) but Bash, of all places, gets unresponsive due to one of the threads having blocking `getch()`
[01:20:14] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> I don't really get why the terminal is affected after the program quits
[01:21:46] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> I'm trying to fix this whole mess of threads and not require the user to hit "any key" to release the thread
[01:23:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Seems like the best thing would be to have a custom exit hook which wraps the windows/unix thread close APIs
[01:23:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Or a PR to add that functionality to threads, it's odd it doesnt have it
[01:23:14] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> We have `destroyThread` in std/threads... under `when false:` üò†
[01:34:44] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Anyone has any idea why terminal with bash gets borked in my case? Again, currently I'm not joinning threads, not calling sync or anything, just `quit(0)`. On of the threads is caught blocked waiting for user input. Everything works fine for me with Fish, but with Bash the terminal gets unresponsive, even though the program finishes fine, no zombie threads in sight.
[01:37:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is related to your not tetris eh?
[01:37:06] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Yep
[01:37:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No clue how helpful i'll be but after i'm done documenting micros  procedures i'll take a look
[01:39:02] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Someone reported a bug and I think this is the cause, I'm not really knowledgeable enough in all things terminal so this is a bit baffling.
[01:44:14] <FromDiscord> <auxym> doesn't look like nim has daemon threads like in java/python either. in those langs daemon threads always get killed when their parent (ie your main thread) exits
[01:48:45] <PMunch> That honestly sounds like a bash bug tbh

[15:38:41] <PMunch> @Zoom, nimble files are nimscript
[15:38:49] <PMunch> You shouldn't try to parse them
[15:39:27] <PMunch> You should use `nimble dump --json` if you want to read out the data in your code
[15:39:46] <PMunch> Or import the compiler and execute the Nimble file in the same way Nimble does it
[15:41:35] <PMunch> Damn it.. Spent a large chunk of yesterday trying to figure out why I couldn't access my Raspberry Pi home-automation server.. Turns out it was because I had forgotten to turn off my work VPN :P

[15:48:41] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> wait, I can?
[15:50:54] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> I tried to import after the ini section earlier...
[15:54:25] <PMunch> If you use the new Nimscript format you can import inside of it
[15:54:44] <PMunch> But there is an old format which is just an INI file which doesn't support anything
[15:55:14] <PMunch> Wait, you want to read version from config.nims?
[15:57:10] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> I've already done it copying the parsing proc from cblake, but now I'm moving the task back to .nimble file ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[15:57:46] <PMunch> Wait, what exactly is it that you want to achieve here?
[15:58:10] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Just define a task for nimble to build and name the binaries
[15:58:36] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> It's working fine, what's left is to query the architecture somehow...
[16:01:27] <PMunch> Can't you use read out the architecture in the task?
[16:02:48] <PMunch> Read out buildCPU or hostCPU
[16:04:53] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Read out of what? I'm tempted to just `sizeOf(int)`
[16:05:33] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> Oh, thanks, missed those

[19:00:27] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @Bubblie "I wanted to ask,": what libraries? Nim libraries? Or c++ stuff you imported via `importcpp` ?
[19:00:33] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> nim libraries
[19:00:57] <FromDiscord> <auxym> everything nim gets statically linked together in the final executable
[19:01:36] <FromDiscord> <auxym> so yeah everything is compiled to c++, then compiled by gcc/g++ and linked
[19:01:47] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Holy shit thats awesome
[19:02:02] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> So basically, it still can go at the same processing speed as c++
[19:03:04] <FromDiscord> <auxym> well yeah sort of, nim also has (optional) runtime checks and automatic memory management may have some overhead
[19:04:22] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Yeah Id assume so
[19:04:31] <FromDiscord> <auxym> are you doing FFI with c++? Otherwise the default C backend is likely just as fast at runtime, and has faster builds
[19:04:51] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Sorta, im using futhark with glfw and also using vulkan bindings ive found
[19:05:44] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Im still of course trying to get things to work because windows is a piece of shit
[19:06:15] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> But, I was worried on how it may affect graphics and such and the speed the game goes at
[19:06:39] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> I wanted to use nim for vulkan because it would pretty much eliminate a lot of the verbosity that comes with vulkan C++
[19:06:47] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> And nim can compile down to c++
