[19:19:31] <skye0> for me
[19:23:56] <rawktucc> are you getting all dolled up and pretty :)
[19:24:43] <skye0> i wish i could do that, but i'm working a uniformed job
[19:25:33] <skye0> where i can't be open to basically some of the employees. one is some git who is a covid denier, some know my parents (whom i'm not open to gender) and many just wouldn't get it
[19:26:17] <skye0> at least the other starter for work is non-binary, so i'm not completely alone with regards to gender struggles

[19:26:43] <skye0> would love to back up my windows system(s) but i will have to create an ISO for it, which some linux distros don't have by default
[19:26:50] <skye0> ISO creators
[19:28:08] <rawktucc> oh
[19:28:16] <rawktucc> tbh I was just making a joke about a mirror but :(
[19:28:48] <rawktucc> how are your windows systems formatted? you could use clonezilla to mirror if they're partitions or drives, or just use dd if you don't mind bloat
[19:30:41] <skye0> as normal, but if i ran a 7z command to manually copy everything from the windows drive some nvidia folder stops me from copying everything, even though i'm running as a superuser
[19:31:01] <skye0> hence why i've considered trying to make an iso image of my win 10 system(s) or just copying the partition with gparted
[19:31:03] *** Quits: NotSatoshi (~NotSatosh@user/NotSatoshi) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:31:03] <rawktucc> 7z???
[19:31:13] <rawktucc> use gparted, or dd, or use tar instead tbh
[19:31:15] <skye0> just to archive, no compression
[19:31:33] <rawktucc> you could exclude the nvidia folder, i think 7z has a flag for that
[19:31:40] <rawktucc> the cli method is really annoying I find
[19:31:42] <skye0> i'd use gparted, just need more hard drives. i can try tar too instead
[19:31:43] <rawktucc> commands are not well documented
[19:31:52] <skye0> regarding the nvidia folder, it stops at some obscure directory which i can't really figure out immediately
[19:32:04] <rawktucc> it could be a path length issue if you're on windows itself
[19:32:09] <skye0> i can try using tar or creating an iso or something, idk
[19:32:34] <skye0> rawktucc i'm backing up windows 10 systems via a debian based flash drive distro
[19:33:07] <rawktucc> ohh
[19:33:17] <rawktucc> yeah gparted to make an image of the drive then I guess
[19:33:29] <rawktucc> or clonezilla since it doesn't grab the entirety of the drive size ,saving you space
[19:33:52] <skye0> that would be my go to, but i'm running short on drive space atm. i also need to take time to organize drive space too because i have so many damn duplicates in other directories
[19:34:01] <rawktucc> jdupes!
[19:34:13] <rawktucc> if you have time but not space, use jdupes to find duplicates
[19:34:15] <rawktucc> linux tool
[19:34:59] <skye0> thanks for the recommendation!
[19:35:42] <skye0> i need to book annual leave, i need more time to mess around with my systems. got to scrape some messages from a kaios phone too but they're a pain to work with.
[19:35:55] <skye0> might also use annual leave if i get to move out
[19:36:19] <rawktucc> save it for the move out if you're short on it
[19:36:23] <rawktucc> i used a lot when i did
[19:36:49] <skye0> i think i might have only like 2 weeks' max until april, and this is taking into account just for times where i don't have to work saturdays
[19:37:07] <rawktucc> ah
[19:37:13] <rawktucc> i have a month left and im quitting soon anyway
[19:37:21] <skye0> i could just alternatively go through each message in my kaios phone(s) one by one but that's not ideal
[19:37:32] <rawktucc> im sure there's tools for that
[19:37:41] <rawktucc> and if not maybe an effort worth writing for
[19:37:44] <rawktucc> idk kaios myself
[19:38:18] <skye0> there are tools but they're annoying to work with - they each require legacy systems, namely older versions of firefox with deprecated features and ubuntu 18.04
[19:38:46] <skye0> i wanted kaios in order to degoogle but they're just painful to work with, considering too they are based on a project that firefox abandoned
[19:38:53] <rawktucc> sounds like a project worth of a VM
[19:38:58] <skye0> ,s/firefox abandoned/mozilla abandoned
[19:38:58] <unfinity> 04<skye0> i wanted kaios in order to degoogle but they're just painful to work with, considering too they are based on a project that mozilla abandoned
[19:39:13] <skye0> just started work too, can't quit. only reason i don't want to quit is because one of my coworkers will understand my gender issues, since i believe they're non-binary from what they told me
[19:39:39] <skye0> thankfully i might get some therapy that could help me cope with personal issues that crop up at work, mainly gender issues. i'll have to let them know about how i can cope with other employees too
[19:39:54] <skye0> covid denialist also happens to have worked for far longer than many of us have
[19:39:58] <skye0> working as a pharmacy assistant

[20:04:11] <skye0> TIL most of what's taking up storage space on my laptop were Sims 4 recordings of uncompressed quality (yet they still look like shit)
[20:05:52] <rawktucc> what video format are they in?
[20:06:00] <rawktucc> not the container, so not mp4 mkv whatever. the video format
[20:09:04] <skye0> .avi
[20:09:45] <skye0> recorded enough to the point they're as big as a modern game
[20:10:06] <skye0> next time i might consider recording in just high quality
[20:11:29] <skye0> 77 gb of just a handful of clips
[20:11:41] <skye0> none lasting for more than a few minutes too
[20:12:17] <rawktucc> .avi is the container :(
[20:12:22] <rawktucc> i mean the video CODEC
[20:12:35] <rawktucc> doesnt really matter I guess
[20:13:01] <rawktucc> they're big files but just weird the quality is no good
[20:13:52] <skye0> gonna need to check. i think the quality's shit  because of game limitations. still transferring and now windows explorer decided to lag out
[20:19:46] <skye0> they're about 4gb each, nothing on the codec i can find yet i'm afraid
[20:20:51] <rawktucc> shrugs all around!
[20:20:59] <rawktucc> i was mainly curious as to what codec was used if the quality was no good
