[00:12:11] <vandusen> [eggs] xj version 1.24 (for CHICKEN 5) has been released
[00:36:26] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:38:16] <Zipheir> wasamasa: The SRFI 4 read syntax stuff is easy to adapt, but I'm not sure how we can support #u8"..." without breaking SRFI 4 #u8(...) syntax.
[00:39:38] <Zipheir> You've got to read the 'u8 tag, but, at that point, the port is passed where the SRFI 4 read-hook expects to be to read a u8vector.
[00:43:21] <Bunny351> why can't you just override ##sys#user-read-hook?
[00:43:53] <Bunny351> take what's in srfi-4.scm and extend it to detect (...) vs "..." and do the proper thing?
[00:46:15] <Zipheir> I am overriding ##sys#user-read-hook.  Do you mean to import srfi-4 and dispatch to list->u8vector if (...) is read?
[00:46:23] <Zipheir> That sounds plausible.
[00:46:44] <Bunny351> yes, that's what I meant. you don't need to access any srfi-4 internals
[00:47:02] *** Joins: ente (~daemon@inferno.barfooze.de)
[00:47:08] <Zipheir> Kind of gross to duplicate part of SRFI 4's reader hook, but then, hijacking the reader is kind of dirty work.
[00:47:26] <Zipheir> Bunny351: Thanks.
[00:47:42] <Bunny351> it's not that much code. one only has to make sure the new read-hook is always installed after the old one
[00:47:51] <Bunny351> sure, yw

[01:12:12] <vandusen> [eggs] xj version 1.25 (for CHICKEN 5) has been released
[01:54:07] <Zipheir> Bunny351: How can you make sure of that?
[01:54:19] *** Joins: ZombieChicken (~weechat@user/zombiechicken)
[01:54:52] <Zipheir> The read hook works, but, yes, if someone imports srfi-4 after srfi-207, it breaks.
[01:55:08] <Bunny351> just ensure srfi-4 is loaded/initialized before your read hook (by importing it in the very same file)
[01:55:31] <Bunny351> since you need srfi-4 for a working reader anyway
[01:55:38] <Zipheir> OK, let's try that.
[02:00:07] <Zipheir> It works in csi, but not in compiled code or when running tests. (u8vector) bad argument type - not a list: "foo"
[02:00:41] <Zipheir> The relevant file: http://ix.io/3ITe
[02:02:36] <Zipheir> Clearly the srfi-4 read hook is being reinstated; I'm not sure how to prevent that.
[02:04:54] <wasamasa> did you load your code at compile time with -X ?
[02:04:56] <Bunny351> works for me woth this file. can you run the compiled code you use for testing with "-:d"?
[02:05:07] <Bunny351> with
[02:05:21] <Bunny351> oh, are you using the syntax at compile time?
[02:07:01] <Bunny351> it should show where and when libraries are loaded
[02:07:18] <Zipheir> OK, testing.
[02:08:03] <Zipheir> Ah, loading it with -X works.
[02:08:23] <Bunny351> so you are using it literal position in compiled code?
[02:08:52] <Bunny351> the compiler of course knows nothing about read-hooks it currently compiles
[02:09:59] <Zipheir> I think I get it.
[02:10:52] <Zipheir> Compiling with -X srfi-207.so works, and the bytestring literals are displayed correctly.
[02:13:57] <Zipheir> It still breaks with tests, for some reason.
[02:14:20] <wasamasa> might need to add -X srfi-207 to the egg csc options then
[02:17:30] <Zipheir> Hmm, no luck.
[02:18:19] <Zipheir> It's especially odd because the tests file explicitly imports srfi-207 after srfi-4.
[02:18:33] <Zipheir> And yet it's still using the old hook.
[02:18:44] <Bunny351> srfi-207 needs to import srfi-4
[02:19:36] <Zipheir> It does.
[02:20:06] <Zipheir> The tests file does as well, because srfi-207 doesn't export anything from srfi-4, of course.
[02:20:59] <Bunny351> the first import will load the runtime-code, including the read-hook, so importing 207 should be sufficient
[02:21:18] <Bunny351> at least if the file is interpreted or doesn't use u8" syntax directly
[02:22:26] <Zipheir> So the tests file shouldn't use the #u8"" read syntax?
[02:22:45] <Zipheir> Interestingly, running the tests directly with csi works just fine.
[02:23:19] <Zipheir> Maybe it's the include...
[02:23:51] <Bunny351> the test files are interpreted, I guess, so that should work
[02:24:00] <Zipheir> Running srfi-207-test.scm with csi: fine.  Running run.scm containing the single line (include "srfi-207-test.scm"):  invalid sharp-sign read syntax: #\u
[02:24:27] <wasamasa> does run.scm have the necessary imports?
[02:24:30] <Bunny351> the include reads the whole file before evaluating it
[02:24:36] <Zipheir> Aha.
[02:24:48] <Bunny351> so the read hook is not installed before u8" appears
[02:24:56] <Zipheir> That makes perfect sense.
[02:25:12] <wasamasa> I always stick to the pattern of the included file having no imports
[02:25:16] <Zipheir> So I just have to rewire the way the tests are called slightly.
[02:25:24] <Bunny351> or use load
[02:25:38] <Zipheir> Oh, that's even easier.
[02:26:00] <Zipheir> Indeed, that works.
[02:26:16] <Zipheir> Bunny351, wasamasa: Thanks!
[02:26:47] <Bunny351> not sure if this detail of include is documented well enough...

[16:02:39] <wasamasa> so much better when vandusen prints just one short line, rather than vandusen and judybot doing their back and forth bickering
[16:04:46] <mario-goulart> BTW, I was thinking about changing the captcha to request people to type the name of an egg.
[16:04:52] <wasamasa> wow, you
[16:05:09] <wasamasa> what you gonna do, teach the spammer scheme?
[16:05:21] <wasamasa> but yeah, seems reasonable
[16:07:30] <wasamasa> I wanted to change the code so that it reads a list of regular expressions
[16:07:40] <wasamasa> otherwise the url one won't match
[16:07:45] <mario-goulart> I actually have the code here.  I've modified pastiche a bit -- now it has an "API" for captchas.  I'll wait for C-Keen to handle the current PR I opened some days ago (as my modifications are on top of that).  Also I don't want to overwhelm C-Keen around Christmas.
[16:13:29] <wasamasa> once your code is merged, yes
[16:14:08] <mario-goulart> It wouldn't be wise to bother a Christian around Christmas.
