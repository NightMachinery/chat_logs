[00:38:08] <Slartibart> Is there a way to make composer list the packages it can see in a given repo?

[00:48:16] <__adrian> there's the --tree option, might help
[00:49:13] <__adrian> oh actually you can use --tree along with a package name
[00:49:57] <__adrian> note; this won't tell you whether any other dependencies have any of the same transitive dependencies
[01:03:36] <Slartibart> __adrian: Thanks. So if I run 'composer show --tree <my package name as listed in composer.json>' and get 'Package dws/wp-media-library-categories not found' it's safe to say that either the name is misspelled in composer.json or the bitbucket repo isn't configured to let me in?

[01:07:53] <Slartibart> ..or am I jumping to conclusions?
[01:15:23] <__adrian> did you install yet?
[01:16:20] <__adrian> `show` shows you what's installed. not much value in just reading the composer.json for you
[01:16:39] <__adrian> if you did install and it's not found, then the package isn't installed
[01:17:23] <__adrian> misspelled: maybe? it's not likely to be an auth issue. install would have failed in that case.
[01:21:00] <Slartibart> __adrian: No, not installed, it's a freshly cloned project that I'm trying to get running
[01:21:51] <__adrian> you need to install
[01:22:43] <Slartibart> Simply composer install? Ok, trying that
[01:22:57] <__adrian> depending on the package  ;)  but yes, most likely

[12:10:46] <locsmif> Hi all. Just curious. If all other control flow options seem unable to do the job, is using a jump table ever acceptable?
[12:11:49] <locsmif> Because you could do switch/case and omit the break directive, but then switch/case simply executes the next branches without even checking if the case matches.
[12:13:54] <TinoDidriksen> What job exactly? Got example code?
[12:14:06] <locsmif> The use case is: if no options are specified, do all tasks. If one is specified, do that one specific task and no others. It ends up looking like a list of: if (!$option || $option === 'foo') { .. } .. if (!$option || $option === 'bar') { .. } .. etc
[12:14:30] <locsmif> And I find that structure quite confusing and tedious to look at, especially as it grows

[13:04:51] <Naktibalda> alright, what I expected, but 'all' seems unnecessary if it is the default.

[13:24:47] <locsmif> If so, good point, thanks
[13:30:21] <locsmif> Would a jump table in general be frowned upon though? Something 'not done' so to speak?
[13:32:25] <Naktibalda> I think that it was much more popular in Perl when I was learning it. In PHP is much more common to use naming convention instead of mapping table

[13:53:14] <AllenJB> fakuve: If you are running PHP-FPM, rather than the Apache2 module - mod_php, then the user your PHP scripts run as is controlled by PHP-FPM and configured in the pool configuration (on RedHat distros this is usually in /etc/php-fpm.d/<pool-name>.conf)
[13:53:46] <AllenJB> You can confirm whether you're using the mod_php Apache2 module or PHP-FPM by checking the "Server API" in the top table of the output of phpinfo()

[13:55:11] <fakuve> AllenJB: I'm using `Server API  FPM/FastCGI `
[13:55:23] <AllenJB> What are you trying to achieve / solve by changing the user scripts run as? This is not something you should normally mess with unless you know what you're doing.

[13:57:07] <fakuve> So I can commit backups to my server , and pull data from it as well
[13:57:36] <AllenJB> Note that in PHP scripts you'll often find you have to specify the full path to executables (which you can find with `which <executable>` on linux) because  the PATH is different when running as a web request or cron job

[15:51:53] <AllenJB> You may also wish to read up on Swagger / OpenAPI Spec and the ecosystem around those
[15:52:06] <Blondie101010> that implies documenting the API in the code directly, which is not a bad thing, but it doesn't do that for you automatically
[15:52:39] <velix> Blondie101010: Sure. But that would be fine for me.
[15:52:55] <velix> "in the code directly" might be even better.
[15:53:03] <velix> Since you can easily keep it up to date.
[15:53:18] <velix> AllenJB: So it sounds like it's not that easy.
[15:53:34] <velix> I thought I just set some comments around/in a class or function and a parser does the rest :D
[15:56:45] <Blondie101010> velix:  the thing is, an API is the link between a calling syntax and business logic, and the place where you'd likely define it in the code would only be appropriate for the first part

[19:31:20] <fakuve> Hi guys , this is rather a simple one I guess , this little project , I'm seeing if first I'm actually linking correctly the files . So note in here https://hastebin.com/yojufigike line 49 . Which if I echo it its giving me the full path of the actual `parsingToVituro.php` file , but the webserver is not serving that page `Not found , the requested URL was not found in the server`
[19:32:22] <TinoDidriksen> The URLs you send to the client must be relative to the domain, not the filesystem.
[19:32:29] <fakuve> is it because the $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] has been changed to `./public/` then I wont be able to refer to those files that are not descendant of `./public/` ?
[19:32:37] <fakuve> ok
[19:32:39] <__adrian> src/ is not under your docroot, right?
[19:32:48] <fakuve> yes
[19:32:52] <__adrian> of course the webserver can't serve it (this is expected+desriable)
[19:33:05] <fakuve> So then how can you access this?
[19:33:11] <fakuve> by includes?
[19:33:14] <__adrian> you DON'T WANT web access.
[19:33:21] <TinoDidriksen> Check View Source to see what's actually sent to the client. It must not include /home/ anywhere.
[19:33:39] <__adrian> it's for your application. you require (or autolaod) it when you need it
[19:34:06] <fakuve> __adrian: ok I see
[19:34:08] <__adrian> what's this file contain?
[19:34:23] <__adrian> a template (webpage)? a class definition?
[19:34:55] <fakuve> I was just going to parse there , select and checkboxes , which will prompt the user for parameters to then pass to an script
[19:35:08] <fakuve> a shell script that is waiting in /bin/
[19:35:09] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[19:35:23] <__adrian> so it parses a form submission?
[19:35:29] <fakuve> Yes
[19:35:46] <fakuve> I still havent completed the form , but that is the idea
[19:35:51] <__adrian> is it just php code, or is it part of a "Controller" type class?
[19:36:05] <__adrian> yeah, the <form> itself doesn't matter
[19:36:10] <fakuve> I haven't done that yet
[19:36:33] <fakuve> I have the script , and I have this . I know how to do the form , I will guess how to parse it
[19:37:22] <fakuve> I'm going to check that `Controller` type class cause it may be usefull for me I guess
[19:37:58] <__adrian> a "Controller" (or "Handler") is a class that's meant for handling requests. taking the input, deciding on a response.
[19:38:10] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[19:38:54] <__adrian> if your application is just routing requests to plain php scripts, then you'd handle it a little differently. but it would be worth looking at how existing (micro)frameworks do it.
[19:41:32] <fakuve> Ok
[19:41:52] <fakuve> It is gonna have to route requests to a shell script
[19:42:03] <fakuve> So anyways I'm gonna check into this now thanks
[19:42:50] <__adrian> probably better to have your own controllers, and the action they take is to call your shell script and handle the result
[19:42:55] <__adrian> welcome

[20:58:02] <dag> i watched that yesterday. he seems okay but some red flags. like using variable variables ($$var = 2)
[20:58:44] <dag> fakuve: ^
[20:59:22] <fakuve> wow variable variables give me a break I have to see that with my own eyes
[20:59:47] <dag> also his router only works with static routes like /about  -- but he probably dumbs it down for the tutorial
[21:00:34] <fakuve> I'm trying to understand `callback` functions . https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php . Just , where does the function `call_user_func()` comes from in this example ?
[21:00:35] <dag> also using call_user_func() instead of simply $fn()
[21:01:14] <fakuve> ok is a built in function
[21:01:51] <dag> fakuve: you know regular functions right? in php they can be put inside variables like $callback = function() { return 42; }
[21:02:06] <AllenJB> So you have a problem with variable variables but not variable function calls?
[21:02:11] <dag> so call_user_func($callback) simply invokes the function
[21:02:38] <fakuve> But those callbacks are just mere variables
[21:02:54] <fakuve> fixed to an int, 42 in this case
[21:03:17] <dag> AllenJB: functions in variables are usually const som im fine with it. but i get your point
[21:03:55] <dag> fakuve: like i said, a variable can contain a function value, e.g. a closure
[21:04:31] <fakuve> well because that function is simple (it just returns a fixed int)
[21:05:03] <fakuve> is not $callback = function ($x , $y) { return $x + $y ; }
[21:05:42] <fakuve> I dont see the point of `$callback = function() { return 42; }` when you can `$callback = 42;`
[21:06:30] <dag> thats just an example fakuve. usually there is data in there that is unknown at runtime
[21:09:02] <fakuve> ok
[21:09:31] <dag> fakuve: php is a bit confusing because theres two distinct concepts: callable and closure
[21:10:25] <fakuve> So you can "wrap" the function in a "fake-variable" such as `$callback` and the only way to use that function in that way is to use `call_user_func($callback , $arg1 , $arg2 ...)`
[21:11:43] <fakuve> How on earth you can pass an array to that function ? `call_user_func(array('MyClass', 'myCallbackMethod'));`
[21:11:49] <dag> it's not fake variable. code IS data as we learn in school. you can also invoke it with simply $callback() which is the regular way to invoke functions in php
[21:11:51] <fakuve> as a parameter
[21:12:17] <fakuve> ah ok
[21:12:21] <dag> that array is a callable in php-land
[21:12:59] <dag> callable is a concept in php which includes lots of things. e.g. the string 'strlen' is a callable
[21:14:25] <fakuve> ok I start seeing it

[21:38:50] <__adrian> to be clear, $strlen = "strlen";  echo $strlen("hello"); // 5
[21:39:32] <__adrian> callable === function name|invokable object (e.g., a closure)|[classname, static method]|[object, instance method]
[21:40:11] <Sammitch> because of some fundamental language design choices PHP needs to use a special "callable" type when you need to pass a function as an argument, and the type has various definitions that are a bit odd
[21:40:50] <fakuve> Sammitch: I see
[21:41:21] <fakuve> So basically they are made to be used as function arguments
[21:41:37] <fakuve> (or they are gonna be employed as that)
[21:41:45] <__adrian> "fakuve: But those callbacks are just mere variables"  // no; they're not. there's a difference between "a callback" and "the result of a callback."
[21:41:57] <__adrian> passing a function as a callback does not invoke the function.
[21:42:05] <Sammitch> ^
[21:42:47] <fakuve> ok
[21:43:04] <Sammitch> it's more or less allowing the caller to inject some of its own functionality into the method they're calling
[21:43:42] <Sammitch> in the case of a "callback" it's usually "call this function once you're done your work"
[21:43:44] <fakuve> Ok so it is like doing the architecture of what you are building a bit more modular
[21:44:08] <Sammitch> more or less
[21:44:14] *** Joins: ArchNoob (~maotora@user/archnoob)
[21:44:14] <__adrian> callbacks are for when you want the caller to provide some aspect of the functionality, yes
[21:44:20] <__adrian> e.g., function five(callable $callback) { return $callback(5); }
[21:44:32] <Sammitch> I think a good non-callback example might be usort()
[21:44:48] <__adrian> sure
[21:45:13] <__adrian> but in the above example, you can more clearly see what it's _passed_ to the function (as an argument) vs. when it's actually _invoked_
[21:45:28] <Sammitch> using a callable to give the sort function a custom comparator, rather than entirely re-implementing sort each time you have a new data type to sort
