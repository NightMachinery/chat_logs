[14:14:09] <riv> okay that is helpful
[14:14:17] <riv> I think when I'm doing normal commits on a normal branch
[14:14:41] <riv> it's like a linked list, every commit points to the parent
[14:15:10] <riv> and that is useful for things like finding out how this commit is different to the previous

[14:30:07] <Brekkjern> M O O D
[14:30:08] <kline> riv, a git commit is just a snapshot of the codebase in time, as well as some links to related-in-principle other commits. diffs are generated by comparing these commits
[14:30:21] <riv> I see
[14:30:40] <kline> in principle you could have 100 branches all with the same code, make a new "merge commit", link all 100 previous commits as parents, and have a 0 byte diff
[14:30:41] <riv> so even a merge commit is just a snapshot
[14:30:48] <riv> it just happens to have 3 parents
[14:30:50] <riv> or whateverf
[14:31:05] <kline> yes
[14:31:32] <kline> "octopus merge" is the conventional name for a many-parented commit
[14:31:53] <riv> Lol
[14:32:04] <riv> today seems to be all about octopodes
[14:32:17] <kline> you could for example have 5 separate feature branches in isolation, have them all merge into a single commit on master, and call that commit a release
[14:32:29] <kline> in this way you get all five features landing simultaneously
[14:32:45] <Brekkjern> And then roll back as this clusterfuck of a commit fucks up everything
[14:32:47] <riv> would that be a normal thing to do?
[14:32:50] <riv> LOL
[14:32:53] <kline> for some places, sure
[14:32:55] <riv> I would usually merge one at a time right?
[14:33:05] <riv> clusterfuck is one of my favorite words
[14:33:06] <kline> its all about your workflow of choice
[14:33:12] <riv> it's so accurate when speaking about programming

[14:33:19] <kline> i personally wouldnt want to do it, because it makes identifying which branch broke something
[14:33:34] <kline> if you merge them one at a time its easier to step through them to figure out where the tests failed

[14:34:07] *** Joins: cdown (~cdown@188.214.11.14)
[14:34:43] <riv> I think I understand a merge now
[14:34:59] <riv> I guess the only piece we haven't talked about is how a merge is actually created
[14:35:03] <kline> git is relatively unopinionated, you can do many different workflows and git will do it, the flip side is that by exposing all this (as opposed to having a more opaque/abstracted/opinionated set of tools and standard workflow) is that a lot of the underlying stuff leaks through and you have to know about it to understand it
[14:35:14] <riv> git has to somehow calculate a new repo snapshot state
[14:35:18] <riv> applying 3 way diff?
[14:35:23] <riv> and conflicts occur sometimes
[14:35:35] <riv> I see
[14:36:16] <kline> yeah, so "creating" a merge is just where git tries to figure out the best way to make 1 set of files that incorporate all the state of the parent branches
[14:36:28] <kline> if the branches have non-overlapping state, this is easy
[14:36:52] <kline> if they have non-overlapping state, then you will have to explain to git which side you want to pick from, or manually deconflict
[14:37:23] <riv> yeah
[14:37:30] <riv> I've done the biggest merge I've ever done
[14:37:30] <kline> like, if both branches have file A, then branch-foo adds B, and branch-bar adds C, then the merge is easy, its just files A, B, C in the same dir or whatever
[14:37:42] <riv> and it introduced problems =_=
[14:37:54] <kline> git is extremely un-magic

[17:05:22] <kline> youre joking right
[17:05:36] <riv> is rust bad for portability?
[17:06:07] <kline> gcc has many more targets than rust, yes
[17:06:08] <wink> well it depends
[17:06:13] <reneeontheweb> idk i feel like there's two sides to the coin?
[17:06:17] <wink> if your target is one of 7 archs, it's cool
[17:06:36] <kline> "Why?
[17:06:36] <kline> In short: There's no standard for building C programs. "
[17:06:37] <wink> and you don't need to care about the arch in your rust code
[17:06:44] <kline> thats not what portability means reeee
[17:06:45] <reneeontheweb> C runs on more architectures, but C tends to need more adjustments for that architecture
[17:06:59] <riv> so there are positives and negatives
[17:07:12] <riv> gcc: more targets, harder to use.  rust: less targets, easier to use
[17:07:18] <wink> kline: well it kinda does for some people. linux-arm mac is already portable
[17:07:35] <kline> wink, this rust code does need to care about the arch, essentially all that theyve done is outsource the hard bits into other peoples crates
[17:07:41] <kline> which rust does make easier
[17:07:49] <wink> I didn't say they did a good job
[17:08:04] <riv> that is the definition of good engineering right?
[17:08:05] <wink> but in general.. rust is higher level so you /can/ ignore the arch stuff
[17:08:07] <riv> software engineering
[17:08:13] <kline> im not suggesting you did, just "you can ignore the arch stuff"
[17:08:16] <kline> i dont think thats true
[17:08:29] <kline> the code still needs to care about it
[17:08:31] <wink> depends if you write a webserver or a libc
[17:08:47] <wink> I'd say your rust webserver should be arch-agnostic
[17:08:48] <kline> just youre using other peoples black boxes for it
[17:08:48] <kline> they could notionally have done this in the C code as well
[17:08:53] <riv> I dont really follow, he says it's the same algorithm
[17:09:01] <riv> it's just compiler/codegen that cares about arch?
[17:09:04] <wink> yeah, I am not debating that in c you also should not care
[17:09:17] <wink> but good luck doing this event thing on windows for example
[17:09:30] <kline> riv, one of the things they talk about is parallelising strategy, for example with threading/openmp
[17:09:32] <wink> shouldn't rust abstract that away? vs libuv being a pain?
[17:09:48] <kline> this is what is hard about different arches and oses
[17:09:51] <kline> they have different ways of doing this
[17:09:53] <wink> I'm rusty (pun not intended) on the details

[17:10:25] <kline> but essentially all theyve done is said "openmp is hard, lets go shopping [for crates]"
[17:10:46] <kline> the codes not any simpler, theyve just moved some of the work onto someone elses plate
[17:11:15] <kline> im not sure how this will work out in the long run for rust, im not sure anyone would say its been a blinding success for js (with npm modules)
[17:11:45] <wink> kline: I actually think it's a bit of a philosophical question. but my (been a while) experience is that for, say a daemon, in C you get into ifdef hell for posix/windows - and in rust you could actually get by with better abstraction
[17:12:23] <wink> then again I did not write such low-level stuff in rust
[17:12:28] <kline> wink, i think its apples to oranges. if you look at how the rust implementations do it, you're probably going to see a lot of the same arch dependent switching
[17:12:31] <riv> the code is the same algorithm, around the same number of lines of code.. but in a different language

[17:14:02] <riv> reneeontheweb: which message was yours a reply to?
[17:14:07] <kline> the thing here is that what theyve esssentially said is "im going to make my code portable my moving the hard bits about portability into someone elses problem, and end up able to target fewer platforms, but make my code look pretty"
[17:14:08] <reneeontheweb> kline

[17:15:04] <kline> its easier for this author to be portable, because the portability issue is no longer their problem, fine
[17:15:17] <kline> but in the end the problems dont really go away, youre just hiding from them
[17:15:18] <riv> I think that is good?
[17:15:27] <kline> and the net result in numbers is a less portable library
[17:15:38] <riv> you have a compiler that handles compiling code to multiple arches, separate from your code

[17:21:03] <riv> tbh
[17:21:05] <kline> theres two ways to interpret "portability" here: one is "is the code applicable to multiple platforms" - to which the answer is "not any more so that previously", because all theyve done is move the hard bits about dealing with different arches into a different bit of the architecture
[17:21:08] <riv> you could take the language out of the equation
[17:21:21] <kline> the other is "how many targets can i hit": and the answer to that is "objectively fewer than with C"
[17:21:26] <riv> "we switched out the parallelism lib, now the thing is easier to work with"
[17:21:41] <kline> yeah
[17:21:59] <kline> but theyve not made the overall library any more portable, its in fact less portable
[17:22:02] <riv> I think rust is based on llvm, so the targets are the llvm targets?
[17:22:07] <riv> and it's fewer than gcc for sure
[17:22:08] <kline> (unless you only look at a very small part of the puzzle)
[17:22:36] <riv> but are there any targets missing that are a problem?
[17:22:36] <kline> rust is based on llvm, but that doesnt mean things like the runtime etc are ported
[17:22:48] <riv> oh so rust can target even less than llvm can, ok
[17:22:52] <kline> yeah
[17:23:10] <reneeontheweb> yeah i suppose "rust is more portable" is a pretty bad title for it, that's fair
[17:23:33] <riv> it's more about being easier to cross compiler
[17:23:34] <kline> llvm can codegen for a bunch of different things, but that doesnt mean very much if rusts tear down and setup code at the start of an individual exection havent been ported
[17:23:34] <reneeontheweb> more like "we rubbed some rust on it and now cross-compiling is less annoying because integrated toolchain"
[17:23:37] <companion_cube> that's the theory, but then it could be that rust programs in practice are more portable
[17:23:38] <riv> yep
[17:23:42] <companion_cube> (esp. on windows)
[17:23:50] <riv> I see
[17:24:38] <wink> I read the zig manifesto yesterday and the part about LLVM seemed really.. wow

[17:26:18] <wink> they are patting themselves on the back quite a bit
[17:26:22] <riv> there isn't much mention of llvm though?
[17:26:48] <wink> ye sorry then it was a link from somewhere
[17:26:58] <wink> it's about the amount of targets they provide

[17:27:12] <wink> where you can compile C code with it
[17:27:16] <riv> oh yeah
[17:27:21] <wink> so it's like a bit of an llvm wrapper

[19:25:13] <gwozniak> it's .git/refs, as I recall, that contains all the commit ids for the branches, and .git/HEAD tells you the head of the current branch, and the branch name

[20:01:55] <bkhl> Probably unusual though not to have a budget set in advance of hiring someone, so it should be possible to give an upper bound.
[20:02:05] <bkhl> At least if you're at a workplace big enough to have departments.
[20:03:16] <varjag> if you announce the upper bound people take it as a starter for negotiating :p
[20:04:15] <ngoldbaum> Church: imo all job ads should come with salary bands

[20:04:46] <riv> what If I make a new branch and I want to just add 1 commit from another branch to this?
[20:04:51] <companion_cube> what's the downside of announcing a really high upper bound?
[20:04:58] <varjag> govt positions here usually list salary ranges for position, but they are fairly rigid by the virtue of being a govt
[20:05:02] <ngoldbaum> riv: git cherry-pick
[20:06:16] <ngoldbaum> hot take: all jobs should be like that, it shouldn’t be possible for two people to be paid wildly different salaries for the same role because of secrecy
[20:06:34] <epilys> "negotiating" salary is a facade to hide the fact that as an employee you lack power to define how much you sell your labor for
[20:07:24] <bkhl> I'm a fan of the so called "register" method used (primarily) in some places where syndicalist unions or dominant.
[20:07:41] <bkhl> Basically it's a list on the union notice board where everyone writes up their current salary.
[20:07:44] *** Joins: the_lanetly_052 (~the_lanet@194.135.166.214)
[20:07:53] <varjag> imo it's not that simple… there's often a seller's market and then you absolutely can negotiate
[20:08:56] <bkhl> Seems people have been negotiating pretty badly the last few decades in the western world though, since the salaries have not kept pace with productivity at all.
[20:09:10] <epilys> how can you negotiate without knowing what the company pays?
[20:09:34] <bkhl> The point of the register method I mentioned is to give everyone the ability to negotiate with better information.
[20:10:08] <bkhl> (So it's kind of an alternative to collective bargaining in places where the employers are not interested in collective agreements.)
[20:10:29] <varjag> epilys: company "pays" what the market offers atm
[20:10:31] <Church> ngoldbaum: Oh I don't disagree, they should come with pay bands.
[20:10:39] <varjag> you're not getting 10x salary of one place over another
[20:10:49] <varjag> at least over here
[20:10:49] <indigo> I thought the best way to negotiate is to get multiple data points (eg. multiple offers)
[20:11:21] <varjag> so if you have a strong hand (e.g. being a javascript dev with experience in 2021) you have several competing offers and have a lot of leverage
[20:11:44] <feoh> Compensation in hiring is just weird and IMO the current system is weighted against the employee. I kinda hate it even though I wouldn't want to give out what I make. As much because I think it might be low for my years of experience as the other way around.
[20:11:47] <varjag> enough so that lowballing won't work
[20:12:12] <bkhl> There was one KPI in myh previous department which I thought was kind of funny and/or depressing.
[20:12:18] <epilys> so what you're saying in reply to the fact that the company holds all information, is to probe as many companies as possible for what they hypothetically can pay you
[20:12:47] <bkhl> I was in PS, and they had revenue per employee as a KPI and regularly reported stat that they reported in all-staff meetings.
[20:12:52] <varjag> what i am saying is that most small/medium companies don't have salary tables
[20:13:26] <varjag> they certainly try to get the labor as cheap as they get, BUT in a hot market they can't get it particularly cheap
[20:13:52] <bkhl> Well, in our business it's still super cheap compared to the normal revenue per employee.
[20:14:45] <epilys> I don't find it wise to put any "but" in this kind of unfairness
[20:14:45] <varjag> i dunno, like most of startups (prime consumers of said js devs) can't revenue for shit
[20:15:53] <bkhl> Yeah, I'm thinking of the expected return of investment for software sales in larger companies.

[20:16:24] <feoh> I like to cite my first experience in tech as an example. This was back in 1990 so prepare to chuckle at the amounts - but before I had my very first interview, the guy I was going to work for had decided that it was an entry level gig and he was going to pay me 25K. I was SO INCREDIBLY PAINFULLY OBVIOUSLY EAGER AND DESPERATE to get the job that he
[20:16:24] <feoh> ended up offering me 23K instead and admitted as much later.
[20:16:37] <feoh> IMO that says everything about hiring and salary.
[20:17:03] <feoh> Don't be a jerk but don't ever undersell yourself either or the market will happily oblige and underpay you.
[20:17:09] <drobilla> ^ how this actually works
[20:17:19] <varjag> right
[20:18:52] <bkhl> I just got the promise of a kind of retention bonus today.
[20:19:04] <feoh> Pay negotiations are among the many things I will be SO INCREDIBLY happy and relieved to be rid of when I can retire.
[20:19:11] <bkhl> Two months extra salary by the end of the year provided I don't resign before December 1.
[20:19:22] <epilys> varjag, that's called "crab mentality"
[20:19:28] <feoh> bkhl: Nice! Although those are some serious weasel words there "a kind of" retention bonus? Are they offering you the options crack pipe? :)
[20:19:43] <bkhl> No, no, I guess I shouldn't have said kind of.

[20:19:55] <drobilla> Yeah, it's the worst.  Really this system is "whoever has the most egregiously massive ego and likes negotating makes the most money", which is... not a good system?
[20:20:22] <ngoldbaum> also lots of opportunities for bias to come in
[20:20:25] <drobilla> We somehow simultaneously have that, and also asking about salary "too early" being considered a gigantic black mark on an applicant
[20:20:34] <ngoldbaum> “of this person has kids so we have to pay them more”
[20:20:36] <varjag> epilys: as opposed to "wishful thinking"
[20:21:02] <epilys> silly me I guess
[20:21:02] <feoh> drobilla: It's pretty terrible, but on the other hand it's also understanding how to be successful in microcosm. You cannot succeed in industry unless you have enough self confidence and ability to properly market yourself and manage the perception of you that others around you, above and below, have.
[20:21:45] <feoh> drobilla: IMO asking about salary range early-ish isn't taboo. If someone ditches you because of that it's a red flag and RUN.
[20:22:33] <drobilla> feoh: Shouldn't be, perhaps...
[20:22:46] <imode> how dare you assume we'll pay you.
[20:23:03] <feoh> This is a commercial transaction with the goal being the exchange of money for work between you and your employer. All of the claptrap about meritocracies and family and loyalty are smoke some people blow in the faces of the unwary to exploit them.
[20:23:05] <imode> you have to fake being enthusiastic about the job hard enough for us to even consider paying you.
[20:23:23] <feoh> Yes I'm totally cynical but my cynicism is borne of 35 years of experience :)
[20:23:23] <drobilla> feoh: It certainly can be a red flag, but I think that one's pretty complicated.  It obviously can be super toxic (e.g. startup culture), but "we want people into this work, not people who just want a pay check and don't care about the work at all" isn't all bad

[22:38:53] <jlindgren> i actually have a question - is there a weird disparity between some positions for you guys at your companies? for ref: we have associate, SE, SSE, Principal, Senior Principal, fellow. for us theres a HUGE gap between associate and SE, like an associate is basically an intern, or worse. then once you get to SE it isn't a huge gap to senior, then
[22:38:53] <jlindgren> between senior and principal its a huge gap again
[22:38:58] <jlindgren> just curious if thats similar for others
[22:39:33] *** Joins: jormick (~jormick@172.58.43.9)
[22:39:45] <c355E3B> We split have a branch at senior where it goes SSE or Principal.
[22:39:57] <wink> I've never been at a place that anything above senior.
[22:40:01] <pretty_dumm_guy> Hmm. I wish there were nation wide standards like the TV-L in Germany. Would make everything explicit. And Salary negotiations would be gone so to say
[22:40:06] <c355E3B> and I've held the associate title when I was part time for audit compliance.
[22:40:25] <technomancy> where I am, Staff Engineer is the highest level where you're on one team; I've specifically avoided going to Senior Staff because once you're over multiple teams most of your work is politics and not technical.
[22:40:35] <wink> pretty_dumm_guy: TV-L only works one way, this should be bidirectional
[22:40:53] <pretty_dumm_guy> wink: one way ? I dont follow
[22:41:27] <gwozniak> As a principle more is expected of me from a design perspective, that is, any design documents I write shouldn't need excessive vetting
[22:41:39] <wink> pretty_dumm_guy: if you are, say E14 then that says nothing about your standing in the org. but for some orgs, to be head of team/division/whatever you need to be E14
[22:41:39] <feoh> Yeah like ngoldbaum said mostly larger companies have the idea of a tech leadership track
[22:41:54] <gwozniak> With juniors, design docs are going to be gone over many times, most likely
[22:42:01] <jlindgren> technomancy: agree, it would start being less fun if its all politics
[22:42:04] <wink> pretty_dumm_guy: also in one org it starts at X and at the other it starts at Y. so it doesn't help

[22:42:29] <jlindgren> also how a senior qe engineer is mostly about similar to a sotware engineer here at least.
[22:42:41] <jlindgren> like a principal QE is probably equivalent to a senior software
[22:43:36] <pretty_dumm_guy> wink: thats true. However, for a given job description, lets say if one company offers E13 and other E14, it becomes more easier to evaluate right ? I am talking about this mostly from the job posting perspective.

[23:29:37] <technomancy> hopefully they can get therapy and move on to a brighter future
[23:30:32] <gwozniak> I find the 'configure; make; make install' *interface* is okay.  But underneath is pretty terrible
[23:30:51] <feoh> ha
[23:30:55] <feoh> Yup
[23:31:18] <imode> the underneath looks horrifying.
[23:31:25] <feoh> technomancy: I guess the question I have is. If you were starting a new project today in C, and wanted it to run across most POSIX-y environments, what tools would you use instead?
[23:31:35] <gwozniak> Then again, I'm okay with the CMake interface too
[23:31:56] <technomancy> feoh: "starting a new project today in C" lmao never gonna happen
[23:32:01] <companion_cube> feoh: heh, yes
[23:32:09] <gwozniak> Please don't start a new project in C
[23:32:22] <feoh> technomancy: Dangit you beat me to the "I'd use LISP Instead" punch :)
[23:32:50] <technomancy> I don't want to say "literally any other language" but ... yeah, basically almost that
[23:32:51] <imode> gwozniak: what should I start one in then.
[23:32:57] <feoh> companion_cube: I finally switched from The Silver Surfer to Ripgrep and it has been impressing the crud out of me ever since.
[23:33:13] <imode> everything else looks like hobby projects.
[23:33:18] <companion_cube> yeah rg is just amazing
[23:33:27] <companion_cube> burntsushi is a hell of a good coder
[23:33:28] <feoh> technomancy: Nothing wrong with authentically loving your favorie tools. I feel that way about Python *ducks*
[23:34:25] *** Quits: rb (~augh@theguntretort.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:34:44] <feoh> I just learned Javascript and am giving that a bit to gestate but I suspect in a year or two when I allow myself another language to learn it'll be Racket. I've been hearing nothing but good about and from that community for years.
[23:35:04] <rbasak> The advantage of autotools is that it (generally correctly) supports all the use cases.
[23:35:22] <rbasak> Nearly any alternative you might pick does not support some use case or other.
[23:35:40] <technomancy> rbasak: that's awfully vague
[23:35:53] *** Joins: rwb (~augh@theguntretort.com)
[23:36:01] <wink> *insert spacebar heating xkcd*
[23:36:07] <technomancy> "all the use cases" isn't something that has a meaningful definition
[23:36:08] <rbasak> It's what I mean though
[23:36:14] <rbasak> It might well not be a use case that you care about.
[23:36:26] <technomancy> it doesn't run on an apple //e
[23:36:39] <rbasak> But for a public project, sooner or later someone will probably come along and complain about something that is a consequence of a choice not to use autotools (in a C project that might have done).
[23:38:15] <rbasak> So yes, I'm not defining it - because it's an "unknown unknown".
[23:38:31] <technomancy> it can solve every problem except the problem of "autotools sucks"
[23:39:00] <technomancy> why make everyone suffer just for one random complainer
[23:39:20] <scubagear[m]> I liked Racket when I played with it. Also seems like you could make closed source software with it, as you can compile procedures to native code iirc
[23:39:44] <imode> no seriously, what should I use instead of C.
[23:40:07] <imode> zig doesn't seem stable yet, rust is.. rust.
[23:40:10] <technomancy> imode: the idea that you could pick a language without knowing the problem is kind of silly
[23:40:18] <iDrougge> imode: B.
[23:40:22] <iDrougge> Or BCPL.
[23:40:32] <rbasak> Sometimes systems "suck" _because_ they implement all the use cases correctly. So then people complain, rewrite it "better" but deferring those cases. Then they rediscover all the same problems and end up "sucking" themselves anyway.
[23:40:33] <imode> iDrougge: I wouldn't hate it, probably.
[23:40:46] <feoh> scubagear[m]: I like the fact that it bundles its own IDE so I could learn it and avoid using emacs :) I love emacs but it's like getting someone with an addictive personality to try opiates. I get sucked down the infinite rabbit hole of customization and lose time like a mofo :)
[23:40:49] <technomancy> different languages are good at different things I guess?
[23:40:51] <mockturtle> Perl warnings and the warn function [perl] (mjgardner) https://lobste.rs/s/jfj3mj
[23:40:55] <imode> technomancy: what about embedded schtuff.
[23:41:03] <rbasak> IOW, what people are complaining about is the complexity of the problem being solved, but misattribute it to the consequent complexity of the solution.
[23:41:07] <technomancy> imode: I wrote a keyboard firmware in microscheme; it was awesome
[23:41:07] <imode> not a desktop app.
[23:41:16] <feoh> imode: Maybe Rust?
[23:41:28] <imode> meh. if I can keep ignoring that language, I will.

[23:41:41] <technomancy> forth is a great choice for embedded work
[23:41:43] <imode> the language itself is actually pretty slick.
[23:41:43] <feoh> Because it changes too quickly? A valid concern.
[23:41:47] <iDrougge> What does your platform vendor support?
[23:41:56] <technomancy> but microcontrollers is basically teh one place where using C for a new project isn't irresponsible
[23:41:59] <imode> assume some flavor of AVR, I guess.
[23:42:06] <technomancy> as long as you're not handling potentially-hostile input

[23:43:06] <companion_cube> technomancy: at what point is it more reasonable to write a new complie-to-C language though
[23:43:25] <companion_cube> especially if you target the shitty C subset that your microcontroller vendor supports
[23:43:57] <gwozniak> Pretty much all the embedded projects by our customers use an IDE of some kind, and don't use autotools to my knowledge (and it's all in C)
[23:43:59] <technomancy> companion_cube: way too much missing context required to answer that question responsibly
[23:44:07] <imode> actually let's give rust its due, does it suck hard for bare metal implementations yet.
[23:44:14] <imode> err, does it not suck hard
[23:44:14] <feoh> technomancy: You programmed your... Keyboard! in Lisp. That is simultaneously frightening and awesome :)
[23:44:45] <technomancy> feoh: I also had one written in forth but it wouldn't run in 2.5kb of ram
[23:44:47] <feoh> Which LISP variant runs on keyboard firmware?
[23:44:47] <imode> I had some fierce objections to how they structured core.

[23:45:21] <companion_cube> imode: what's wrong with core? I've never looked at anything but std in rust
[23:45:40] <imode> companion_cube: there was a fascinating corner of how they implemented certain.. I think it was operators.
[23:45:40] <technomancy> lol of course microscheme is compiled
[23:45:54] <imode> where you had to shim a dummy implementation of a trait in order for things to typecheck properly.
[23:46:00] <imode> leading to questions of "what about XYZ platforms".

[23:47:06] <imode> that and retroforth.
[23:47:21] <technomancy> feoh: the guy who made enforth specifically made it because I was asking in forth if it was possible
[23:47:50] <technomancy> everyone was like "probably not, but maybe ??? if you're super clever?"
[23:47:52] <feoh> I'm so far away from the low level stuff. Hats off to you all for being interested in all of it. I like things with high level of abstraction. Give me legos I can fling together quickly to build solutions. Yes, I know this means I'm not a Real Programmer (TM) and I'm OK with that :)
[23:48:02] <feoh> Nice!
[23:48:11] <technomancy> microscheme has lambdas and stuff
[23:48:32] <technomancy> but its GC is just "every time you go thru this loop imma set the heap pointer back to where it started so if you want anything to stick around you better preallocate it"
[23:48:38] <technomancy> which is genius and insane

[23:53:39] <imode> I'm trying to find the original SO post that actually documented the issue.
[23:54:36] <imode> if you were going without libcore for a new platform, you had to implement dummy traits for primitive types.
[23:55:11] <companion_cube> oh, _without_ libcore, that's hardcore :p
[23:55:23] <companion_cube> well you needed all the Add<> and stuff for integers, no?

[23:56:37] <imode> so why provide a dummy implementation.
