[05:24:09] <causative_> I think the thing to look at is social status.  People censure injustice because by doing so they affirm their social status and help to position themselves socially above those who commit injustice.
[05:24:28] <causative_> there are other reasons but that's a major one
[05:25:29] <causative_> We describe this as "having self-respect" - i.e. a person will refuse to commit a crime, because he has self-respect (read: a feeling of high social status), and wishes to preserve his self-respect
[05:25:56] <causative_> he feels like committing a crime would "lower" himself socially
[05:26:54] <causative_> it would damage his positive self-image, which is also the image he tries to project socially
[05:35:22] <Panther> So there is only extrinsic motivation to be good?
[05:37:01] <causative_> no, there are other reasons
[05:37:29] <causative_> people have an instinctive aversion to certain acts
[05:37:56] <causative_> and people have been culturally indoctrinated from childhood to favor some acts and disfavor others
[05:37:57] <Panther> Like spontaneous human combustion?
[05:38:22] * Panther has an aversion to that.
[05:38:52] <causative_> although, childhood cultural indoctrination has a lot to do with forming the social self-image that the person later has "self-respect" about
[05:39:04] <causative_> so they aren't really that separate
[05:39:30] <Panther> What about people who resist that indoctrination?
[05:40:02] <causative_> depends
[05:40:18] <causative_> they might become serial killers or other types of criminals
[05:40:22] <Panther> For example, because they tend to not be pliable when it comes to being told what to do.
[05:41:17] <causative_> no one fully avoids cultural indoctrination - who you are is a product of who you grew up around
[05:41:31] <causative_> though some people may rebel against certain parts of it
[05:41:58] <Panther> They could also discover an intrinsic motivation to be good. A piece that is attached firmly to their identity and character.
[05:42:23] <causative_> well, that sounds a lot like the "self-respect" motivation I was just talking about
[05:43:17] <causative_> A person may think of himself as an honest person, which he likes because it makes him think he's better than dishonest people (social status) - thus he will refuse to lie, to avoid damaging his self-image of honesty
[05:43:45] <causative_> honesty for this person is firmly attached to his identity and character
[05:43:52] <causative_> but it's also all about social status
[05:44:47] <Panther> This is some dialogue from a film:
[05:45:01] <Panther> It's so with men.
[05:45:01] <Panther> I will not give in, because I oppose it.
[05:45:02] <Panther> Not my pride, not my spleen,
[05:45:02] <Panther> nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.
[05:45:17] <Panther> Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
[05:45:17] <Panther> no sinew that serves no appetite...
[05:45:17] <Panther> ...of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
[05:45:17] <Panther> There is!
[05:45:17] <Panther> -Give that some exercise, my lord!
[05:45:43] <causative_> A second person may think of himself as a tough-minded guy who does whatever it takes to get what he can, which he likes because it makes him think he's better than naive people - thus he will commit crimes and lie whenever it benefits him, also to avoid damaging his self-image
[05:45:44] <Panther> :)
[05:46:16] <Panther> ppl who do those things are weak.
[05:46:31] <causative_> calling them weak is an attempt to disparage their social status
[05:46:47] <Panther> No, it is analysis of them as human beings.
[05:47:14] <causative_> and also an attempt to disparage their social status
[05:47:42] * Panther cares not one farthing about their status, social or otherwise.
[05:48:00] <causative_> if someone is weak, that does not refute their beliefs, it only makes them look bad, socially
[05:48:18] <Panther> As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
[05:48:42] <Panther> I didn't make things that way, but it is how they are.

[05:49:28] <Panther> If they don't have enough social staus, it's because they didn't do what it took, for te most part.
[05:49:59] <causative_> and why do you think it matters if they have social status or don't, or if they did or didn't do "what it took"?
[05:50:08] <Panther> I don't
[05:50:12] <causative_> then why did you mention it?
[05:50:32] <Panther> It is only another analysis.
[05:51:25] <causative_> about your quote, I would say that Norfolk is his appetites; that is, the person is the goals and dreams to which he aspires
[05:51:43] <causative_> everything else about the person is an instrument of those goals and dreams
[05:52:05] <Panther> That is from my favorite filk, which is also a play: A Man For All Seasons
[05:52:49] <Panther> I think I'll get someone to watch that with me again soon.
[05:53:29] <causative_> in the same way an axe is an instrument to fell a tree - the person is the desire. Associated with the person we also have the person's physical strength, his height, his mental faculties, his culture, his religion, and so forth.  All these other factors are instruments that serve his desires.
[05:54:02] <causative_> everything about a person is only an instrument of some desire - except the desires themselves (or rather - except for the most central, core desires)

[14:26:54] <tomathy> i suppose though we are also our agency so maybe i'm wrong

[15:35:12] <arryana> my guests had a bit of adventure yesterday
[15:35:26] <arryana> they were sightseeing in glasgow when the march caught up to them
[15:35:32] <arryana> (they're fine)
[15:35:57] <pussipupu> Some COP related protests?
[15:36:02] * arryana nods
[15:36:19] <pussipupu> Seems likely to be mostly pretty good natured
[15:36:23] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: my karma ran over your dogma)
[15:36:33] <pussipupu> I'd worry more about the policing to be honest
[15:36:37] <arryana> so they grabbed a train back here and we had peaceful bonfire night backyard barbecue sorts of activities

[15:36:55] <arryana> the police were very gentle, as the protesters were largely children
[15:37:14] <arryana> what i was worried about would be drunk glaswegians on bonfire nightt
[15:37:35] <arryana> but they had extreme presence and were shutting things down early so that couldn't get ugly

[15:38:15] <arryana> today we did the full english, and now they're napping

[18:35:44] <Varde> Is math knowledge of knowledges?
[18:36:24] <darklambda> is math a science? yes
[18:36:37] <darklambda> science is also a body of knowledge
[18:36:45] <Varde> I figure this because a net of a cube when measured has a second, hypothetical, net.
[18:37:15] <Varde> Cool.
[18:38:32] <Varde> All knowledge can be simplified to number systems?

[18:39:28] <Varde> Or, rather, not knowledge but information.
[18:39:51] <mannequin> a set of informations is knowledge
[18:40:50] <Varde> Ideal because that means if I want to use all of what I know, that is me doing math...
[18:41:13] <Varde> Generally speaking that is.
[18:43:19] <Varde> Philosophy is a command. Science is a process. Mathematics is a???
[18:45:44] <Varde> In science we make theories(I'd argue that this phase is philosophy), and then proceed to produce experiments, exploiting objects for specimen to examine to find if our theories are correct.
[18:46:49] <Varde> Theorizing isn't a process, it's command of processes.
[18:47:19] <Varde> And math, math is a combination of the two so I'd call it 'control'.
[18:47:25] <mannequin> in school we were told math is mother of all science, all i can say
