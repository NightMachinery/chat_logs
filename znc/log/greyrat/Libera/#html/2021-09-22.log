[16:54:29] <fedorafan> hey guys
[16:55:08] <fedorafan> can i use a website to transmit the ip (whatever technique) dynamic ip as server
[17:02:18] <Pilum> Transmit what IP where?
[17:02:22] <Pilum> Anyway, not with HTML.
[17:03:42] <fedorafan> method getIP() {magic; return ip} something like that
[17:04:00] <fedorafan> what do you have rest?
[17:04:36] <fedorafan> not with java ok java script or php?
[17:04:40] <fedorafan> ehm
[17:04:43] <fedorafan> not html
[17:05:13] <stenno> a server 'broadcasting' its ip address doesn't make sense because you need the IP address to talk to the server in the first place
[17:05:17] <stenno> or maybe i am missing something
[17:05:52] <fedorafan> ah no the url exists and i can go onto the site
[17:06:03] <fedorafan> i just want to use it as an ip caster?
[17:06:03] <stenno> and you want what now?
[17:06:09] <stenno> not sure what that is
[17:06:13] <fedorafan> oh man
[17:06:23] <fedorafan> its like someone got a receipt you ask him he tells you
[17:06:34] <fedorafan> A asks B and B give A the information
[17:06:37] <fedorafan> do you know coding?
[17:06:50] <stenno> yes, i know coding
[17:06:52] <fedorafan> ok
[17:07:06] <fedorafan> so its like calling a simple method that returns a value
[17:07:18] <fedorafan> im within the code and know the url
[17:07:21] <fedorafan> and now what to do
[17:07:34] <stenno> you want to call a remote function on the other server?
[17:07:41] <stenno> i still don't get it
[17:07:46] <fedorafan> oh god
[17:07:58] <fedorafan> i want whateve solution probably there are a dozen
[17:08:06] <stenno> FOR WHICH PROBLEM
[17:08:11] <stenno> you don't make sense in the slightest
[17:08:17] <fedorafan> making the website giving me a number
[17:08:19] <stenno> fedorafan | can i use a website to transmit the ip (whatever technique) dynamic ip as server
[17:08:24] <fedorafan> yeah
[17:08:28] <fedorafan> tansmit the ip
[17:08:29] <stenno> ok so you need a server side language and then a http server
[17:08:30] <fedorafan> telling the ip
[17:08:33] <stenno> which ip
[17:08:34] <fedorafan> return ip:
[17:08:40] <fedorafan> return "123.123.123.123"
[17:08:43] <fedorafan> man
[17:08:48] <stenno> the ip of the client?
[17:08:56] <fedorafan> the ip that i hardcoded
[17:09:20] <stenno> ah 'the ip dynamic ip' is a hardcoded ip
[17:09:30] <fedorafan> yeah
[17:09:35] <fedorafan> and cause it can change
[17:10:02] <stenno> how can you ask the server if you don't know the IP?
[17:10:14] <fedorafan> forget it im done
[17:10:15] <stenno> if the IP changes because its dynamic, you cannot reach the server unless you know the IP
[17:10:22] <fedorafan> i wait for another one thanks

[17:10:32] <stenno> yeah, i think you need some serious basic knowledge regarding web servers
[17:10:40] <stenno> and how the web works
[17:10:48] <stenno> this is certainly not a topic of #html
[17:11:01] <stenno> if you want to do something with a webserver, check out #httpd or #nginx
[17:11:27] <fedorafan> ok thaks
[17:11:50] <stenno> you also should check out what 'DNS' is
[17:12:03] <fedorafan> yeah its someting like that
[17:13:11] <stenno> but i assume your question will resolve itself after you understand the concept of http and servers and IPs and DNS
[17:13:19] <fedorafan> oh god
[17:13:23] <fedorafan> i told you want i want to do
[17:13:26] <fedorafan> and dont teach me

[17:13:34] <fedorafan> stop that

[19:58:22] <stenno> i implied some namecalling though :P
[19:58:33] <bin> he was not making sense. he wants to use html (hypertext markup language) to... "transmit" the IP which I genuinely do not understand 
[19:58:37] <bin> lol fair but still
[19:58:46] <stenno> he later moved to #httpd
[19:58:50] <bin> lol

[21:43:52] <lantech19446> I'm trying to add a responsive image to my site at work, I followed the guide in google developers but it's not showing up a different size and I've scaled it by half its display size so it should look different unless I'm missing something telling it to fill which is altogether possible and I only just thought of that so I'll go look in a moment. Can someone just double check my code for mistakes?
