[00:36:29] * manicennui learns about a new fucked up thing on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStratPros/
[00:36:30] <buttsbot> Female Dating Strategy (Pros)
[00:37:48] <manicennui> Is this like the female version of incels?

[00:39:04] <buttsbot> Reddit's Female Dating Strategy, Advice for 'Queens'
[00:42:28] <gerikson> jfc I'm so happy I managed to find a wife
[00:43:01] <gerikson> also I need to work harder in order to keep staying married
[00:43:06] <manicennui> heh
[00:43:15] <manicennui> Are you a High Value Male or a Low Value Male?
[00:43:36] <gerikson> middle value I think
[00:43:56] <gerikson> I'm not a slacker, I can hold down a job, I'm not entirely selfish
[00:44:42] <gerikson> but I am not Elon Musk
[00:45:26] <bkero> At least you have that going for you
[00:46:13] <vladimyr> Lucky you I doubt many women find him attractive
[00:46:20] <gerikson> heh
[00:46:27] <gerikson> he's been married... 4 times?
[00:46:56] <manicennui> And has 6 children.
[00:47:02] <manicennui> He has already won.
[00:47:56] <vladimyr> But is he on irc?
[00:48:07] <manicennui> He would probably use matrix.
[00:48:57] * vladimyr removes element from all devices
[00:49:02] <manicennui> Chief among the dating books recommended by the subreddit is 2002's Why Men Love Bitches, which advertises a guided journey from “doormat” to “dreamgirl.” Many FDS principles can be drawn to the book, from having a man pay for a date to using sex as a tool. “Every man wants to have sex first; whether he wants a girlfriend is something he thinks about later,” writes author Sherry Argov. “By not giving him what
[00:49:02] <manicennui> he wants up front, you become his girlfriend without him realizing it.”
[00:49:57] <manicennui> I'm so confused. They saw this movement is a reaction to red pill nonsense, but this shit seems just as toxic.
[00:50:02] <manicennui> s/saw/say/
[00:50:25] <vladimyr> But it is also hilarious :D
[00:50:41] <manicennui> It's women talking about men the way red pill men talk about women.
[00:51:20] <manicennui> Having “standards” frequently manifests on FDS as adhering to old-fashioned courtship ideals, like a man taking a woman out on a nice dinner date, opening the door for her, and speaking on her behalf to the waiter.
[00:51:30] <manicennui> ?!
[00:51:58] <manicennui> Like I can almost understand the first two, but talking to the waiter on her behalf?
[00:52:02] <manicennui> Is he dating a child?
[00:52:10] <edk> shrug
[00:52:18] <gerikson> but is the (pros) subreddit the same, or a parody?
[00:52:20] <edk> crazy people gon' be crazy
[00:52:24] <edk> you don't need to care about them
[00:52:30] <manicennui> gerikson: I honestly can't tell.
[00:52:49] <manicennui> edk: I do need to be entertained, and these crazies are kind of interesting.
[00:52:50] <vladimyr> Maybe he is dating mail ordered bride
[00:53:12] <manicennui> This is another of their subreddits: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/
[00:53:12] <buttsbot> reddit.com: over 18?
[00:53:36] <edk> idk it doesn't seem healthy
[00:53:40] <manicennui> With insightful submissions like "What are some things on an individual that you consider to be the best genetics?"
[00:53:53] <gerikson> ``The point of looksmaxxing could be anything- to help you get ahead in society (pretty people get more job opportunities), to help with dating, or to become an e-girl and scam moids out of their money''
[00:54:38] <manicennui> gerikson: Perhaps you should looksmax for your wife.
[00:54:59] <manicennui> Get some hair plugs like Elon.
[00:55:48] <gerikson> she's fine w/ me being bald/shaved
[00:55:53] <gerikson>  I just have to have a beard
[00:56:01] <vladimyr> This whole thing reminded me of this classic https://youtu.be/YRpj5p_9C-0

[01:01:37] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Why does it seem like he is looking above the camera?
[01:01:55] <ngoldbaum> he’s bad at live tv?
[01:03:22] <manicennui> His transformation into Larry David is hilarious on Curb.
[01:09:36] <manicennui> "FDS is no stranger to hate: the community takes a moralizing stance against porn and BDSM, and exhibits transphobia, whorephobia, and fatphobia."
[01:09:39] <manicennui> Wonderful.
[01:10:31] <manicennui> "FDS gives women advice on using men to their personal benefit, much as TRP does for men, but, unlike in the manosphere, this runs alongside strategizing on legitimate, proportional, reality-based concerns around everything from sexual assault to reproductive control."
[01:10:37] <manicennui> I think this is what makes it so odd.
[01:12:55] <manicennui> The mix of crazy with potentially good advice.
[01:13:34] <edk> most crazy things mix crazy with some amount of good advice...
[01:13:44] <manicennui> The Red Pill doesn't seem to.
[01:13:49] <edk> sure they do
[01:14:01] <edk> "look after yourself"
[01:14:14] <manicennui> What is their definition of looking after oneself?
[01:14:36] <gerikson> ``We [Google] expect developers to be able to learn any language they need to, but with Rust I think the jury is out that even experience software engineers can get over the hump in a reasonable timeframe, let alone without writing pretty poor code along the way.''
[01:14:54] <edk> i'm not super up to date but it tends to involve getting fit and healthy
[01:14:55] <gerikson> manicennui: don't date gold diggers?
[01:15:24] <edk> offering some good advice along with all the crazy is often the hook that these groups use to attract new people
[01:16:00] <manicennui> edk: I think it is more commonly advice that sounds good, that is crafted to take advantage of their vulnerabilities.
[01:16:35] <edk> sure, but one way for advice to sound good is for it to actually be good, even if it's not an actual requirement
[01:17:46] <manicennui> gerikson: I would not trust most of my coworkers to write Rust.
[01:18:22] <edk> what languages do google count here?
[01:19:00] <manicennui> My coworkers already write some pretty bad Go.
[01:26:06] <manicennui> "Fortran by default indexes arrays at 1. But, you are not restricted to that, you can specify the index range of any array."
[01:26:08] <manicennui> Interesting.
[01:28:35] <gerikson> yeah, TIL

[01:48:47] <ngoldbaum> in what universe is C++ easier than rust? disagree https://lobste.rs/s/odsliw/sustainability_with_rust#c_ac6zjo

[01:49:14] <buttsbot> Human technology: Text files | Lobsters
[01:49:20] <ngoldbaum> they are both quite complicated, C++ has far far far more footguns
[01:49:46] <kline> i dont think they are saying that, i think they are essentially saying the same thing but in different ways
[01:50:05] <kline> rust might be harder to write, but C++ is going to keep you up and night and push the work into future debug sessions
[01:50:40] <kline> faang probably doesnt care about such debug sessions because hiring programmers is cheap but failing to get new shiney out the door is expensive
[01:50:44] <companion_cube> the instant you introduce threads, imho, is when the gap becomes obvious
[01:51:38] <kline> so even if rust and c++ are hard in different ways, c++ wins because its fast-up-front and also because its the king of the hill and never had to compete with rust in the first place
[01:51:38] <buttsbot> >I told a coworker about lobste.rs, and futilely tried to convince him that it isn't HN for Rust
[01:51:40] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: ever write restructured text? in some ways it’s nicer than latex imo
[01:51:46] <ngoldbaum> the syntax is a tad odd
[01:51:57] <companion_cube> if only they didn't have the ``
[01:52:05] <kline> ngoldbaum, I dont understand how any python programmer decided that 3-space tabs was a good idea
[01:52:06] <kline> fuck em
[01:52:06] <ngoldbaum> latex has a lot of weird corner cases
[01:53:20] <ngoldbaum> also the package ecosystem has a lot of issues with mutual incompatibility and that causes real-world issues if you want to do anything nontrivial
[01:53:35] <ngoldbaum> but it’s the workhorse
[01:53:44] <companion_cube> latex is super weird but has 0 competition
[01:53:52] <companion_cube> at least for its main use case: scientific papers
[01:53:55] <ngoldbaum> and it is nice to write technical documents in, you’re right about that
[01:54:20] <kline> companion_cube, Microsoft Word is used by many academic fields and definitely has a share of the CS market
[01:54:34] <ngoldbaum> the equation editor is sad
[01:54:34] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: newp, latex was my intro to the joys of markup being separate from presentation (unlike word), then I naturally fell into HTML, and MD jut makes writing HTML easier
[01:54:40] <companion_cube> for the CS market I'm honestly horrified
[01:54:43] <companion_cube> but otherwise, sure
[01:54:48] <ngoldbaum> can’t you write latex in the word equation editor now?
[01:54:51] <kline> latex is dominant in some fields, notably CS, but even there its not exclusively latex
[01:55:02] <gerikson> Word rules in publishing, sez Stross
[01:55:15] <companion_cube> I think it's probably dominant in CS, maths, and physics
[01:55:20] <gerikson> the review tools are apparently mwhah
[01:55:23] <companion_cube> but not totally dominant ofc.
[01:55:51] <gerikson> if you publish in MS research
[01:55:55] <gerikson> do you have to use Word
[01:56:02] <gerikson> gonna ask Chisnall
[01:56:14] <kline> gerikson, we use the review tools at lot at work and they are good. when you add sharepoint and outlook as well its a very powerful system (but obviously only works in-house, so a little less useful if you are an editing house that takes manuscripts from external authors)
[01:56:18] <companion_cube> gerikson: that seems… weird
[01:56:27] <companion_cube> I doubt that de Moura publishes in word
[01:56:35] <ngoldbaum> all the american astronomy journals use a custom latex class called aastex
[01:56:37] <gerikson> just guessing
[01:56:43] <companion_cube> ah, well
[01:56:49] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[01:57:41] <gerikson> pretty sure word is a better citizen now
[01:57:47] <gerikson> maybe there are add-ons to include DVI
[01:58:26] <gerikson> apparently most crapto "white papers" were written in Word but published so they look like LaTeX docs

[01:59:20] * ngoldbaum laughs in latex resume

[02:23:46] <manicennui> My fiancée was a flight attendant for a few years and I just asked her and she said she only got paid “door close to door open”. She was also required to spend up to 20 hours a week on-call, at the airport, unpaid.
[02:23:47] <manicennui> JFC
[02:29:04] <kline> its definitely one of these low pay/high status jobs where the lifestyle and benefits supposedly balance the shittiness
[02:29:07] <manicennui> Hanging out at the airport for 20 hours might be the worst part.
[02:29:23] <kline> whether or not it does it up to the employee, and they signal that by taking or leaving jobs
[02:33:19] <manicennui> That's nice in theory.
[02:33:43] <gwozniak> I think I have to make a serious effort at writing something in Rust.  I'm not buying all the "it's too hard" stuff compared to C++
[02:34:11] <manicennui> Also funny how as soon as people do choose not to take jobs, companies get the government involved.
[02:34:17] <gwozniak> First I have unfuck my web server setup, tho
[02:35:24] <kline> manicennui, yeah it doesnt work very much like this in practice, and both sides get additional tools. business tend to have better links to govt, and employees tend to have better links to unions
[02:35:37] <manicennui> Really?
[02:35:46] <manicennui> I know you aren't in the US, but companies have plenty of ways to fuck with unions.
[02:35:52] <manicennui> Very few Americans are unionized here.
[02:36:04] <kline> sounds like a problem american workers should grip
[02:37:20] <gwozniak> It would take something like a large, general strike to make a real dent, I expect
[02:39:56] <epilys> Please unionize.
[02:40:15] <bkero> There is an entire industry of companeis who are consulted to break up the legally sanctioned activity of union organizing
[02:40:16] <epilys> gwozniak, what kind of thing do you want to write?
[02:40:17] <bkero> Just ask Amazon.

[02:49:52] <epilys> companion_cube, the path/metadata is in the schema. I based the schema on the sqlar archive format
[02:50:19] <epilys> it's completely 1-1 of a regular FS structure
[02:50:28] <companion_cube> I have no idea
[02:50:31] <epilys> directory structure *
[02:50:39] <companion_cube> do you expose like a single table, a field of which is the path?
[02:50:48] <epilys> https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html
[02:50:48] <buttsbot> SQLite Archive Files
[02:50:56] <epilys> this page has the schema
[02:51:13] <manicennui> companion_cube: It just looks like a normal filesystem to cd and friends.
[02:51:15] <epilys> 'The filename (the full pathname relative to the root of the archive) is in the "name" field.'
[02:51:18] <companion_cube> now make a virtual table that reads lobste.rs
[02:51:24] <companion_cube> manicennui: I know
[02:51:28] <manicennui> Okay.
[02:51:29] <companion_cube> I'm asking about the sqlite side

[02:51:51] <companion_cube> oh TIL about sqlar
[02:51:53] <epilys> Fork this and query the lobsters api!
[02:51:59] <epilys> it's a template repository

[06:56:00] <imode> monday's markets are going to be deep, blood red.
[06:56:47] <manicennui> Are there any honest reviews online anymore?
[06:57:04] <manicennui> How does one search for non-bullshit product recommendations on Google?
[06:57:16] <manicennui> Everything is lists that are so obviously bullshit affiliate nonsense.
[06:57:26] <manicennui> And never actually the best of anything.
[06:57:49] <manicennui> Their "reviews" are like one line descriptions taken from the product description.
[06:58:57] <manicennui> And how can a "best of" list contain dozens of recommendations?
[06:59:53] <companion_cube> imode: what happened?
[07:00:13] <manicennui> imode is going to power down an AWS data center.
[07:00:17] <companion_cube> :D
[07:00:23] <companion_cube> or maybe, possible war
[07:00:36] <manicennui> I read that it is happening on Wednesday.
[07:01:39] <imode> war, rate hikes, general economic uncertainty.
[07:01:47] <imode> manicennui: I use DDG and reddit.
[07:01:58] <manicennui> Are they any better?
[07:02:16] <manicennui> I guess reddit can be useful depending on the thing I'm looking for.
[07:03:05] <manicennui> But they also tend to reinforce each other's bad opinions.
[07:09:36] <ivan> I use https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ and twitter search and algolia
[07:09:36] <buttsbot> Reddit Search
[07:09:46] <ivan> https://hn.algolia.com/ I mean
[07:09:46] <buttsbot> Just a moment...
[07:10:47] <companion_cube> algolia is really good, tb
[07:10:49] <companion_cube> tbh
[07:13:15] <gwozniak> When searching for reviews, I use DDG and a lot of meta-analysis
[07:13:50] <manicennui> I probably just need to figure out who is an actual authority on the thing.
[07:14:10] <gwozniak> I mostly consider reviews to be poor or straight up junk and try to get a picture from looking at a lot of stuff in various places
[07:14:34] <gwozniak> Search engine stuff helps me find some places, but I really consider it more a research project
[07:14:40] <gwozniak> Otherwise, I just ask someone
[07:16:26] <gwozniak> I mostly avoid any commercial review sites, such as Yelp, TripAdvisor and so forth.  There is rarely anything useful there
[07:46:23] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/7j0xeueapgh81.jpg
[07:56:30] <indigo> gwozniak: agreed. online reviews are the worst
[07:56:50] <indigo> I like real people reviews
[07:59:59] <indigo> Although Erowid drug reviews are fun to read :D

[20:35:30] <prussian> might sound like a dumb question, but why would pinging a machine on my local network be faster over my VPN than pinging it directly?
[20:36:35] <imode> that doesn't sound right. what're your times.

[20:39:20] <prussian> https://clbin.com/Gpf1p <- vpn; https://clbin.com/PLvfs <- not vpn
[20:39:52] <imode> if your VPN understands that that's a local machine, it might just forward it directly to your router.
[20:40:13] <imode> so it'd be down to your router's load at that point.
[20:40:15] <prussian> ya
[20:40:38] <prussian> someone told me it could be simply firewall related since traffic on the VPN interface is allowed
[20:41:03] <prussian> basically just -j ACCEPT for all
[20:41:22] <imode> yeh. chalk it up to the VPN being local-network-aware.
[20:41:36] <imode> strictly local will be faster than the VPN and vice versa depending on router/fw load.

[20:49:05] <buttsbot> Twatter - jrurbanenetwork - So apparently you can buy a TBM on Alibaba, probably due to the volume of subway construction in China. Here is a model...
[20:49:09] <manicennui> These were either actions traditionally associated with women, including recycling and using a reusable shopping bag; actions traditionally associated with men, such as caulking windows and doors and donating to a waterfowl sportsman's group; or gender-neutral actions like paying bills online or turning off the air conditioner.
[20:49:32] <manicennui> MANLY CAULK
[20:49:59] <imode> caulked and ready to raulk.
[20:50:26] <imode> ngoldbaum: elon musk on watch.
[20:50:35] <manicennui> People who engaged in gender-incongruent green behaviors were "rated as less likely to be heterosexual," the researchers write, "suggesting that people were questioning targets' heterosexual identity rather than declaring them to be gay or lesbian."
[20:51:07] <imode> closeted gays want to destroy the earth.
[20:51:17] <imode> duly noted.
[20:51:39] <manicennui> “Will that man recycling a soda can suck my cock?”
[20:52:38] <imode> I don't know how to read that other than "closeted gay" or "insecure fragile masculinity".
[20:52:47] <imode> the latter is probably more accurate.
[20:54:09] <gwozniak> prussian: yes, it seems to work just fine.  There are thousands of DNS requests made on my local network in a short period of time
[20:55:18] <gwozniak> And there are not that many devices here
[20:55:57] <prussian> I'll have to investigate my own local dnsmasq I guess.
[20:56:04] <prussian> or set it up I mean
[20:56:05] <prussian> for that
[20:57:34] <gwozniak> I also found out that my router uses .home for the local network, so I finally have a couple internal hostnames set up
[20:58:58] <prussian> confusing...
[20:59:07] <prussian> i thought mDNS was supposed to be .local
[21:00:20] <prussian> but ya. I like having domain names for local stuff.
[21:01:09] <gwozniak> Yeah, I always thought .local was for that, despite me not really knowing this stuff very well

[21:48:26] <imode> nevermind it's actually decent.
[21:50:07] <cb> riv: i think what people also forgot w/ flash is the tooling
[21:50:16] <cb> was very easy for a non-programmer or dabbler in programmer to start doing stuff
[21:50:21] <cb> i dont think there's equiv tooling for html5
[21:50:55] <drakonis> this guy's got some real rose tinted glasses here
[21:51:10] <imode> it's borderline trolling.
[21:51:38] <drakonis> i don't think flash worked with windows 98 lol
[21:52:02] <drakonis> oh it existed in the 90s
[21:52:03] <drakonis> great.
[21:52:16] <Brekkjern> Back in 95/99 we thought 15 FPS was good.
[21:52:18] <drakonis> but it was never used for anything too exceedingly elaborate and interactive
[21:52:27] <Brekkjern> "Run well" is relative :P
[21:52:37] <manicennui> It did: https://web.archive.org/web/20200525194357/https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html
[21:52:38] <buttsbot> Archived Adobe Flash Player versions
[21:53:03] <drakonis> actionscript was introduced in the early 2000s
[21:53:17] <drakonis> which is where flash would actually flourish
[21:53:52] <manicennui> I even remember some kind of thing in the late 90s to package Flash apps as native apps.
[21:53:54] <riv> yeah flash 4 was what got me started programming
[21:54:14] <riv> you didn't need to know anything because you had a drop down menu with all the language constructs in it
[21:54:16] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR
[21:54:16] <buttsbot> Adobe AIR - Wikipedia
[21:54:18] <riv> so good
[21:54:44] <drakonis> there were a few games made with adobe air
[21:54:45] <manicennui> I thought there was something earlier.
[21:54:49] <drakonis> big indie games
[21:55:06] <drakonis> the first anodyne was written using it
[21:55:17] <drakonis> was released with it, rather.
[21:58:39] <imode> either this dude's computer is from the 90's and he's trying to run firefox on win98, or he's setting up a strawman based on the perception that the game is choppy.
[21:58:59] <imode> the player moves 10px per action and the canvas is scaled. the fuck else do you expect.
[21:59:51] <drakonis> this is all very wrong jfc
[21:59:55] <riv> i think he is right
[22:00:07] <riv> web stuff runs badly in general
[22:00:13] <imode> this particular web stuff runs fine.
[22:00:25] <riv> sometimes it runs well in one browser and bad in another
[22:00:27] <imode> and I'm usually the dude who hates on web shit.
[22:03:10] <riv> maybe he had 50 tabs open :P
[22:03:36] <imode> I have 100 tabs open!
[22:03:51] <imode> 117 to be precise.
[22:03:54] <prussian> Not enough tabs
[22:03:56] <manicennui> Almost anything could change its performance, including OS, browser/browser version, etc.
[22:04:01] <imode> it's a weekend, prussian. :P
[22:04:04] <prussian> You must construct additional tabs
[22:04:12] <imode> manicennui: I have my doubts about that. extreme doubts.
[22:04:48] <imode> this isn't something that could have variable performance cross-platform unless you've pegged all your cores with something taxing.
[22:05:10] <imode> I wanna see a counterexample of that.
[22:06:42] <manicennui> This game is way too hard.
[22:06:56] <imode> also anybody who uses 'serious business' these days needs to be beaten upside the head with a brick.
[22:07:12] <manicennui> Oh, I was playing it incorrectly I think.
[22:07:21] <gwozniak> I remember Flash being annoying because of the animations and popping up in places you didn't want it.  But there were many places it ran just fine, especially little games
[22:07:34] <imode> yeah, ones that use simpler graphics.
[22:07:37] <manicennui> I thought you had to hit the falling things.
[22:07:47] <imode> nah it's just space invaders.
[22:07:48] <companion_cube> I remember playing "N" a lot
[22:07:57] <manicennui> The main problems with Flash were people using it unnecessarily for basic web shit, and security problems.
[22:08:01] <prussian> I'm too delusional to remember how good or bad it was back theb
[22:08:03] <gwozniak> Adobe AIR was woefully underperformant for large tasks
[22:08:14] <ngoldbaum> flash’e authoring tools were dead simple
[22:08:17] <prussian> But ya, I remember playing flash games too.
[22:08:25] <ngoldbaum> there’s a reason so many 12 year olds were obsessed with flash
[22:08:36] <manicennui> I came across a website about a week ago that required flash and wanted me to install as special browser with flash. I posted that here.
[22:08:41] <manicennui> Forget what the browser was.
[22:08:53] <manicennui> There was absolutely no reason for that site to require flash.
[22:08:59] <manicennui> It was just some company website.
[22:09:27] <manicennui> We seem to shun all tools that are easy to use for average people.
[22:09:28] <imode> and now it's all broken lmao.
[22:09:56] <gwozniak> I think that comment linked above is not all that inaccurate
[22:10:10] <manicennui> Hypercard is gone, Flash is gone. Delphi and VB exist, but aren't considered something you'd use for a new project.
[22:10:28] <gwozniak> With respect to Flash stuff, at least
[22:10:37] <manicennui> Oh, Frontpage is gone.
[22:11:06] <manicennui> It seems like these tools are poo pooed by software engineers even though they aren't really made for them.
[22:11:12] <manicennui> And we are left with nothing.
[22:11:25] <imode> flash stuff that didn't do anything taxing ran well.
[22:11:33] <manicennui> Although I'd much rather use Delphi or VB with a different language to write desktop apps.
[22:11:39] <manicennui> I don't want to use fucking electron.
[22:12:01] <imode> use freepascal or lazarus.
[22:12:02] <manicennui> I might mess around with JavaFX and use Clojure.
[22:12:38] <prussian> Just have a web app that opens up the user's web browser.
[22:12:40] <prussian> Simple
[22:12:40] <imode> isn't that already outdated.
[22:12:48] <imode> JavaFX rather.
[22:13:01] <manicennui> prussian: Until you want non-software engineers to run it and don't want to host it anywhere.
[22:13:01] <imode> I can't tell what you're "supposed to use" for a UI in Java land.
[22:13:34] <prussian> I don't think anyone can
[22:13:44] <imode> this is why GTK is still around. :\
[22:13:48] <manicennui> I'm thinking about writing some tools for our stuff at work, and I want something that a user can just download and run, then change the config to point at whatever instance of our app they want.
[22:14:11] <manicennui> imode: Fortunately I don't care whether it is the latest and greatest.
[22:14:23] <manicennui> I'm not convinced that anyone does who is trying to do actual work.
[22:14:32] <imode> I don't even care about latest and greatest, I care about deprecated and current.
[22:14:46] <manicennui> We have an old crufty admin/call center UI that just won't die because almost everyone prefers it.
[22:15:09] <manicennui> imode: JavaFX is up to date.
[22:15:14] <manicennui> Updated in the latest JDK.
[22:15:17] <prussian> JavaFX I believe use to ship with the JVMs, but I think it was split off as optional
[22:15:31] <imode> I see.
[22:15:42] <imode> well that's an improvement, I guess.

[22:16:02] <manicennui> If that convinces you.
[22:16:20] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: do you clients write elevator firmware? :p ^
[22:16:37] <companion_cube> isn't there a reactive clojure frontend to javaFX?
[22:16:53] <manicennui> I think writing an algorithm for elevator operation would be a cool exercise.
[22:16:56] <imode> I seem to remember something calling JavaFX "on the deprecation path".
[22:16:57] <manicennui> Not the actual firmware.
[22:17:07] <manicennui> Just "these buttons have been pressed, where you do go?"
[22:17:10] <imode> where the hell did I read that..
[22:17:44] <manicennui> imode: I think Oracle discontinued support.
[22:17:50] <manicennui> But who cares about Oracle support?
[22:17:52] <imode> fair.
[22:18:02] <prussian> Can anything in Java ever truly be deprecated?
[22:18:03] <manicennui> "Starting with JDK 11, Oracle will remove JavaFX from the JDK, though will continue to provide commercial support for it in Oracle JDK 8 at least until 2022, according to Oracle’s blog. The technology, which is used to write cross platform, rich-client applications, will become available as a separate download."
[22:18:14] <prussian> I bet there are people still using openjdk 8
[22:18:22] <imode> my brain probably autocompleted that to deprecated at some point.
[22:18:34] <manicennui> prussian: Absolutely.
[22:18:44] <manicennui> I think 8 is a common version to be stuck at.
[22:19:20] <manicennui> I don't follow JDK development very closely, but it seems like all kinds of things have changed in the last few years with Oracle.
[22:19:34] <manicennui> And a lot of things announced a few years ago are not exactly right anymore.
[22:19:55] <manicennui> I know there was a period when people were questioning whether openjdk should even be used in prod, and now it seems to be the default.
[22:20:12] <manicennui> Because Oracle included certain things only in their distro.
[22:20:28] <manicennui> I still have no idea why in the world Oracle bought Sun.

[22:20:36] <buttsbot> Elevator Saga - the elevator programming game
[22:20:39] <prussian> I never understood the whole jvm crazy
[22:20:52] <manicennui> prussian: The what?
[22:20:55] <prussian> 99% of the time I'd just pick openjdk and it just worked...
[22:21:03] <manicennui> imode: Nice.
[22:21:09] <prussian> No licensing... no nothing.
[22:21:17] <manicennui> prussian: The differences weren't as significant as people made them out to be.
[22:21:26] <imode> I never understood what the differences were.
[22:21:40] <manicennui> I knew what they were at one point because I looked into it.
[22:21:47] <manicennui> They were not things that most people even cared about.
[22:21:56] <prussian> I haven't done any Java in 5 years so idk shit.
[22:21:58] <manicennui> But most people seemed to just use Oracle's JDK.
[22:22:32] <imode> I do Java every day and I don't know shit either.
[22:22:35] <manicennui> Fortunately Oracle seems to be mostly just letting the open source stuff continue.
[22:22:57] <manicennui> I think they figured out that they aren't going to be able to sue everyone and make a bunch of money from it.
[22:23:16] <manicennui> Hopefully in another decade we will reminisce about the time when Oracle owned Java.
[22:23:38] <imode> just like that time when microsoft owned C#?
[22:23:41] <imode> ;)
[22:23:53] <manicennui> MS seems much more involved in C#/mono.
[22:24:19] <manicennui> There are still a lot of Oracle people involved in OpenJDK development, but they seem to be more hands off as an org.
[22:24:49] <prussian> I thought Oracle's latest hail mary was in Graal
[22:25:54] <ngoldbaum> ms hired the main mono maintainers didn’t they?
[22:26:52] <ngoldbaum> miguel de icaza
[22:33:24] <manicennui> In August 2012, de Icaza criticized the Linux desktop as "killed by Apple". De Icaza specifically criticized a generally developer-focused culture, lack of backward compatibility and fragmentation among the various Linux distributions.[21][22] In March 2013, de Icaza announced on his personal blog that he regularly used macOS instead of Linux for desktop computing.[23]
