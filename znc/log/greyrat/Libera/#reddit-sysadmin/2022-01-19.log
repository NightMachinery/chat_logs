[01:11:57] <PublicWifi> ?
[01:12:04] <xe0n> its required when you use aadc, if you dont plan on syncing objects, use something like migwiz to do a cutover migration
[01:12:08] <xe0n> then its not required.
[01:12:28] <DrZak> like, chopping off cpus and memory
[01:13:07] <xe0n> you can, as long as its a supported config, i.e. if exchange services can't start, well..

[01:13:16] <xe0n> what
[01:13:23] <PublicWifi> our exchange box is fucked
[01:13:32] <xe0n> then you'd build a new exchange box now

[04:04:44] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Idk if want a cabinet instead tho
[04:04:48] <DrGibby> honestly, little new crown moulding, remount the slides with new hardware, and I bet it'll be like new
[04:04:58] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> There are no slides
[04:05:06] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> So I’d need smaller drawers
[04:05:21] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I could do that too but it’s kinda shitty tbh inside
[04:05:24] <DrGibby> which wouldn't be too difficult 
[04:05:32] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> So I might rebuild the whole thing
[04:05:52] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> It’s got like old ass slats above. Not framed in completely
[04:06:08] <DrGibby> thats about as straightforward as a build can get tbh
[04:06:12] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> So top drawer is like sketch looking when u look inside
[04:06:23] <DrGibby> most of the bottom rail ones are
[04:06:47] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I guess a bottom rail might fit on it
[04:07:11] <DrGibby> I'd be curious to see how much room exists between the drawer and the wall tbh
[04:07:24] <DrGibby> NEEDS MORE PICS
[04:07:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> The drawers literally just slide inside the box there is no room on the sides
[04:07:36] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> So they slide like shit
[04:08:17] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And I think the house having shifted over time makes it look wonky
[04:08:38] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I’ll have to check how square I could make it
[04:09:07] <DrGibby> I mean, if I were doing it, I'd demo it, get the box inside all nice, determine the layout of the drawers, build the faces and spaces, mount the side rails, then the face frames and call it a day
[04:09:19] <DrGibby> prob two-weekender
[04:09:41] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Was considering reusing the faces
[04:09:48] <AdmiralNines> man thats' a lot of work
[04:09:49] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And rebuild the rest
[04:09:56] <DrGibby> I'd also stain it instead of painting, but thats my preference 
[04:10:05] <DrGibby> oh, you absolutely should! 
[04:10:21] <DrGibby> new pull hardware too heh
[04:10:28] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I kinda like it tho
[04:10:35] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> It’s a 1904 house
[04:10:46] <DrGibby> ur a 1904 house 
[04:10:46] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Trying to keep it classic as possible
[04:10:55] <DrGibby> sure, emulate the style for sure
[04:11:19] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Maybe I could find other Victorian hardware tho
[04:11:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Like at some antique store
[04:11:43] <DrGibby> shit, Lowes likely has something in that style
[04:11:59] <DrGibby> aks ekaj, he's like majority stock holder there
[04:12:06] <DrGibby> s/aks/ask
[04:12:08] <layer8> DrGibby meant: "ask ekaj, he's like majority stock holder there"
[04:12:48] <DrGibby> tbh, NinjaStyle, I'd start by drawing it up, seeing what can be reused etc
[04:13:20] <DrGibby> see how the drawer faces are attached, etc
[04:13:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah. I think I’ll just keep it in the same configuration but just rebuild the box and drawers. That’s probably easiest
[04:13:53] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> That way I can mount rails
[04:14:04] <Cl0udNinja> existential thought: is gravity pushing on my shoulders, or pulling on my feet
[04:14:10] <DrGibby> and, if you've never done dovetails, you can try on these! 
[04:14:19] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah true.
[04:14:20] <DrGibby> because dovetails are beautiful 
[04:14:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> That’d be fun
[04:15:06] <DrGibby> just remember to let the drawer bottom float in the box :) 
[04:15:23] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Lol like when I mount the slides?
[04:15:51] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Good call I’ll probably end up doing something idiotic
[04:16:14] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Maybe I can shim it square
[04:16:15] <DrGibby> well, depending on the drawer size, the bottom may need to "float" inside the cuts along the bottom of the drawer 
[04:16:29] <DrGibby> the bottom of each drawer, that is
[04:16:38] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Oh I see what u mean. Like if I route out the slots
[04:16:52] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Which I probably will
[04:17:13] <DrGibby> you can route them, however I would dato them
[04:17:24] <DrGibby> s/dato/dado
[04:17:24] <layer8> DrGibby meant: "you can route them, however I would dado them"
[04:17:46] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> What’s that
[04:18:07] <DrGibby> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sea5Euxa-7Q
[04:18:19] <DrGibby> basically, a saw blade that makes a super wide cut
[04:18:29] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Oh like on a table saw or something?
[04:18:31] <DrGibby> or, in other words, the kerf is massive 
[04:18:32] <DrGibby> yeah
[04:18:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> My ex wife’s parents kept my table saw and my miter saw
[04:18:52] <Kiernian> I don't route the packets on my VM's management vlan, I dado them. #MTUSize

[04:19:36] <DrGibby> dado is bae tbh
[04:20:26] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah that makes sense
[04:21:54] <DrGibby> and, you can get dado blades that range from a little over your standard kerf, all the way up to 1" I think
[04:22:05] <DrGibby> like, adjustable blades 
[04:27:05] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Oh tight
[04:27:10] <xe0n> tight like a tiger
[04:27:20] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah I really just hate that I need to rebuy tools

[04:28:53] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Lol
[04:29:54] <xe0n> i had a set of hole drill bits, used them like once, mate borrowed them, i'm still waiting for them back...that was like 4 years ago!
[04:30:50] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah I moved into a condo a while back and gave all my bigger tools to my wife’s parents to use as they needed basically till I wanted them back
[04:31:02] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> They kept a few and broke my compressor
[04:31:34] <AdmiralNines> that's whaat you get for buying your own tools. You should be borrowing them from the neighbor.
[04:31:39] <xe0n> god damn, hook up the nail gun and start firi...oh wait...compressor broken :(
[04:31:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> That requires me talking to my neighbor
[04:32:11] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I tried to blow out my sprinklers and had no pressure at the outlet

[04:32:46] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> The pressure regulator was like basically in 100 pieces once I removed it
[04:32:49] <xe0n> is a condo a fancy name for a duplex?
[04:33:03] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> No it’s like an apartment you purchase
[04:33:24] <xe0n> and then spend a few years renovating?
[04:33:53] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I mean. You just get 1 unit in a large building
[04:34:03] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Idk what u mean.
[04:34:20] <xe0n> the word condo isnt used much in aus, if ever lol
[04:34:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> But since it had no private garage I didn’t have space for my tools
[04:34:27] <xe0n> so im trying to picture what it is
[04:34:46] <xe0n> so its a unit nice
[04:34:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Just imagine an apartment building with nicer finishes and stuff
[04:34:55] <xe0n> ah
[04:34:59] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> And each unit is purchased
[04:35:02] <xe0n> yup
[04:36:10] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> A duplex would be like a split single building with one person on each side, townhome is similar but often more units than 2. That’s the nomenclature I know
[04:36:36] <AdmiralNines> and after you've paid for the actual unit and you now supposedly own that space, you pay condo dues instead of rent.
[04:36:41] <xe0n> im in a townhome
[04:36:56] <xe0n> yeah body corp here
[04:37:24] <AdmiralNines> oh, also you can't do anything special with it unless you get it approved by the condo board
[04:37:31] <xe0n> yup
[04:37:35] <xe0n> sounds like body corporate here
[04:37:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah my HOA dues in the condo were 700/mo. Condo HOA is always outrageous but you get access to the gym and garage and shit and they handle any building wide issues
[04:38:05] <AdmiralNines> true. and they make sure you don't do anything fun with your place. or that anyone else does either.
[04:38:28] <AdmiralNines> Yes, please let me pay you 700/mo to tell me what to do with stuff i supposedly own.
[04:38:43] <xe0n> dont they do like land maintenance around the block?
[04:38:50] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah. They are sticklers. They don’t really care what you do inside the unit as far as I noticed but they are kinda dicks.

[11:57:21] <SirSceptalot> it's not a lack of work - I haven't been open for other opportunities
[11:57:51] <SirSceptalot> I have kind of a good thing here. I'm "the IT guy" and decide my own work mostly
[11:58:36] <SirSceptalot> there's also a couple of benefits that might not be very common
[11:58:51] <SirSceptalot> I actually have 2 company vehicles, one of which is a motorcycle
[11:59:38] <SirSceptalot> I can invoice anything that might remotely be justifiable as a company purchase on the company so I can get it without VAT
[12:00:17] <SirSceptalot> if I need any company assets/hardware (such as a van or truck or whatever) I can just use it, no questions
[12:00:54] <SirSceptalot> a lot of trust is what I'm saying I guess?
[12:01:50] <SirSceptalot> on the other hand, I might be able to make more money elsewhere, but I have no idea how to quantify my skillset/abilities
[12:02:26] <SirSceptalot> quitting this job would probably need to be a leap of faith for me. I'm not worried about being out of a job, there's always work for people that want to work

[12:30:05] <SirSceptalot> I guess if you want to be technical about it, as soon as you pronounce it and it has a meaning, it's a word, right?

[12:30:38] <Cl0udNinja> no..
[12:30:46] <Cl0udNinja> I'm pretty sure thats how it works
[12:30:49] <JollyRgrs> if we're talking about actually defined words by some society (meriam-webster, etc.) then it must be accepted by that governing body
[12:30:58] <Cl0udNinja> what do they know?

[12:31:12] <JollyRgrs> no denying that
[12:31:29] <JollyRgrs> but generally a bunch of nerds talking together... there's ppl who know
[12:31:36] <Cl0udNinja> also with the rise of meme popularity, you can easily get them to add a word by making it popular
[12:31:49] <JollyRgrs> well, by definition, they add words that are... popular
[12:31:51] <SirSceptalot> sadly
[12:32:02] <SirSceptalot> I'm still angry that "hating on" is an accepted term
[12:32:07] <JollyRgrs> when a word becomes popular enough, that's normally when it is added to the dictionary
[12:32:12] <JollyRgrs> like the verb "googling"
[12:32:14] <SirSceptalot> you can't "hate on" anything, you can only "hate" something
[12:32:16] <Cl0udNinja> but what is it before then?
[12:32:33] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: not true
[12:32:33] <Cl0udNinja> if its not a word, but its got meaning, and usage, pronunciation, isnt it a word? even if the nerds dont say it is
[12:32:56] <JollyRgrs> i can "not hate" dem hos while at the same time, I can be "hatin' on" dem hos

[14:55:40] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Can it just be, "yup returned 200" or should it be more
[14:56:20] <riff-IRC> Ask a classroom full of high schoolers to test it.
[14:57:25] <estranger> a lot more
[14:57:41] <estranger> should be a full qa test
[14:58:01] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> haha like we even have any automated testing
[14:58:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> *cries*
[14:58:30] <estranger> well..... heh
[14:58:40] <riff-IRC> When we ran a certification run on a generator control system, we simulated EVERY possible operating condition that the system was likely to encounter, plus quite a few failure scenarios.
[14:58:56] <estranger> also depends what kind of website... any backend logic needs more than a 200 test
[14:59:30] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> To be more specific it's a CMS so the vendor is testing (hopefully) stuff on their end
[14:59:46] <estranger> and why is raid 0 running on a non distributed system
[15:00:31] <riff-IRC> Because that's how they set it up.
[15:00:52] <riff-IRC> We got them up and running and reconfigured it to a RAID 1.
[15:00:58] <estranger> I'm a vendor, we qa the shit out of our software, but suggest clients smoke test everything heavy on an upgrade, or application update
[15:01:27] <signofzeta> Same with any QA testing.  Use the web site to order 1 item, order 99999 items, order -1.69 items, order a duck, order 2hfuiwerfiuwoi items, order ;DROP TABLE 'users' items.
[15:01:50] <estranger> signofzeta yup

[15:02:28] <estranger> one of my major bank customers have an app that processes text messages you send them...
[15:02:36] <riff-IRC> (that's the 64-bit integer limit + 1)
[15:02:40] <estranger> like bal to check balance etc
[15:02:55] * riff-IRC nods
[15:03:14] <estranger> someone sent in "bal 🙏" and their app didn't know how to handle emojis
[15:03:28] <estranger> crashed their whole text processing infrastructure :D
[15:03:30] <riff-IRC> so it crashed the backend?
[15:03:35] <riff-IRC> heh

[15:03:48] <signofzeta> "UTF-8, motherfucker!  Do you speak it?"
[15:03:49] <riff-IRC> step 1: discard non-ASCII characters
[15:03:59] <estranger> yeah that's what I said
[15:04:20] <riff-IRC> step 2: escape the escape sequences
[15:04:35] <estranger> they wanted to know if we could filter it out.... no, we pass on the bytes.. write your app right

[18:00:41] <PattyCakes> hopefully it goes legal before the next poor fucker had to do drywall work in this house
[18:00:51] <Disconnect> We put a note in the wall (and signed the back of the drywall) after we gutted and rebuilt the kitchen. Down to the studs. We're not particularly handy. It was fun but never ever ever ever again.
[18:00:54] <PattyCakes> hopefully I'm not that next poor fucker
[18:01:09] <PattyCakes> yea, you gotta enjoy the chaos Disconnect 
[18:01:12] <Lancehead_> put a tiny speaker in the bedroom that you can send stuff through wirelessly, give someone schizophrenia by making them think they're hallucinating
[18:01:17] <PattyCakes> I've lived in an active renovation for a few years now
[18:01:23] <PattyCakes> It's slowly making me go bonkers
[18:01:28] <PattyCakes> well more bonkers than I started with
[18:01:36] <fritzwastaken> PublicWifi has a fat ass
[18:01:53] <Lancehead_> you'll never be as bonkers as fritzwastaken, at least
[18:01:55] <Lancehead_> or me 
[18:01:56] <Disconnect> Pulled down 40 layers of crap (paint, fake paneling, "cardboard" drywall, etc) and found a newspaper patch from the 60s (shortly after construction) made out of a Macy's Mink coat advertisement.

[18:03:03] <PattyCakes> you never know what's behind a wall - and 9 times out of 10 a surprise == thousands of dollars
[18:03:38] <Disconnect> This place was built by Levitt as one of his last "white christian" suburbs in the 60s. And then the first owner was kinda time-life-books style handy so that was .. ok. Some nice shelves and stuff. Some total WTF. As usual.
[18:03:40] <PattyCakes> found out when someone added an electrical switch for the fan in the spare bedroom?
[18:03:45] <PattyCakes> yea they used an extension cord
[18:03:48] <PattyCakes> to connect the switch
[18:03:56] <PattyCakes> a legit jacketed consumer extension cord

[18:04:40] <Disconnect> The second owner though... that dude was NOT handy. And he had rage issues (badly patched holes.) And he had half-ass issues. They opened the MBR to the next room and then put a "phone booth" closet just sticking out of the corner of this large rectangular room.. they stuccoed EVERYTHING  they touched (drywall is hard yo) but not with stucco. Just with PLASTER. RAW PLASTER.

[18:08:02] <PattyCakes> you know what I mean though LOL
[18:08:11] <Lancehead_> Americans will use everything but normal measurements 
[18:08:11] <Disconnect> We lost an outside light that way. It goes from the box to one downstairs room, to one plug in the bedroom above, to the stairway light, to an outlet in the MBR (expanded side) to the outloet by hte fireplace downstairs, to the light. At the fireplace side it is too short to splice.
[18:08:21] <Lancehead_> "ya err this here piece a wood is about 15 boys' tennis shoes long" 
[18:08:48] <PattyCakes> I mean, it's the same over yonder in your neck of the woods Lancehead_ 
[18:08:56] <PattyCakes> whatever 2x4 is in cm - works out to not actually measuring that size

[18:09:17] <Lancehead_> i just say "wood thingy" so i'm correct
[18:09:43] <PattyCakes> also, 100% with using metric
[18:09:52] <PattyCakes> shame is, once you learn imperial and fractions? I find it easier
[18:10:06] <PattyCakes> math is hard and PattyCakes is stupid
[18:10:18] <Lancehead_> 9+10=21
[18:10:25] <PattyCakes> sounds right
[18:10:38] <PattyCakes> might be off by 1
[18:10:43] <PattyCakes> could be 121

[23:18:08] <spstarr> \o/
[23:18:10] <sd> 14<K​illnine> wow
[23:18:17] <int0x1C8> why?
[23:18:32] <epony> Sun is no more either.
[23:19:00] <sintax> the sun will be back tomorrow
[23:19:14] <epony> AIX is getting replaced by Linux, and so is HPUX.. (it's been BSD UNIX from AT&T derivative)
[23:20:06] <epony> Sunmicro was a failing workstation speculative vendor and server bundle VAR with CPU offshore productions with Fujitsu/NEC
[23:20:51] <epony> overgrown and failing exit of the WS market that collapsed in the 1990-1994 period
[23:21:11] <epony> held that 1995-2005 for no good reason (and was closed)
[23:21:42] <epony> and was a much more successful speculant than Apple, which is v2 of the same failure
[23:21:46] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I don't think it's fair to call them a VAR when basically no one makes their own silicon, even back then.
[23:22:11] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But I realize now you're just trolling so carry on
[23:22:18] <vinrock> is fujitsu siemens still in the windows box biz?
[23:22:26] <epony> except Intel and some other microprocessor vendors and specialised IC foundries
[23:23:39] <epony> actually everyone was making their own for the supporting chips and just the microprocessors were outsourced gradually in the 1980-1990 de-industrialisation period
[23:23:43] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Also SPARC64 came out in 1995
[23:24:19] <epony> does not mean Sunmicro designed the chip ;-)
[23:24:35] <epony> and did not make the computers
[23:24:39] <epony> so, is just a VAR
[23:25:01] <epony> with software bundle, like MSFT, AAPL and GOOG (and AMZN and ORACL) these days
[23:26:26] <epony> unbundling of the HW & FW & SW is inevitable on mobile and handheld and embedded too
[23:27:05] <epony> it's just leasing financial and consumer and communications services markets that prevent that from happening
[23:27:32] <epony> these did not exist on the mini- and micro- computers
[23:28:16] <epony> and is the attempt of the above VARs to attempt introduce them and bundle HW & FW & SW like on mobile, you have every reason to despise companies like that ;-)

[23:28:51] <Bru^> anyone ever do a bulk AAD Connect sync removal in their M365 tenant?
