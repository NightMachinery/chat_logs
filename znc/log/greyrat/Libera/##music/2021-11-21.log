[03:51:38] <artao> that's how it happens morlog
[03:51:50] <artao> next thing you know, they're getting married and having little baby scooters
[03:52:37] <Panther> my bike has problems :(
[03:52:54] <Panther> The main one is that I own it.
[03:53:13] <Panther> The front axle brarings are loose.. they may be able to be repacked, or I need a new wheel. Also, the headset is loose, and the bottom bracket needs tightening.
[03:53:55] <morlog> bicycle
[03:53:57] <morlog> ?
[03:54:02] <Panther> ja
[03:54:17] <artao> ouch
[03:54:19] <artao> bearings
[03:54:27] <artao> i too have bearing problems. on my fan
[03:54:30] <morlog> there are some nuts on the front axle that you can adjust to tighten it up
[03:54:38] <artao> hopefully i can disassemble it far enuf to get at the bearings.
[03:54:40] <morlog> same with the headset
[03:54:50] <artao> but then, it HAS been running continuously for like 8 yrs
[03:54:56] <morlog> not sure about your bottom bracket, depends on what kind it is
[03:55:04] <artao> i need a new bottom bracket too. badly
[03:55:08] <artao> on my bike. not my fan
[03:55:15] <Panther> It is the single kind that you push through
[03:55:18] <morlog> you need a special tool to replace them
[03:55:28] <morlog> all one piece?
[03:55:49] <morlog> thats a cartridge bracket, if its loose get a new one
[03:56:01] <artao> part of the reason i actually got out of bed is cuzmy fan was/is squeaking so bad
[03:56:01] <Panther> Very strong, Yep, with an extra little attachment to the chainring on the right side :)
[03:56:02] <artao> lol
[03:56:26] <Panther> They don't make new ones.
[03:56:34] <artao> bottom bracket wrenches are pretty cheap
[03:56:38] <morlog> youd be surprised
[03:57:22] <Panther> Usually I get annoyed and not surprised. :)
[03:57:36] <morlog> they still make bottome brackets for pretty musch anything going all the way back to the late 1800's
[03:57:51] <Panther> 'they'?
[03:58:00] <morlog> manufacturers
[03:58:05] <LibertyDillo> The Communist Chinese
[03:58:09] <LibertyDillo> lol
[03:58:11] <morlog> shimano
[03:58:17] <Panther> I ned my phone.
[03:58:18] <morlog> campiniolo
[03:58:34] <Panther> My shifters are a brand of Shimano .. Falcon.
[03:58:48] <morlog> if its shimano then they still make the parts
[03:59:01] <Panther> I don't nbeed those parts.
[03:59:10] <LibertyDillo> going to be interesting getting into war over Taiwan when the PRC makes most everything we buy at Walmart
[03:59:37] <macrobat> I imagine it's slightly harder to get campagnolo parts
[03:59:44] <Panther> I am going to personally row a boat over to China if there is any more of this Taiwan shit.

[04:00:30] <morlog> campagnolo parts are whats commonly used on high en road bikes and easy to find
[04:01:17] <morlog> dont know how many bikes ive pulled out of dumpsters and trash piles and fixed up
[04:01:17] <artao> damn them!!
[04:01:29] <artao> ikr
[04:01:35] <artao> it's saddening what people throw out :(
[04:01:42] <artao> i got one of my telescopes from the garbage
[04:01:47] <macrobat> saw an ad for a bike with "microshift" parts. idk
[04:01:47] <artao> it just needed some TLC
[04:01:59] <morlog> microshit
[04:02:46] <morlog> i have a recumbent that they stopped making 20 years ago and can still get parts for it from any bike shop
[04:03:02] <macrobat> maybe it costs more to replace the drivetrain on a bad bike than to get a bike in acceptable condition
[04:03:35] <morlog> 2$20 to $50 for a new bottom bracket, $20 for the tools
[04:04:20] <morlog> its best to get a new crankset when you replace the bottom bracket but you dont really need to
[04:05:10] <artao> THOSE can be pricey
[04:05:22] <artao> for a good one
[04:05:28] <artao> crappy bendy ones are cheap
[04:05:32] <morlog> if you go for a casete type they can get pricy
[04:05:53] <morlog> if you go for one with a fixed gearset they are pretty cheap
[04:05:54] <macrobat> I should buy an mtb crankset to replace the one with stripped thread where the right pedal goes
[04:06:07] <artao> ouch
[04:06:17] <artao> i'd love new crank arms, but can't really justify it
[04:06:26] <artao> kinda need new pedals, but these DO still work
[04:06:35] <artao> get some Shin Burgers
[04:06:47] <macrobat> I guess the pedal thread was bad and I didn't notice
[04:07:10] <artao> it's all too easy to cross thread them too
[04:07:14] <morlog> my recumbent is in pretty good shape despite sitting long enough for the tires to rot off completely
[04:07:24] <macrobat> metal. "naglfar" is the mythological ship made out of nails https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSNWiO5OYZU

[04:08:19] <Panther> I wans some new pedals with nice teeth.
[04:08:48] <macrobat> but teef eat my sole :(
[04:09:00] <morlog> i want a life sized blow up doll to ride around with on my scooter
[04:09:00] <Panther> I don't want to have to get toe clips or straps.
[04:09:36] <morlog> ive never needed those
[04:09:57] <macrobat> clipless ftw, but I don't want that for a regular bike
[04:10:07] <Panther> Do suicide bomber dolls blow themselves up?
[04:10:19] <morlog> some sex dolls do
[04:11:04] <macrobat> accidentally the thread where the rear derailleur goes. it's not regular metric thread, but finer
[04:12:27] <morlog> it is metric, just has a finer pitch than a machine screw
[04:13:41] <macrobat> maybe if I drill the outermost turns out
[04:14:08] <morlog> get a tap and tap to the next size up
[04:14:18] <morlog> if your going to do that
[04:15:06] <Panther> And then you can tap a keg.
[04:15:17] <macrobat> need to get the derailler in there too
[04:15:33] <macrobat> drill it all out and weld :D
[04:15:47] <macrobat> I don't have welding equipment

[22:28:03] <Prints> he got spooked because some other people were on the corner of the sidewalk we were on
[22:28:07] <murthy> nativetexan: idk, I see a lot of videos where people stop the entire traffic to save animals.
[22:28:25] <nativetexan> yep, Prints got a taste of that yesterday murq
[22:28:27] <nativetexan> murthy
[22:28:39] <Prints> yea it was terrifying.. i keep getting flashbacks
[22:28:44] <Prints> of him in the middle of the street
[22:28:57] <Prints> if everything didnt happen exactly as it did, he would have gotten killed
[22:29:02] <murthy> Prints: I guess your dog needs training. Also how old is your dog?
[22:29:20] <Prints> just thinking about it is crazy.. like how close the dog got to getting hit
[22:29:29] <Prints> idk, he was a rescue
[22:29:34] <Prints> im guessing 4-5
[22:30:10] <murthy> In Cali 99% chance of survival for dogs. In India 1% chance of survival
[22:30:35] <murthy> Here no open brakes to save lives, dogs or humans
