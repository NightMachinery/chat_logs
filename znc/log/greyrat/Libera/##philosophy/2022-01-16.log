[00:00:00] <causative_> anyway, it doesn't get at the heart of the problem of defining things like the oceans or your liver
[00:00:23] <mycroftiv> to me this is a standard way of speaking in philosophy and math about how sets and spatial objecects work
[00:00:53] <mycroftiv> the idea that any spatial object contains its spatial subregions as sets is mathematicall accurate and i think very standard way to talk. i understand you disagree.
[00:01:04] <causative_> to me, I think it's sloppy to just use set terminology on physical objects without being mathematically much clearer about it
[00:01:40] <causative_> and I think that appropriate and useful terminology for physical objects should model them as something different from just a set of particles-with-positions-and-times
[00:02:13] <causative_> because we want to talk about properties of the object that track it over time
[00:02:14] <mycroftiv> i appreciate that feedback, i think 'the set of fingers attached to my body at 10 pm' is a well defined set object and a way of speaking i thought was actually conventional, but ill perhaps reconsider some ways to talk about things
[00:02:24] <causative_> the ocean should be defined using a state machine - it has inputs and changes its state based on those inputs, and produces outputs back into the world
[00:02:31] <causative_> fundamentally systems are state machines
[00:02:49] <mycroftiv> i do computer programming and thats more or less always been my mental model
[00:02:51] <causative_> and the big trick, the problem of defining systems, is how we can relate the system's state machine to the universe's state machine
[00:02:56] <causative_> and it's obviously not subsethood
[00:03:04] <mycroftiv> inputs and outputs between system and environment
[00:03:11] <causative_> state machines are tuples, one state machine is not going to be a subset of another
[00:03:31] <mycroftiv> objects have multiple simultaneous mathematical descriptions

[00:04:01] <mycroftiv> something being accurately described as a state machine does not prevent it from being accurately described in a different formal framework as something completely diffrent
[00:05:25] <mycroftiv> we have countless accurate maps of the same territory
[00:06:08] <mycroftiv> so just because i can understand myself as a state machine operating on inputs and producing outputs doesnt mean i cant understand myself as a subset of particles of a larger collection

[00:06:23] <mycroftiv> these are totally consistent views even in a single mathematical framework
[00:08:23] <causative_> well, the state machine is not the same object as the set of particle-position-time tuples
[00:08:45] <causative_> we can say that "the particle-position-time set of my liver is a subset of the particle-position-time set of my whole body" no issue there
[00:08:59] <causative_> but the state machine of your liver is something different from just the particles
[00:09:06] <mycroftiv> i completely agree
[00:09:14] <causative_> it's not structurally the same

[00:09:16] <causative_> there's no isomorphism
[00:09:47] <mycroftiv> also agreed, we can make multiple different mathematical descriptions of the same thing, and they wont all be the same at all
[00:10:27] <causative_> well, in mathematics when we do this we relate them using maps from one to the other
[00:10:39] <causative_> and we may in fact have an isomorphism, and then we'd say that they are the same
[00:11:01] <mycroftiv> categorical isomorphism, yes
[00:11:35] <mycroftiv> i prove these kind of equivalences a lot in univalent type theory, where the bijective-isomorphism notion is how the identity type is defined

[00:14:47] <mycroftiv> looks exceellent\
[00:15:34] <mycroftiv> ok on a quick scan id say i understand and agree with all of this
[00:16:41] <mycroftiv> formalizing turing machines and game of life and other computer-programming concepts as a model for general system-universe interactions is very informative i agree
[00:17:28] <causative_> there are problems with that approach though
[00:17:39] <causative_> it's not as simple as I want
[00:17:42] <mycroftiv> in mapping this kind of view to full reality, there are tricky issues with preferred time foliation because we lack GR-quantum unification also
[00:18:06] <mycroftiv> the universe seems to be very contrary about not having global linear time ticks
[00:18:15] <causative_> yes, that's one of the problems
[00:18:29] <causative_> it might still though
[00:18:40] <causative_> we don't know it doesn't - Stephen Wolfram has a theory in which it does
[00:19:03] <mycroftiv> in practice there is a nice global foliation that we can see in the universe so the observations are consistent with something like that

[00:20:52] <causative_> the big problem with defining systems is tracking it through time
[00:20:58] <causative_> and it runs into challenges about identity
[00:21:14] <causative_> because suppose your system is an amoeba, and the amoeba splits - which half is the system continuing on?
[00:21:37] <causative_> the only reasonable approach is to say both halves are viable continuations of the original amoeba
[00:21:49] <mycroftiv> you could flip a coin also
[00:22:21] <causative_> I don't take probability as fundamental to anything - probability is what our brains do to make sense of the mathematical object we find ourselves inside
[00:22:34] <causative_> probability is about an individual agent's lack of knowledge about something
[00:22:41] <mycroftiv> entropy is uncertainty mathematically, yes
[00:22:42] <causative_> it's not about the external universe
[00:22:53] <mycroftiv> but we have good reason to believe the universe is inherently random in this sense
[00:22:59] <mycroftiv> inherently unpredictable
[00:23:09] <causative_> see, "unpredictable" is still in reference to an agent
[00:23:15] <causative_> it's saying "there's no agent that can predict this event"
[00:23:18] <mycroftiv> its still very real
[00:23:20] <causative_> it's not about the universe itself
[00:23:26] <causative_> it's about the agent's ability to predict
[00:23:33] <mycroftiv> that is as objective as anything
[00:23:38] <mycroftiv> all our science is about our ability to predict
[00:23:45] <causative_> true, but it's several steps removed from the laws of physics themselves
[00:23:58] <mycroftiv> quantum randomness is really deeply wired
[00:24:09] <mycroftiv> I cite W.H. Zurek a lot about these things
[00:24:15] <causative_> the Schrodinger equation is fully deterministic
[00:24:28] <causative_> nondeterminism is an unnecessary extra assumption in QM
[00:24:36] <mycroftiv> ok lets get precise on this
[00:24:38] <causative_> the consequence of accepting determinism in QM is just MWI
[00:24:46] <mycroftiv> lets get superprecise
[00:24:47] <causative_> MWI is deterministic
[00:25:18] <mycroftiv> i am in complete agreement and i think there is no disagreement at all
[00:25:28] <mycroftiv> between 'essential randomness' and 'deterministic many worlds'
[00:25:44] <mycroftiv> these are absolutely just two ways of saying the exact same thing about the actual observations we will make
[00:25:51] <mycroftiv> right?
[00:26:05] <mycroftiv> we have the exact same observed measurement outcomes
[00:26:25] <mycroftiv> in one case we are using the language of 'inherent randomness' in the other we are using the language of 'which branch of the multiverse'
[00:26:48] <causative_> well, there may be differences we could detect eventually
[00:26:50] <mycroftiv> and for extensional aspects of reality and measurements and predictions, we just have two ways of talking
[00:27:01] <causative_> in MWI, the apparent randomness - the born rule - is something emergent, not an absolute law
[00:27:09] <mycroftiv> you prefer the deterministic language with MWI right
[00:27:12] <mycroftiv> yes that is what Zurek is all about
[00:27:18] <mycroftiv> MWI emergence of Born's rule
[00:27:22] <causative_> so if you take the randomness as an absolute law, you're bound to eventually reach some different conclusions about observations than MWI would predict
[00:27:35] <causative_> because in MWI the born rule isn't absolute
[00:27:36] <mycroftiv> uh, do you have a source for that?
[00:28:18] <mycroftiv> i thought it was standard view that many worlds vs randomness had no differing experimental predictions
[00:28:29] <mycroftiv> but i like many worlds for discusion myself
[00:28:36] <mycroftiv> i am in agreement with you 100% on this
[00:28:56] <causative_> well, it doesn't yet, but there ought to be some difference eventually
[00:29:25] <causative_> the born rule is like the ideal gas law - it works in practice but it's not exactly what is happening, and with advanced enough theory and instruments the differences can be detected
[00:29:38] <causative_> and we don't have advanced enough theory and instruments yet
[00:29:42] <causative_> but someday we might
[00:29:58] <mycroftiv> interesting, Zurek discusses the Born law and deriving it rather than assuming it a lot
[00:30:54] <mycroftiv> quantum information theory and decoherence and many worlds and statistical emergencece of classicality and how the entropic aspects of cosmology work is one of the things ive tried to understand the most
[00:31:17] <mycroftiv> without full succeess! but i agree with what youve said about things
[00:31:42] <causative_> I don't expect the mathematics to *exactly* line up so that the born rule follows *precisely* from MWI
[00:32:05] <causative_> more likely, the born rule will only follow under certain assumptions that hold for the experiments we've done so far but might not hold in all cases
[00:32:25] <mycroftiv> have you ever heard of Exotic R4 physics? (slight tangent)
[00:32:32] <causative_> no
[00:32:41] <mycroftiv> its really interesting, its not crank ,but very speculative
[00:33:11] <mycroftiv> its based on the mathematical discovery that 4 dimensional manifolds have very unique topological possibilities, and trying to work out a way that physics might make use of them
[00:33:25] <mycroftiv> anyway, forget that, i might mention it later if relevant
[00:34:05] <mycroftiv> do you like string theory in the Witten vein? im guessing maybe not if you are sympathetic to Wolfram
[00:34:18] <causative_> I reserve judgment
[00:34:26] <causative_> I'm not a physicist, I leave it to the physicists
[00:35:01] <mycroftiv> i just want to understand the mathematical structure of reality as well as i can, so i try to read what they are doing and figure it out
[00:35:21] <causative_> it's enough for me that there's some kind of physical substrate - it doesn't matter too much to me exactly what it is. I'm more interested in studying minds.
[00:35:45] <mycroftiv> me too, the mathematical structure of the relation of mind to universe especially
[00:35:57] <causative_> like how I don't need to know, nor do I care too much, about the precise manufacturing process of the chips in the computer I'm using
[00:36:08] <mycroftiv> abstraction layers
[00:36:22] <causative_> I have a general idea of it, but not the specifics.  More interesting to me what can be done using the computer.
[00:37:12] <mycroftiv> indeed, i spend my days trying to learn math by teaching it to the computer in Agda :)
[00:37:32] <causative_> nice
[00:37:34] <causative_> if physicists eventually come out in a consensus and say "yes! this theory is great!" then I'll just accept what they say
[00:37:50] <causative_> they haven't yet, so I reserve judgment and accept as possible what the physicists say might be possible
[00:38:58] <mycroftiv> same here although im happy to try to learn the details of their theories and think about which seem to make the most sense to me

[02:11:30] <causative_> mycroftiv, if I can get a satisfactory mathematical notion of a system, the next step is to tackle consciousness - to say which systems are conscious and what, specifically, they are conscious of
[02:12:55] <mycroftiv> causative_: have you looked at Tononi's integrated information theory of consciousness?
[02:13:29] <causative_> my approach to this can be summarized by:  belief, objective, action (BOA).  An agent has a set of beliefs about the world, and an objective that it wants to achieve, and some actions to choose among. The agent always selects the action that it thinks best achieves the objective, according to its beliefs.
[02:13:56] <causative_> so what we do, is we take a system and attempt to model its behavior and internal state using BOA
[02:14:18] <causative_> and if we can do this, then we can say it is conscious - specifically, that it is conscious of its beliefs - and that it is acting intentionally to achieve its objective
[02:14:34] <mycroftiv> thats also literally used in the game optimization approaches to AI i think, deepmind is similar architecture
[02:14:53] <causative_> Tononi's integrated information theory makes the fundamental error of taking probability as fundamental
[02:15:32] <causative_> probability is something that is always relative to the mind of an agent - information theory (which depends on probability) makes no sense unless we *already* have an agent making judgments
[02:16:02] <causative_> so it's putting the cart before the horse - in IIT, agents are defined using information, which depends on probability, which depends on agents
[02:16:05] <causative_> circular
[02:16:28] <mycroftiv> well, theres always someone writing out the calculations at the metalevel, so im not sure that regress is really vicious
[02:17:07] <mycroftiv> but thats an interesting objective to Tononi's work i havent heard before
[02:17:10] <causative_> well, if that's how you resolve it, then you'd have to say that the level of consciousness of the agent analyzed depends on the beliefs (probability assignments) of the agent writing out the calculations
[02:17:21] <causative_> which seems unpalatable to say the least
[02:17:53] <mycroftiv> well, all of science in some ways is relativized to the observer performing the measurements and their methods and circumstances
[02:18:27] <causative_> but science always tries to jump the fence of the chicken pen of subjectivity and find the reality common to all
[02:18:33] <mycroftiv> how much we abstract away from that inescapable 'situatedness' of actually being embodied observers is kind of controversial
[02:19:05] <mycroftiv> really i agree science should describe my past and future light cone, but thats never what it does
[02:19:28] <mycroftiv> it works from a hypothetical global perspective that no observer in the universe can have
[02:19:42] <mycroftiv> this is something i think is a rather acute issue also
[02:19:52] <causative_> also, probability has other problems
[02:20:07] <causative_> not only is it subjective but humans are incapable of performing full Bayesian analysis - it's computationally intractable
[02:20:20] <causative_> humans don't assign consistent probabilities to events, and we don't correctly update our probabilities on new evidence
[02:20:38] <mycroftiv> we dont know that the universe itself is computationally tractable as a whole though
[02:20:39] <causative_> so not only is probability not fundamental to the universe, it's not fundamental to how humans think, either
[02:20:49] <mycroftiv> this is one the hardest problems for the computational wolfram style approaches
[02:20:55] <causative_> that wasn't my point
[02:21:24] <causative_> my point is that probability is a mathematical construction, an idealized approximation of how an agent might think, but no agent actually thinks that way
[02:21:32] <causative_> except in limited domains, or approximately
[02:21:50] <mycroftiv> i think that is a very valid perspective but not at all scientifically or mathematically demonstrated
[02:21:52] <causative_> so it's fundamental to neither the universe nor agents
[02:22:31] <causative_> there is plenty of scientific demonstration of how humans don't assign consistent sets of probabilities
[02:22:34] <mycroftiv> the perspective in which coin flips and dice rolls are actually what the universe is mostly made of is completely compatible with rationalist scientific materialism and is more convetional i think
[02:22:55] <mycroftiv> oh sure human subjectivity is just us being very unreliable in general, nobody is actually bayesian
[02:23:35] <causative_> it's a philosophical problem not a scientific problem - a philosophical problem about the nature of randomness
[02:23:53] <causative_> the nature of randomness is that it is always relative to an agent.
[02:23:53] <mycroftiv> i happen to think i have free will, because im random from your perspective
[02:24:08] <mycroftiv> from your viewpoint, i am somewhat unpredictable, exactly
[02:24:34] <mycroftiv> so my entropy relative to your observations is the scope of my randomness/free-will
[02:25:11] <mycroftiv> i can claim i have free will because i can behave as an unpredictable coin, from your viewpoint
[02:25:29] <mycroftiv> and of course you can claim im actually determined
[02:25:59] <mycroftiv> and i agree...up to extensional equivalence of observations, in which i will always have some degrees of freedom relative to your situated knowledge
[02:26:14] <causative_> well, I don't like the concept of "free will" at all, I don't think it's useful and it just causes confusion over terminology
[02:26:34] <causative_> the way most people use it, it doesn't really mean anything
[02:26:36] <mycroftiv> causative_: i cant give it up because it is my primary thing i notice about existence, is that i seem to be free to make choices
[02:27:06] <mycroftiv> and because i know randomness and freedom is entropy and unpredictability i can say that my free will is just what randomness feels like
[02:27:18] <causative_> if you study your own mind, you eventually start to notice how you do things because of specific motivations and justifications
[02:27:34] <causative_> you eat a sandwich, why?  because you were hungry and a sandwich was available.  That's causation.
[02:27:39] <mycroftiv> i can flip quantum coins to make decisions also though
[02:27:49] <mycroftiv> if i want to be random and unpredictable
[02:28:06] <mycroftiv> of course the vast majority of my actions are causally legible to outside observers and easily predictable
[02:28:21] <mycroftiv> but if i issue a 'prediction challenge' i can win
[02:28:25] <causative_> if you *randomly* do something, then you didn't *choose* to do it
[02:28:28] <causative_> it just happened by itself
[02:28:33] <causative_> because choice is a particular causal brain process
[02:28:39] <mycroftiv> no, not true - you as an observer cant tell the difference
[02:28:51] <causative_> if that causal brain process doesn't happen, because the action is totally random, then you are not in control
[02:28:53] <mycroftiv> you cant say there is a meaningful difference between me being 'random' and me making 'choices'
[02:28:55] <causative_> that's the exact opposite of control
[02:29:05] <causative_> I could if I had a powerful enough brain analyzer
[02:29:14] <mycroftiv> no, please dont say definitions are that canonical when definitions are under discussion, if we may
[02:29:24] <causative_> looking at how each neuron influences each other
[02:29:38] <mycroftiv> i am saying the conventional dichotomy between 'randomness' and 'chosen' is a confusion that is to be cleared up
[02:29:50] <mycroftiv> and in fact, 'randomness' and 'choice' are not antonyms
[02:30:05] <mycroftiv> randomness is what free choice looks like to external observers
[02:30:12] <mycroftiv> this is the mathematics of the situation
[02:30:16] <causative_> do we agree that choice is a causal process in the brain, in which beliefs combine with current objectives to yield an action?
[02:30:26] <mycroftiv> no
[02:30:35] <mycroftiv> 'choice' is not necessarily that
[02:30:53] <mycroftiv> my choice is whatever actions i actuallytake
[02:31:03] <mycroftiv> we do not know exactly what mechanism produces this in full detail
[02:31:26] <mycroftiv> i can take actions which are my choices which may not be purposeful in the definition you offered
[02:31:32] <causative_> what if someone put a chip in your head and pressed a button to make you take choice A, when what you wanted (your current objective) was choice B?
[02:31:41] <causative_> is that still your choice?
[02:31:53] <mycroftiv> uh probably not but idont think that has happened
[02:32:18] <causative_> ok now what if instead of the person pressing the button to make you take choice A, it was the decay of an atom to randomly make you take choice A with 50% probability?
[02:32:22] <causative_> is that your choice?
[02:32:26] <mycroftiv> yes absolutely
[02:32:37] <causative_> to be clear, the decay of the atom causes the button to press so that the chip in your head makes you take choice A
[02:32:44] <causative_> when what you wanted was choice B
[02:33:04] <causative_> still your choice?
[02:33:09] <mycroftiv> uh you just made a couple different scenarios then connected them so can we take things piece by piecee
[02:33:43] <mycroftiv> if we internalize all the atoms and chips inside my head
[02:33:48] <mycroftiv> thats just what my brain already is
[02:33:56] <mycroftiv> and its random processes are indeed my choices
[02:34:04] <causative_> no, because your brain is organized so that you do what you *want* to do
[02:34:14] <causative_> and *wanting* to do something is a particular physical state of the brain that leads to the action
[02:34:19] <causative_> it's not totally random
[02:34:24] <mycroftiv> i think all this is completely consistent
[02:34:29] <causative_> when you act according to what you want, you aren't acting randomly
[02:34:37] <mycroftiv> i certainly didnt claim things arent meaningful and purposeful
[02:34:51] <mycroftiv> only that random choices exist as one corner case
[02:34:58] <causative_> when you're acting randomly, you're breaking the causal chain between what you want and what you do - which means you *aren't* doing what you want
[02:35:07] <mycroftiv> no, i can want to be random
[02:35:20] <mycroftiv> i can say ' i want to move my elbows unpredictably 'and then start doing so
[02:35:20] <causative_> well, that's fair, but usually you don't want to be random
[02:35:25] <mycroftiv> and challenge you to predict them
[02:35:36] <mycroftiv> and ill have some quantum random coin i use to decide the motions
[02:35:51] <mycroftiv> but yes of course if i choose to eat a sandwich
[02:36:00] <mycroftiv> that is a predictable and mostly predetermined choice
[02:36:14] <causative_> in that case the motions aren't your choice, your choice is the choice to move randomly, and that's a non-random choice, driven by what you wanted - to be unpredictable
[02:36:31] <causative_> then that choice to move randomly triggered a random machine that started your arms moving
[02:36:38] <mycroftiv> this is entirely definitional so i dont disagree that using your definitions, that is correct
[02:36:39] <causative_> and from then on your actions weren't your choice
[02:36:43] <mycroftiv> but i do not use those exact definitions
[02:37:20] <mycroftiv> and i reserve 'choice' definitionally to include actions which may or may not be entirely random, but are still linked into my actions
[02:37:25] <causative_> but anyway you have something inconsistent because you said when a person presses the button to make you take choice A that you didn't want, then it's not your choice
[02:37:36] <mycroftiv> such as unpredictable elbow motions i make while watching quantum coins or whatever
[02:37:36] <causative_> but if a quantum coin flip presses the same button, then it is your choice?
[02:37:40] <causative_> that doesn't make a lot of sense to me
[02:37:43] <mycroftiv> if thte button is OUTSIDE me
[02:37:50] <causative_> what does it matter whether the button is outside or inside?
[02:37:57] <mycroftiv> if the person is a tiny person inside my head made of my cells pushing the button, thats ME
[02:38:22] <mycroftiv> so it makes huge difference if we physically place the causal button pusher outside my skull or not
[02:38:30] <causative_> your self isn't defined by the boundaries of your skull
[02:38:43] <mycroftiv> now thats a super deep point i agree with completely
[02:38:53] <causative_> it's entirely conceivable to have your brain divided into multiple pieces, miles apart, communicating with each other
[02:39:00] <causative_> and some of the pieces could be artificial computers
[02:39:03] <causative_> and you'd still be you
[02:39:08] <causative_> so this outside/inside distinction doesn't work
[02:39:21] <mycroftiv> story of a brain by zuboff is all about this yeah
[02:39:46] <krb> there also unknowns in the universe that could affect things in ways we doesn't understand. like the double slit problem
[02:39:49] <causative_> so again, you have this inconsistency, where if the person presses the button you say it's not your choice, but if a quantum coin flip presses the button you say it is your choice
[02:39:59] <causative_> and in both cases you did something you didn't want to do
[02:40:22] <causative_> and this time you can't resort to whether the button is outside or inside your physical skull because we agree that's not relevant
[02:40:24] <mycroftiv> the problem is at some point you lose any 'self' at all and its more like that person was saying earlier, and indivisible continuum of causal links with no meaningful boundary
[02:40:42] <causative_> no, there is a way to unify the pieces
[02:40:45] <mycroftiv> your own formal analysis makes use of system-environment decomposition as a basic aspect does it not?
[02:40:50] <causative_> and that way is to ask whether they are acting together towards a common goal
[02:41:02] <causative_> if they are doing so, then they are part of the same agent, no matter how far apart they may be
[02:41:18] <mycroftiv> the whole universe is still part of me then in alot of ways
[02:41:30] <causative_> (or rather, more specifically, acting together towards a common goal based on a consistent distributed set of beliefs)
[02:41:30] <mycroftiv> its very hard to sort out my internal purposes from the external cause chains
[02:41:50] <krb> theres also things science have failed to properly address. like astrology, ghosts, telepathy...
[02:41:54] <causative_> I don't think so - goal-oriented behavior is special
[02:41:58] <mycroftiv> let me be clear - i really like and agree with the overall model and description of things you give
[02:42:25] <mycroftiv> the specific issue about how the word 'choice' should be understood in relation to boundaries of an agent is a point of differing view i agree
[02:42:25] <causative_> if you kick a rock, "you plus the rock you kick" isn't an agent acting towards your goals
[02:42:41] <causative_> because the rock's motions aren't aligned with your goals and beliefs
[02:42:53] <causative_> that's what makes the rock outside
[02:43:04] <mycroftiv> i think the sensory perceptions are way more direct]
[02:43:09] <mycroftiv> i cant feel what the rock feels
[02:43:12] <mycroftiv> i do feel what i feel
[02:43:21] <causative_> yes, in the BOA model, what you feel is part of your beliefs
[02:43:26] <mycroftiv> i dont think you need to use the purposefulness of my assemblage and actions to draw the distinction
[02:43:33] <causative_> you can't feel what the rock feels, therefore you don't have the beliefs of the rock, therefore the rock and you are different agents
[02:43:36] *** Quits: folio (~oldfolio@98.20.113.18) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:43:51] <causative_> you can't use what the rock experiences to guide your own actions, ergo, it's separate from you
[02:43:53] <mycroftiv> thats not the minimal path to the deduction though
[02:43:59] <mycroftiv> so we agree
[02:44:37] <mycroftiv> but i think perception and awareness is the more direct way to make these distinctions
[02:44:44] <causative_> oh, along the way - beliefs are meaningful only to the extent that they guide your actions or could potentially guide your actions if other information was present
[02:45:25] <causative_> if you have a belief that doesn't affect your actions ever - that isn't relevant to your goal - then in what way do you have that belief?  It's disconnected from you.  You can't even say that you have the belief, because to say you have it is to pursue a goal that requires  the belief.
[02:45:36] <mycroftiv> cant i believe some number is prime just because it IS?
[02:45:41] <mycroftiv> without any need for goals?
[02:46:03] <causative_> there are all sorts of ways you could use your knowledge that a number is prime to guide your actions towards your objectives
[02:46:15] <mycroftiv> but i dont HAVE to, in order to have the belief
[02:46:22] <causative_> you have to have the potential to
[02:46:40] <mycroftiv> ok i think the view of consciousness as related to goal directed behaviors is really insightful
[02:46:53] <causative_> if you don't have that potential, what happens if you are given a test where they ask "Is 23 prime?"
[02:47:05] <causative_> you can't answer because you don't have the potential to let your belief that 23 is prime guide your action
[02:47:10] <mycroftiv> but im not sure relativizing all definitions to depend on that framework is really that helpful to clarity
[02:47:16] <causative_> so if you can't answer a question like that, in what sense do you have the belief?
[02:47:47] <mycroftiv> i believe a number is prime because of observable properties it has when i do calculations
[02:48:13] <mycroftiv> this does not inherently conceptually depend on the fact that i do calculations in the first place because i probably have a goal
[02:48:16] <causative_> that's what *caused* you to believe the number is prime, that's not the *definition* of believing the number is prime
[02:48:28] <mycroftiv> i agree that as a near tautology, we do what we do because we have a reason to do it
[02:48:30] <causative_> the *definition* of believing the number is prime, is what you can do with that belief, downstream
[02:48:36] <causative_> I make a distinction between upstream meaning and downstream meaning
[02:48:53] <causative_> the upstream meaning of a proposition X, is the ways in which we can deduce X from sets of other propositions
[02:49:07] <causative_> the downstream meaning of a proposition X, is what we can deduce from X when combined with sets of other propositions
[02:49:20] <causative_> you were talking about the upstream meaning
[02:49:33] <causative_> when you said "i believe a number is prime because of observable properties it has when i do calculations," that's upstream meaning
[02:49:53] <causative_> but I'm talking about the downstream meaning - specifically, the downstream meaning in relation to deciding which actions best achieve your objectives
[02:50:18] <mycroftiv> that is very clear, thank you
[02:50:53] <mycroftiv> i understand what you say and i dont have any disagreements of fact and your definitions are all well-worked out and consistent
[02:51:54] <mycroftiv> you speak a bit as if your definitions are the standard canonical definitions or 'true' in some deep way, when i think all defintions are contingent, and yours seem fairly specialized to your own work, which is fine
[02:52:17] <causative_> well, thank you :) anyway I think there is an intuition I'm trying to convey though, that goes beyond definitions
[02:52:26] <mycroftiv> just that i want to be able to use other definitions if i can be clear about what definitions im using and if i think they are more standard sometimes
[02:52:28] <mycroftiv> oh yes
[02:52:42] <mycroftiv> i am saying, i think the way you are -understanding things- is really deep and insightful
[02:52:51] <mycroftiv> you arent just making abstract definitions
[02:52:57] <mycroftiv> you are drawing a useful map
[02:52:59] <causative_> which is that if you are acting randomly in a way you *don't want* - i.e. in a way not causally determined by your brain patterns of desire - then that's *unpleasant*, it's not what you judge good.
[02:53:16] <causative_> and "free will" usually carries a connotation that it's something you would judge good
[02:53:37] <mycroftiv> certainly, maximizing utility, that kind of thing
[02:53:59] <mycroftiv> i know my own definitions are deliberately nonstandard on saying that randomness and free will are not opposites
[02:54:20] <ldlework> "random will" thinking emoji
[02:54:21] <mycroftiv> this is also more than just playing with defintions, like you, i have a point im making
[02:54:50] <mycroftiv> the idea that -embracing randomness- is a very interesting and powerful thing is part of it
[02:55:05] <mycroftiv> deliberately making your choices depend on as random a coin as you can flip
[02:55:07] <ldlework> why is it interesting
[02:55:09] <ldlework> why is it powerful
[02:55:15] <mycroftiv> because of the mathematics of uncountability
[02:55:24] <ldlework> that's just a name
[02:55:30] <ldlework> it doesn't explain either question
[02:55:33] <mycroftiv> and because only through randomness can we NOT be limited to turing machine outputs
[02:55:34] <ldlework> you didn't say which one you're answering
[02:55:46] <causative_> well, deliberately making your choices depend on randomness is an important kind of strategy in game theory
[02:55:52] <mycroftiv> by using randomness i can be unpredictable and prove that im not a turing machine
[02:55:59] <mycroftiv> and yes game theoretically as well
[02:56:16] <causative_> that's called a "mixed strategy"
[02:56:24] <mycroftiv> poker players find ways to randomize their choices
[02:56:46] <ldlework> employing randomness as strategy somehow seems precisely distinction from a will that is itself random and can't employ any particular strategy
[02:56:50] <mycroftiv> in a mathematical sense, creating random bitstrings is interesting
[02:57:32] <causative_> yes, the choice of which mixed strategy to use is still a deterministic one
[02:57:43] <mycroftiv> Martin-Löf randomness is connected to Cohen forcing and random reals in models of set theory like Solovay's
[02:57:47] <causative_> one motivated by what you want - your objectives
[02:57:56] <ldlework> causative_: does mycroftiv still beleieve in real randomness
[02:58:10] <mycroftiv> i believe in the mathematics of quantum mechanics
[02:58:18] <ldlework> so
[02:58:32] <mycroftiv> which can be seen as involving 'true randomness' or not depending on philosophical choices that dont change the observations
[02:58:48] <ldlework> so "yes"
[02:59:12] <mycroftiv> yes but i can speak and agree with a quantum hidden variables or many worlds determinist fine
[02:59:22] <mycroftiv> its not observationally distinguishable
[02:59:23] <ldlework> okay
[02:59:25] <causative_> I think he's saying he doesn't think the distinction is important, that what matters is the predictions of the theory
[02:59:35] <mycroftiv> there may be contexts it is important
[02:59:43] <mycroftiv> but we just need to be totally precise
[03:00:04] <mycroftiv> about when we are speaking of intensional true nature vs extensional observations
[03:00:51] <mycroftiv> this association of free will and randomness is about extensional equivalencee to external observers
[03:01:02] <ldlework> mycroftiv: given empirical equal ground of a number of metaphysicially incompatible models
[03:01:12] <ldlework> how do you feel about realism
[03:01:20] <ldlework> there's a binary modal here, even if we don't know what model is true
[03:01:33] <mycroftiv> i take materialist reductionist realism as a default starting plce for communication
[03:01:39] <ldlework> nice
[03:01:47] <mycroftiv> i dont think it is exhaustive of what can be meaningfully said though
[03:01:52] <ldlework> but what i mean is
[03:01:57] <ldlework> i'm asking your view on realism
[03:01:59] <ldlework> if you have N models
[03:02:06] <ldlework> which are metaphysically incompatible
[03:02:12] <ldlework> but empiricially indistinguishable
[03:02:29] <ldlework> do you believe something like "one (or some other model we don't have) is how it actually is"
[03:02:33] <mycroftiv> im happy to regard them as all equally real
[03:02:33] <ldlework> or
[03:02:36] <ldlework> given the empiricial indis- ok
[03:02:47] <mycroftiv> im very ontologically liberal
[03:03:03] <mycroftiv> just be precise about how we make measurements if possible and communicate about them and what criteria are
[03:03:16] <ldlework> when it comes to things that are on the face
[03:03:19] <ldlework> metaphysically incompatible
[03:03:28] <ldlework> i have a light intuition that it's really a matter of articulation
[03:03:52] <ldlework> our models are articulated just vaguely enough to be simulatenously correct, but not specific enough to exclude each other
[03:04:10] <causative_> AIXI can provide some clarity here - AIXI maintains an infinity of models as possibly true, and with each observation, crosses out all the models that were incompatible with that observation
[03:04:33] <mycroftiv> that is a lot like quantum sheaf models of emergent reality with ultrafilters that i study
[03:04:42] <causative_> what does AIXI "believe," then, when it has so many different models that all generate the observations but are different from each other?
[03:04:55] <ldlework> causative_: clearly not the ones it excluded
[03:05:06] <causative_> yes not those, but what of the ones it didn't exclude?
[03:05:19] <ldlework> it's fine for there to be an infintie number of articulating the same model
[03:05:22] <ldlework> but what's also possible
[03:05:24] <causative_> they're different models
[03:05:33] <ldlework> modeling the same phenomena
[03:05:33] <causative_> an infinite number of contradictions among them
[03:05:36] <mycroftiv> ok this whole issue of a multitude of different models which are all consistent and all generated from a common ground is pretty well articulated in model theory with ultraproducts i believe
[03:05:47] <ldlework> sure, i'm not disputing that at all
[03:05:52] <ldlework> what i'm saying that's also possible
[03:05:58] <ldlework> is that you can have an incomplete model
[03:06:09] <ldlework> which in it's incompleteness, allows compatibility with other models
[03:06:13] <ldlework> which given a further description
[03:06:18] <ldlework> would then cause them to become disjoint
[03:06:21] <ldlework> just like previously happened
[03:06:29] <ldlework> with all the models that were previously discarded
[03:06:44] <mycroftiv> there are branch points and disjunctions yes - do you know kripke semantics at all?
[03:06:53] <ldlework> no
[03:07:08] <mycroftiv> modal logic of how you progress along possible worlds, similar to forcing in set theory, has sheaf-topos interpretation
[03:07:24] <ldlework> ah modal logic, possible workds
[03:07:28] <mycroftiv> its very much what you are saying with lots of mathematical/logical notation
[03:07:33] <ldlework> sure
[03:07:38] <ldlework> i'm just saying
[03:07:41] <ldlework> if you have two models
[03:07:45] <ldlework> and they seem equally compatible
[03:07:52] <ldlework> it can either be true that you have two ways of saying the same thing
[03:07:56] <ldlework> or you haven't said enough
[03:07:58] <ldlework> that's all
[03:08:21] <mycroftiv> that seems mathematically solid really
[03:08:44] <mycroftiv> you have partial orders on 'forcing conditions' that describe what you know has to be true at a given point in time
[03:09:00] <mycroftiv> the models that can exist given the set of accumulated conditions
[03:09:27] <mycroftiv> however there is still a family of varying non-identical consistent models often
[03:09:36] <mycroftiv> this is the point i think is very interesting
[03:10:11] <mycroftiv> even after going through an infinite process of progressive information refinement to eliminate models, we can still have an infinite family of non-identical models that fulfill all the conditions
[03:10:13] <causative_> AIXI can have equivalent models and it technically believes each of them with equal probability
[03:10:20] *** Quits: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:10:30] <ldlework> i mean it draws into question what it means to be either of those things if you can be both at the same time
[03:10:45] <ldlework> homotopy theory comes to mind
[03:11:02] <causative_> like it can have program P1 that is formally the same as program P2, and it believes P1 with some probability and P2 with a different probability, the difference coming from AIXI's description-length prior
[03:11:07] <mycroftiv> yes, i formalize these things somewhat in homotopy type theory, which isnt exactly like homotopy theory, but kinda close
[03:11:17] <ldlework> mycroftiv: but you get my point
[03:11:44] <ldlework> at some higher order space there will by some homotopy between these supposedly somehow "Actually Distinct" models
[03:11:58] <mycroftiv> causative_: i guess you have no issues with using probabilistic things within formalisms just as tools then?
[03:12:20] <causative_> probabilities are good for modeling beliefs of an ideal agent such as AIXI, mycroftiv
[03:12:22] <mycroftiv> ldlework: hmm that is very interesting statement actually

[03:18:29] <mycroftiv> hmm referenceces Coecke, ive looked at his quantum stuff a little
[03:18:31] <ldlework> they didn't even "unify" it
[03:18:50] <ldlework> they both emerge properly from multiway dynamics
[03:19:10] <ldlework> one in the spacial hypergraph, one in the branchial graph

[03:23:55] <ldlework> just to get warmed up
[03:24:29] <mycroftiv> yea im familiar with the wolfram school of ideas, im generally sympathetic to exploring it deeply
[03:25:37] <ldlework> i can't wait for you to get to the livestreams where they are sitting around trying  to understand the consequence on epistemology of observers of the graph being computationally bounded sub-parts of the graph and stuff
[03:25:54] <mycroftiv> 'the topology of causal relationships' as fundamental is definitely a good starting place
[03:25:56] <ldlework> sometimes i can't help but to giggle because it's just such a foreign kind of content
[03:26:21] <mycroftiv> actually why we observe 4dimensional manifold as observers is really interesting
[03:26:22] <ldlework> crazy smart people, in realtime, having true dialectic, about things that are making me pee my pants
[03:26:35] <mycroftiv> that exotic R4 physics i mentioned earlier is somewhat of a take on that
[03:27:01] <mycroftiv> there is distinctive topological possibilities in 4manifolds related to exotic smooth structure because of Freedman's disc embedding theorem

[03:27:31] <mycroftiv> in fact i wonder if any wolfram people have considered computation happening with that exact structure
[03:27:48] <ldlework> when you said
[03:27:49] <mycroftiv> computational processes of building the Casson handles that characterize smooth exotic R4 manifolds
[03:27:50] <ldlework> > in practice there is a nice global foliation that we can see in the universe so the observations are consistent with something like that
[03:28:11] <ldlework> I suspected you might be interested in wolfram's work

[03:31:20] <mycroftiv> yep, trying to figure out constructive computation that can accomodate the rich logical structure observed in reality
[03:34:29] <ldlework> mycroftiv: they have this backroom theory, i dunno if they've written about it, but it has come up a number of time in the livestreams, regarding the homotopical limit, the infinite groupoid, and the eventual conclusion that at the very end of the day, there really can only be one possible "Universe", because ultimately all the "possible universes" we may think of as being as distinct, are
[03:34:31] <ldlework> actually the same Universe in some ultimately nessecary sense.
[03:35:18] <mycroftiv> ok i understand that idea and its cool but i also think things might be exactly the opposite way
[03:35:37] <mycroftiv> reality is not just 'up to homotopy' the way constructive computation is
[03:36:09] <mycroftiv> IF you are thinking that reality must be a constructive computation, then it will almost certainly be within the PIW topos of constructive type theories of that homotopical limit
[03:36:45] <mycroftiv> BUT if you think that strong set theory ideas like large cardinal axioms might be part of how reality is actually made, you can say there could be infinite logically similar yet non-identical models
[03:37:09] <mycroftiv> because that homotopical limit assumes things are fundamentally computable
[03:37:22] <mycroftiv> which is a basic assumption of the cellular automatona computability approach often
[03:37:43] <mycroftiv> i want more magic in my reality so i went looking for mathematics beyond this limit,and found large cardinal axioms
[03:38:01] <ldlework> mycroftiv: can you describe a graph substitution situtation where you couldn't compute the next step given the conditions laid out for hypergraph substitution?
[03:38:07] <mycroftiv> a way to maintain a mathematically objective concept of reality but one with more scope for seemingly 'subjective' flexibility ofperspective
[03:38:42] <mycroftiv> ldlework: uh project the appropriate combinatorial consequences of a large cardinal axiom - i think Harvey Friedman has these results for graphs
[03:39:17] <ldlework> mycroftiv: can you just give me a practical example. i have a potentially large graph. i have a series of rewrite rules. i can update the graph anywhere a rule applies.
[03:39:20] <ldlework> what's noncomputable here?
[03:39:38] <ldlework> did you mean something else?
[03:40:38] <mycroftiv> i dont know Friedman's work or graph theory rewrite systems in enough detail to know what if any of his examples applies specifically
[03:41:02] <mycroftiv> i can discuss this mathematical issue in detail and perhaps connect to graph applications via infinite binary hypercube

[03:42:51] <mycroftiv> we have this infinitely existing infinitely branching background prior to the big bang that is very mathematically intractable if it makes sense
[03:43:09] <ldlework> mycroftiv: in a hypergraph rewrite system
[03:43:11] <ldlework> think about this
[03:43:14] <ldlework> you have some rules
[03:43:16] <ldlework> and it just happens
[03:43:20] <ldlework> that in certain configurations
[03:43:27] <ldlework> the rule causes a partitioning of the graph
[03:43:30] <ldlework> why not?
[03:43:33] <mycroftiv> yes its like ramsey theory
[03:43:50] <mycroftiv> you get inherent order from sufficiently large combinatorial configuration spacee
[03:44:10] <ldlework> but it's an explanation for inflation
[03:44:14] <ldlework> that doesn't require crossing the singularity
[03:44:26] <ldlework> maybe universes just start off as small island-ed graphs?
[03:44:30] <ldlework> "universes"
[03:44:40] <ldlework> ignoring the wider sense of universe here
[03:45:10] <ldlework> if there's no rule to ever combine two islands
[03:45:25] <ldlework> but only partitioning..
[03:46:15] <ldlework> sub-graphs in each island would have the sort of limits that we take on for universes, causality, etc
[03:46:21] <ldlework> sub-graphs, aka agents, computers, etc
[03:47:57] <mycroftiv> yeah you really want a sensible universe that naturally recovers the observables to fall out of your ideas
[03:48:09] <ldlework> mycroftiv: have you ever heard the notion of fractional dimensionality, like doing differntial geometry in non-integer number of dimensions
[03:48:16] <mycroftiv> certainly
[03:48:30] <ldlework> interesting. their complaint is largely that as a field it doesn't exist.
[03:48:55] <mycroftiv> the infinite self-similar structures generated by recursive processes are the usual example
[03:49:11] <ldlework> right but try to do differential geometry
[03:49:24] <ldlework> mycroftiv: in the hypergraph they have this notion for measuring local dimensionality
[03:49:29] <ldlework> basically start off with some node
[03:49:34] <ldlework> then add all of its neighbors
[03:49:37] <mycroftiv> i cant do differential geometry even if im not inside a fractal cascade computational hypergraph
[03:49:38] <ldlework> then all of its neighbors
[03:49:57] <ldlework> in 2 dimensions, the "ball" should grow at a certain rate, at 3 dimensions the ball should grow at a certain rate
[03:50:05] <ldlework> you're probably familiar with the notion
[03:50:17] <ldlework> but in some arbitrary graph, this process is not likely to produce integer results
[03:50:28] <ldlework> mycroftiv: haha

[03:51:28] <ldlework> wolfram et al, theorize that likely early "universes" are potentially infinitely dimensional and that as the spatial hypergraph evolves, it settles down to approximate 3 dimensions
[03:51:55] <mycroftiv> yeah ive been working on that idea in the context of the freedman topological results i mentioned
[03:52:06] <ldlework> but this would mean that you could have local dimensionality in places in the universe under some conditions with sliiiiiiightly non-3 dimensionality
[03:52:07] <mycroftiv> just not all in terms of graph theory myself
[03:52:28] <ldlework> that's something that you could potentially test if one had reason to look
[03:52:45] <mycroftiv> although the binary hypercubic graph represented just by infinite binary bitstrings and its subsequences and the relation to simplicial complexes is really important to me also
[03:53:20] <mycroftiv> i find that canonical structure easier to reason about than multigraphs in full generality but im just getting started on this ZX calculus stuff
[03:53:41] <ldlework> wolfram often says there's plenty of other ways you could say the same thing but hypergraphs are curiously fruitful
[03:54:01] <ldlework> mycroftiv: to me when you start thinking about quantum mechanics and stuff, things like multiway graphs are pretty intuitive
[03:54:11] <ldlework> casual graphs, branchial graphs, rulial graphs
[03:54:25] <mycroftiv> i think about trees a lot so yes absolutely
[03:54:26] <ldlework> each perfectly nests inside the other and there's a nice narrative about each
[03:55:10] <mycroftiv> the basic infinite binary tree cantor set self similar structure that represents the powerset lattice of the naturals is kind of my home base
[03:55:44] <mycroftiv> because its just functions from Nat -> Bool and has crucial mathematical correlations with axiom of choice via Weak König's Lemma
[03:56:05] <mycroftiv> this is just how ive been working towards a richer view like these wolfram researchers have
[03:57:16] <mycroftiv> looking at the simplest canonical infinite graph structures used in conventional math and how they fit in constructive computer programming, this categorical quantum diagram wolfram graph calculus is def a step up :)
[03:58:04] <mycroftiv> "whilst  the  X-spiders  are  used  to  denote  states/unitary  operators/linear  isometries/projections/etc. with respect to the Hadamard-transformed basis"
[04:00:37] <mycroftiv> whoa page 30 of this, the diagram...[brain melts] - the Z and X spider fulsion rules
[04:03:58] <mycroftiv> ok this whole central body of this paper is enumerating the specific rules in detail for all these Z and X spider operations and its cool but totally not human readable or really intended to be, its like documenting their computer code
[04:04:47] <ldlework> mycroftiv: their model is fundamentally computational, and they're the inventors of mathematica, so are you really surprised
[04:05:08] <ldlework> during the livestreams, they will have trouble getting the point across and they'll be like "let me just whip up an example here in mathematica"
[04:05:14] <ldlework> and produce some explanatory graph, it's amazing content

[13:08:48] <assan> so about the philosophy of osetura
[13:09:28] <assan> this philosophy says that through osun mila becomes osetura
[13:09:56] <assan> osun being the archetype of care
[13:10:11] <assan> mila being the archetype of knowledge
[13:10:35] <assan> and osetura being the archetype of a finished product
[13:10:40] <assan> like copper
[13:10:58] <assan> osetura would be copper in it's final form
[13:11:02] <arryana> doesn't it just seem more sensible to ban a chatter that never chats when it disrupts things for other people?
[13:11:38] <assan> while mila would be cuprite
[13:11:48] <assan> that's the ore of copper
[13:12:20] <assan> and then osun would be the processes between cuprite and pure copper
[13:12:31] <mnemon> arryana: sure, but no need for others to suffer while the ops are contemplating the issue P

[13:12:44] <assan> this is the old african divine trinity of the past
[13:13:00] <assan> as we come into life
[13:13:26] <assan> the goal is to become osetura by the careful examination of our being
[13:13:52] *** solveig is now known as litha
[13:14:27] <assan> we understand that the nature of things begin as unprocessed
[13:14:52] <assan> thus the quest for the philosophers stone, the pure human
[13:15:36] <assan> so we are all liars
[13:16:04] <assan> but with the consciousness of applying care to our tongue
[13:16:17] <assan> we become a more truthful people
[13:16:34] <assan> we all have greed in our hearts
[13:17:08] <assan> but when we see the effect of greed we should watch our hearts into content
[13:17:26] <assan> this is really the end goal for the human life
[13:18:04] <assan> to convert our rash self to something more subtle for lack of words
[13:19:10] <assan> how to apply osun in different characters may differ
[13:19:25] <assan> so we call them the characters of man
[13:20:17] <assan> for those interested in the investigation of being
[13:20:26] <assan> the ultimate parampara
[13:20:47] <assan> we suggest you list the characters of man

[13:21:03] <assan> envy
[13:21:10] <assan> stubbornness
[13:21:18] <assan> disrespect

[13:21:52] <assan> carelessness

[13:22:30] <assan> like me i can have a lieing tongue
[13:23:17] <assan> i have some pride too
[13:23:44] <assan> my osun would be to watch my pride into more humility

[13:37:51] <arryana> please tell, lumi
[13:38:07] <assan> go ahead Lumine
[13:41:23] <Lumine> It involves the way we assume things over typed text. I'm speaking entirely from personal encounters. People think that they have it figured out what I'm about just by few lines of text in IRC. For example, I was accused of assuming people's beliefs over one sentence, in which I used an old proverb. That's it. Nothing to do with assuming what they thought about things. My point is that we're dealing with very few bits of information, to draw
[13:41:23] <Lumine> our conclusions. And that is the reason it often leads to misunderstandings in such a platform.

[13:42:54] <arryana> hm
[13:43:10] <arryana> is that interaction from the other day still bothering you
[13:43:12] <arryana> ?
[13:43:25] <Lumine> It is, because they kept ignoring me since then
[13:43:28] <arryana> thing is, everyone is misunderstood.
[13:43:30] <arryana> so let them
[13:43:38] <arryana> why does that bother you?
[13:46:22] <Lumine> It's not bothering much anymore, but the reason is because we are friends, or were friends. I don't know anymore.
[13:47:00] <assan> friendship can wear out
[13:47:15] <assan> when our natures reveal themselves
[13:47:38] <arryana> ah.
[13:47:40] <arryana> well.
[13:47:59] <assan> we find that what we loved about a person underweigh the things we find we dislike about them
[13:48:30] <arryana> my experience of such things is that if you were real friends, time and common experiences will bring you back together once their feelings are less raw.  if you were not really friends, now you know and you have time and energy to spend more on people who are more compatible
[13:48:31] <Lumine> I still think that's a valid point, that we use very little verbal information to the detriment of our interactions with people.
[13:48:55] <arryana> even the people we know best only understand some things about us, and think they know us better than they do
[13:49:16] <arryana> being misunderstood is just the basic reality, and we work out as much as we can in spite of it
[13:51:20] <Lumine> Yeah, I've had lots of them
[13:51:47] <pussipupu> All you can do is try to present yourself honestly and try to interpret people honestly

[14:17:28] <arryana> i absolutely love those malapropisms when people hear a word they don't know and then mistake it for something else.

[14:17:42] <arryana> i just heard a worse one.
[14:18:07] <arryana> someone asked me how dogs and cats could have young with each other.
[14:18:45] <arryana> because they heard someone say 'kit and caboodle' and heard 'kitten ca-poodle'
[14:18:52] <arryana> and thought it was a breed of kitten.
[14:19:35] <arryana> now my next cat is going to have to be kitten capoodle.

[22:18:42] * iryith bangs pots and pans around the channel while screaming wildly 
[22:19:05] <mycroftiv> im ready to philosophize or listen to philosophy
[22:21:38] <iryith> Do you have a personal philosophy or set of ideals that you adhere to and how does that relate to your psychological well-being on a daily basis?
[22:25:50] <mycroftiv> iryith: as perhaps over-pretentious as it sounds, i dont know how to have breakfast without thinking about what the Best Breakfast I should eat is, from a philosophical standpoint merging the ethical and practical concerns
[22:26:29] *** Quits: Ungwelian (Every1@88-113-233-225.elisa-laajakaista.fi) (Quit: Z_z :))
[22:26:38] <iryith> are you vegan?
[22:26:39] <mycroftiv> in practice this means trying to understand as much math and science as possible and gather as much accurate data as possible and then make decisions in accordance with whatever values i can distill as relevant to where i am in spacetime and what i am
[22:26:48] <mycroftiv> iryith: no, vegetarian
[22:27:19] <mycroftiv> although i actually after 20+ years started eating some fish due to poor health and concerns about some fatty acids relevant to my arthritis. i feel concerned about this karmically
[22:27:48] <mycroftiv> because Bhagavad-Gita concepts seem to fit with my rational scientific understanding overall
[22:27:49] <iryith> Humans have a really hard time being strict vegetarians
[22:28:13] <mycroftiv> i have always been lacto-ovo and eaten eggs and dairy, just spent 25 years with no flesh
[22:28:59] <iryith> I always considered going vegetarian, but the time and effort involved in daily meal preparation is fairly restrictive for a very active lifestyle
[22:29:49] <mycroftiv> i think living a morally good life does not require abstaining from meat. i try to do so personally but dont believe anyone else is wrong for their own choices.
[22:30:06] <mycroftiv> being born into the world and figuring out how to survive, its hard
[22:30:16] * arryana puts fish in iryith's pots
[22:30:34] <iryith> is your moral compass pointing more toward the human aspect of it, like for example being kind to other humans, or is it more encompassing of everything around you?
[22:30:41] <mycroftiv> not all actions one takes to survive are necessarily morally justified on that basis, but at ground 'ya gotta eat to live' is morally sensible i think
[22:31:00] <iryith> arryana, if I slap a fish hard enough and enough times I can cook it with friction. I'll keep banging it with a spoon and see what happens
[22:31:10] <arryana> haha
[22:31:24] <mycroftiv> iryith: in theory i think every atom is beautiful and divine and maybe conscious because of panpsychism so i should harmonize with humans and animals and mountains and galaxies and make them all happy
[22:31:44] <iryith> mycroftiv, where I live eating whale is socially acceptable and you can buy it in the store. It's incredibly nutritious and I could put it under the "ya gotta eat to live" category. Is that still a morally acceptable decision?
[22:31:44] <arryana> why would plants be any different than animals to a panpsychic?
[22:31:50] <mycroftiv> in practice i do not know what i should do to help the andromeda galaxy be happy so i mostly pay attention to humans
[22:32:08] <mycroftiv> humans are more intensely conscious i think it is kinda clear?
[22:32:19] <iryith> are they?
[22:32:22] <mycroftiv> if a rock is conscious, i doubt its consciousness is very focal and intense
[22:32:24] <iryith> or is it just easier to recognize
[22:32:26] <mycroftiv> i believe so
[22:32:32] <mycroftiv> if rocks had mouths they could maybe talk
[22:32:39] <mycroftiv> but what are they thinking>? slow rocky thoughts
[22:32:52] * arryana waits to hear from the expert on that
[22:32:54] <mycroftiv> i mean none of this is certain, im just answering as asked
[22:33:03] <iryith> dunno, radioactive decay; is a pretty fast process in the moment (albeit long overall)
[22:33:17] <iryith> -;
[22:33:23] <mycroftiv> so maybe we should somehow view breaking a rock as equal to breaking a skull but i think that is just Too Far
[22:33:32] <mycroftiv> my human view that i care more about humans makes sense to me
[22:33:34] <arryana> that's a thing i don't get about vegetarians/vegans.  do they want every other omnivore/carnivore to stop eating meat?
[22:33:49] <arryana> i mean, is a tiger obligated to be a vegetarian to them?
[22:34:00] <mycroftiv> in a perfect world we probably feed the tigers delicious tofubeast
[22:34:07] <arryana> oh god, no
[22:34:15] <mycroftiv> why should animals suffer though?
[22:34:20] <iryith> arryana, that fits into the religion category as well. If you truly believe in the tenets of it then you are obliged to get everyone you care about to believe the same
[22:34:24] <mycroftiv> if a tiger can have an equally good meal
[22:34:29] <mycroftiv> without another animal suffering
[22:34:33] <iryith> because biology
[22:34:37] <arryana> it isn't an equally good meal to the tiger
[22:34:43] <mycroftiv> i said IF
[22:34:48] <arryana> but it isn't
[22:34:50] <mycroftiv> IF we can do this
[22:34:53] <arryana> but you can't
[22:34:56] <mycroftiv> i did not say this can be done currently
[22:35:13] <iryith> now labgrown meat is a train I can definitely get on
[22:35:21] <mycroftiv> but surely in the realm of technological possibility feeding carnivores vegetarian food is not harder than getting to the moon, probably
[22:35:30] <blkshp> I had a McPlant.
[22:35:31] <iryith> even if I pay extra I'm certainly willing to eat lab grown meat over natural
[22:35:34] <blkshp> IT was very nice.
[22:35:43] <arryana> i have exactly one vegetarian whose stance i respect.  she doesn't eat anything that dies for it.  as in, she can eat an apple because it doesn't hurt the tree.  but not a lettuce because the plant dies.
[22:35:49] <mycroftiv> i dont think this is a priority urgently, we have a lot more pressing problems to solve than feeding tigers tofu
[22:36:06] <mycroftiv> i dont advocate vegetarianism for others
[22:36:15] <arryana> i don't get the idea that we should have some 'moral
[22:36:24] <arryana> ' imperative that makes us unnatural
[22:36:31] <mycroftiv> i read bhagavad-gita and it made sense to me, and seems environmentally sound also, so its my choice. others do as they wish and i do not judge,
[22:36:49] <mycroftiv> i think morality and naturality are only tangentially related
[22:37:00] <mycroftiv> there are many 'natural' actions we (correctly) regard as immoral
[22:37:13] <mycroftiv> and we make many moral expecctations that are clearly an attempt to improve on nature
[22:37:15] <iryith> arryana, I somewhat agree, but I think with factory farming we've moved to a different level
[22:37:41] <mycroftiv> it is in our nature to use our minds to analyze our nature and behave differently and perhaps edit our own nature
[22:37:50] <arryana> i don't think factory farming is ideal either, there should be more of a balance.  but without cheap accessible food, people die.
[22:38:02] <mycroftiv> all humans should be fed and healthy
[22:38:05] <iryith> aye, this is certainly a discussion of the privileged
[22:38:12] * arryana nods
[22:38:22] <mycroftiv> i work in life to feed the hungry
[22:38:24] <arryana> i don't know a single poor vegetarian.  that's a choice only for the relatively wealthy
[22:38:41] <mycroftiv> i am connected to a housing coop that helps feed people
[22:38:55] <mycroftiv> i give money and work to help people have food as active effort in life
[22:39:02] <mycroftiv> and i do not expect or ask others to be vegetarian
[22:39:10] <iryith> why not
[22:39:18] <mycroftiv> i simply responded to questions about my own choices
[22:39:43] <mycroftiv> i hold myself to a totally different standard than i hold others because i can control my own choices and i have much greater awareness
[22:39:50] <mycroftiv> i trust others to make their own decisions for themselves
[22:39:52] <arryana> i'm not anti-vegetarian.  i just think it's unnatural.
[22:40:02] <mycroftiv> most things we do are unnatural
[22:40:05] <iryith> greater awareness of your own decisions and internal thoughts, or a greater awareness in general than other people?
[22:40:24] <mycroftiv> of my own thoughts
[22:40:31] <mycroftiv> other people knwo their own lives
[22:40:35] <mycroftiv> they decide for themselves
[22:40:47] <mycroftiv> and im not acting to change or control them , or tell them they are wrong
[22:41:12] <iryith> where are you from, mycroftiv, if you don't mind my asking
[22:41:15] <mycroftiv> i eat mostly vegetarian, and i work in life to help people have food by contribution to a food cooperative and other things
[22:41:19] <arryana> i'm probably just old.  my great uncle had a farm when i was a kid.  we knew the difference between the laying hens and milk cows which got names, and the frying hens and the beef cattle that didn't.
[22:41:21] <mycroftiv> wisconsin usa
[22:41:34] <mycroftiv> i live across from a farm
[22:41:43] <arryana> i find it hard to see things any other way.  but i'm evidently too rigid to change my thinking.
[22:41:50] <blkshp> I think my issue is im realising im getting a little older now and I eat meat for 2 meals of every day.
[22:42:01] <arryana> wow.
[22:42:10] <iryith> getting old is ass
[22:42:12] <blkshp> yeah
[22:42:16] <blkshp> and yeah
[22:42:18] <arryana> we eat meat maybe three days a week.  and fish one.
[22:42:25] <arryana> though that's not a hard and fast rule
[22:42:33] <arryana> i like getting old
[22:42:34] <arryana> at least so far
[22:42:35] <blkshp> I mean not just meat, but there's usually some meat.
[22:42:45] <arryana> maybe by 70 i'll change my mind
[22:42:45] <mycroftiv> i dont mind the old but i mind the bad health
[22:43:00] <iryith> completely off topic for a minute, but if you enjoy good piano and synth music, Sarah Coponat will start on twitch soon https://www.twitch.tv/sarahcoponat
[22:43:01] <ro-bot-o> [url] Twitch | www.twitch.tv
[22:43:01] <arryana> i know what you mean, blk
[22:43:18] <iryith> Is there a correlation of bad health in old age and meat eating?
[22:43:21] <arryana> it's more an issue of balance, for us.
[22:43:26] <iryith> That stance changes like every other month
[22:43:32] <mycroftiv> being vegetarian has probably hurt my health and thats why i have started eating fish, as i mentioned at the beginning of some ofthis
[22:43:40] <blkshp> I jut don't seem to feel like i;ve eaten properly unless there's been meat.
[22:43:45] <arryana> i also have strong feelings on how much we spend on food.
[22:44:11] <arryana> it isn't an issue of affording it, i just feel it's rather obscene to be profligate
[22:44:13] <mycroftiv> my rheumatoid arthritis has been worse than it was for my father and his sister who also have it, and this may be because meat is helpful for bone and joint health and my vegetarianism has made symptoms worse in life as ive aged
[22:44:14] <iryith> I knew a vegetarian back in the day that only ate oreos and french fries. They were always on a grand stand about how morally superior they were, but my god they were like ...grey and smelled of rotten eggs
[22:44:26] <arryana> haha
[22:44:36] <iryith> wonder what happened to them
[22:44:43] <arryana> today we had sausages, but it's sunday.
[22:45:15] <arryana> the totality of our food today was cereal for breakfast, sausages and baked potatoes for lunch, and my other half had soup for dinner.
[22:45:21] <arryana> tomato, i think
[22:45:51] <blkshp> I threw some bacon and mushrooms in a pan till cooked and poured 2 whisked eggs on top :D that was lunch
[22:45:54] <iryith> I had coffee for breakfast, peanut butter on bread for lunch, and I mustered the will to make a shitty meatloaf for dinner
[22:45:58] <iryith> now I'm drinking whisky
[22:46:08] <mycroftiv> its interesting how people seem to universalize choices, like Kant's categorical imperative is sort of assumed even if you try to say its not your perspective
[22:46:11] <arryana> yesterday we had leftover couscous salad made with chopped red pepper and avocado, kidney beans, chives, and lemon juice
[22:46:43] *** Joins: saufa (~saufa@m91-129-102-64.cust.tele2.ee)
[22:46:51] <mycroftiv> the idea that if you say 'i make this choice' it is intended as advocating that all other beings make the same choice - i think the idea that what is best is very human and situation dependent is often forgotten
[22:47:32] <mycroftiv> and determining the best course of action is always calculating this huge expression that depends on every variable that applies to the observer frame it is being calculated from
[22:47:32] <arryana> i have a hard and fast limit of $45 quid a week in food, and that includes household cleaners, shampoo/conditioner, personal grooming items, and alcohol.
[22:47:34] <iryith> you could make the argument that all humans are essentially the same sacks of meat with the same biological processes and have a set, near universal nutritional need that could be optimally met
[22:47:38] <arryana> also things like trash bags and such
[22:48:05] <arryana> haha
[22:48:07] <iryith> so personal choice shouldn't really count, it should be the optimization of our nutrition to meet our needs
[22:48:08] <mycroftiv> iryith: i think the biological commonality is clearly important, but it seems limitative to me and not prescriptive
[22:48:09] <arryana> not in my case, but i'm a freak.
[22:48:20] <mycroftiv> iryith: wait i lost a step there completely
[22:48:41] <arryana> porphyria has rather specific dietary requirements
[22:48:56] <mycroftiv> the idea that someone else should optimize my nutrition rather than myself, based on some criteria about what is 'best for me' that is not my choicece, seems way off my moral values
[22:49:23] <iryith> don't we do this for other aspects of our lives though?
[22:49:25] <mycroftiv> for instance it seems immoral to force people to have children if they do not wish, even though this may serve some purpose for society or well being etc
[22:49:36] <mycroftiv> iryith: im basically radical communitarian anarchist
[22:49:44] <iryith> take smoking and drinking. Those have been proven by science to be detrimental to our bodies, and thus we don't advocate for their usage
[22:49:48] <arryana> good luck forcing people to have kids.
[22:49:49] <iryith> shouldn't we do the same with nutrition?
[22:50:06] <mycroftiv> iryith : i advocate drinking and smoking as much as you want if you dont hurt others
[22:50:20] <mycroftiv> and not trying to control others choices
[22:50:23] <iryith> but it is objectively bad for your health, no matter who you are
[22:50:34] <iryith> thus it should be a moral imperative toward your fellow humans to make them stop
[22:50:36] <mycroftiv> maybe i enjoy the pleasure of the experience
[22:50:46] <mycroftiv> i completely and utterly disagree
[22:50:56] <blkshp> iryith: I disagree too.
[22:51:02] <iryith>  Why?
[22:51:06] <mycroftiv> pursuit of hedonistic pleasure without harm to others is of utmost moral importancee to preserve
[22:51:13] <blkshp> Provide information but don't annoy people about it
[22:51:18] <mycroftiv> regardless of self-harm, within only vaguely reasonable limits
[22:51:32] <mycroftiv> aka i dont think the guy who had someone kill him and eat him was OK
[22:51:45] <mycroftiv> we do draw the line SOMEWHERE on voluntary self-harm for pleasure
[22:51:48] <iryith> isn't it our moral imperative to help other people? This kind of goes back to the start of the conversation about helping others and having a moral projection toward other humans
[22:51:58] <iryith> mycroftiv, true
[22:51:59] <mycroftiv> helping people is about what THEY WANT
[22:52:04] <mycroftiv> not what we decide is best for them
[22:52:06] <blkshp> It's not help if they don't want it.
[22:52:13] <iryith> even if it's destructive for them, mycroftiv ?
[22:52:18] <blkshp> It's getting involved in something that isn't your business.
[22:52:21] <mycroftiv> within limits, yes
[22:52:23] <blkshp> and yes, even so.
[22:52:34] <blkshp> Do you tell people that skydive they shouldn't have that fun?
[22:52:39] <mycroftiv> because destructive vs constructive when it comes to life choices is far from easy
[22:52:43] <iryith> really going for the end-member here, but what about suicide?
[22:52:44] <blkshp> People that drive shouldn't because it's dangerous?
[22:52:54] <mycroftiv> and things like rock climbing and sky diving are a great example
[22:52:59] <iryith> should you help someone or encourage them to commit suicide if they believe it is the right course?
[22:53:05] <mycroftiv> iryith: i mostly support freedom to suicide
[22:53:16] <mycroftiv> i hope we can make the world a place where people enjoy life
[22:53:23] <blkshp> It is my opinion people should have a way to commit suicide if they want to but with regulations.
[22:53:25] <arryana> well, i'm going to hell on that one, as it were.
[22:53:28] <mycroftiv> which often means permitting hedonistic enjoyment
[22:53:49] <mycroftiv> nothing makes me think about killing myself more than the thought of a world where all fun was denied For My Own Good
[22:53:53] <arryana> my father chose to refuse feeding when he was terminal, and i was the one who refused on his behalf the last few days before he died
[22:54:02] <iryith> mycroftiv, do you consider yourself a libertarian then?
[22:54:08] <iryith> if you were to put yourself in a box
[22:54:10] <arryana> i suppose that's assisting suicide
[22:54:17] <blkshp> <3
[22:54:28] <mycroftiv> iryith: that label is associated with cringe communities so i have learned to dissasociate from it
[22:54:46] <iryith> understandable, but as for the ideals, would you put yourself in that category?
[22:54:49] <iryith> minus the edge-lords
[22:55:11] <mycroftiv> as for actual content of beliefs, i believe humans should be free to do what they want if they are just hurting themselves and not others, yea
[22:55:53] <iryith> how do you define "hurting themselves and not others"
[22:55:58] <mycroftiv> and especially given i lived through 80s war on drugs where 'lets kill people for smoking a joint or at least lock them up for life' was mainstream in my country
[22:56:08] <iryith> our actions in life are seldomly isolated to our own mind
[22:56:17] <arryana> i don't think anyone was suggesting killing people for weed
[22:56:27] * iryith hides the edibles
[22:56:27] <mycroftiv> arrayana: yes they were
[22:56:37] <arryana> i really don't believe that.
[22:56:46] <iryith> mycroftiv, I think every action we participate in has an impact on someone else
[22:56:55] <iryith> especially hedonistic pleasure
[22:57:13] <mycroftiv> sigh this is not an argument i want to dig up sources for, the extremeity of antidrug rhetoric by the usa right wing in the 1980s, but believe me, the reality is as bad as you can possibly imagine
[22:57:15] <iryith> look at any drug. The supply chain of any illegal substance is rife with death and tears
[22:57:32] <arryana> are you talking about trafficking or use?
[22:57:48] <iryith> I don't think those can be separated
[22:57:55] <mycroftiv> i advocate for taking psychedelics to understand reality better for philosophical purposes and the criminalization of drugs is criminizalization of thoughts
[22:58:02] <iryith> in order for you to use it (unless you grown your own), it has to be trafficked
[22:58:07] <iryith> growing your own weed, go nuts
[22:58:18] <blkshp> I still struggle with that fact that in this and other 1st world countries and others we prohibit euthanasia on humans yet, our pets have to be put down to prevent suffering. It's one of the main things i'd like to change in this world. Not saying that people can just choose one day but having no recourse or options at all astounds me.
[22:58:25] <iryith> things like LSD/molly/whatever are not something you can make on your own
[22:58:36] <iryith> blkshp, fully agree
[22:58:58] <arryana> also agreed, blkshp.  which is why i did what i did
[22:59:50] <mycroftiv> iryith: for me people like Owsley Stanley are heroes
[22:59:56] <blkshp> Absolutely, as I would have if i had have needed to.
[23:00:00] <arryana> i know my mother would go for assisted suicide if it were an option
[23:00:06] <mycroftiv> fighting on the side of truth and freedom against totalitarian oppression
[23:00:12] <arryana> she doesn't have my father's balls to stop the intake of nutrition
[23:01:09] <arryana> what about alcohol, iryith?
[23:01:22] <arryana> brew your own beer, or trafficking?
[23:01:38] <arryana> or is it different if there's a supported industry?
[23:01:47] * arryana has no idea where the lines are for this
[23:02:40] <iryith> I think the legitimacy of the alcohol industry allows for less suffering in the supply chain
[23:02:52] <arryana> hm
[23:03:02] <iryith> but one could also argue that due to that same legitimacy and peddling of it in media there is more suffering on the end on a population scale than with illicit drugs
[23:03:06] <mycroftiv> too bad alcohol has a lot of the worst outcomes of any widely used substance
[23:03:16] <blkshp> yep
[23:03:20] <mycroftiv> my life has been deeply affected by other people's alcoholism
[23:03:42] <mycroftiv> so the prices of libertarian tolerance are far from lost on me
[23:04:03] <mycroftiv> we tolerate unbelievable chronic alcoholic pathology and externalities from it
[23:04:34] <iryith> hell, alcoholism is even romanticized
[23:05:19] *** Joins: time-trav (~mzt@gateway/tor-sasl/mzt)
[23:05:53] <mycroftiv> but to me the world we really want is one where we care for each other and if people want to drink we just make sure to take the car keys away
[23:06:33] <iryith> the problem is not everyone is that empathetic
[23:07:01] <mycroftiv> well its hard because we all need help and being called on to help clean others messes isnt cool
[23:07:18] <mycroftiv> i have lived the life where my day is ruined trying to clean up a disaster caused by someone elses drinking the night before
[23:08:13] <mycroftiv> so the urge to make rules and Take the Bottle Away by force is understandable
[23:09:05] <mycroftiv> but prohibition is not widely regarded as a successful remedy
[23:10:18] <mycroftiv> and we are left with the messy compromises of Harm Reduction and trying to get along with balancing competing imperatives to Be Healthy and Encourage Health and not over regulate and start bashing peoples heads in for their backyard moonshine
[23:10:50] <iryith> then comes the ages old question of "where do you draw the line"?
[23:10:59] <mycroftiv> since you cant ignore the costs of coercive violent enforcecement which are always implied
[23:11:18] <mycroftiv> saying 'we should ban X' is never cost free, someone has to implement and enforce this using state monopoly on forcee
[23:12:16] <arryana> this is where i'm glad i'm old.
[23:12:50] <iryith> this is where I go into weapons manufacturing to make some sweet coin ;)
[23:13:34] <arryana> i should amend my statement about there only being one vegetarian i respect.  i have quite a few vegetarian/vegan friends and i don't actually personally give a crap what anyone else does or doesn't eat.  i just think it's a lot less simple than 'i don't eat animals so i'm doing no harm', as if plants aren't also alive, among other things.
[23:13:52] <arryana> i also don't give a crap if anyone else drinks, takes drugs, skydives, or anything else.

[23:14:45] <iryith> just because someone makes a personal choice that makes them feel as a hero in their own story doesn't mean I can't judge them negatively on my side
[23:15:03] <arryana> the same way i think everyone has a right to vote for any idiot they want to, even if i think a different idiot is a better choice.
[23:15:15] <iryith> meh, I'm not a big fan of the overarching judgy god type characters

[23:15:45] <mycroftiv> myself neither, im a scientific rationalist, i was just pointing to what a well known text on vegetarian philosophysays

[23:17:05] <arryana> i have no problem with the hasidics if they want to wear wool.  but i'm not going to.
[23:17:09] <mycroftiv> but i want to know what those words are and how they have affected the world and what they mean to the people who do follow them
[23:17:15] <arryana> that hasn't been a sin for thirty years or more
[23:17:35] <arryana> but no, i don't think there's any sky-father waiting to smite people who have a steak on friday
[23:17:36] <iryith> mycroftiv, so basically a buffet of tenets that you pick to put on your plate of your own personal philosophy?
[23:18:01] <iryith> that sounded more condescending than I wanted
[23:18:11] <mycroftiv> iryith: my own beliefs are peer-reviewed science and mathematics, plus my own belief in harmony in music and ultrafilters and infinite self-similar branching
[23:18:29] <mycroftiv> which are not contrary to peer reviewed science, just my own metaphors
[23:18:34] <iryith> those two things are nearly mutually exclusive
[23:18:38] <mycroftiv> no
[23:18:46] <mycroftiv> not whatsoever
[23:18:55] <mycroftiv> believing that there is a kind of metaphorical harmony of the universe
[23:19:09] <iryith> I don't think you can be a scientific rationalist and also believe in a universal harmony
[23:19:11] <mycroftiv> is a philosophical belief NOT in contradiction to belief in peer reviewed science and math
[23:19:19] <mycroftiv> you certainly absolutely can
[23:19:27] <iryith> you can, it's just not an internally consistent structure
[23:19:35] <mycroftiv> find the inconsistency please
[23:19:49] <iryith> what scientific proof is there of a universal harmony
[23:19:50] <mycroftiv> i do formal logic in agda at great and undending length to try to make all this precise

[23:19:58] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abstract 34 | vlepy.github.io
[23:20:02] <iryith> that's basically the same as saying astrology is a law
[23:20:16] <mycroftiv> iryith: i did NOT claim that science proves the existence of any such harmony
[23:20:26] <mycroftiv> do you know the axiom of choice in mathematics?
[23:20:41] <mycroftiv> it is a commonly used principle in mathematical reasoning
[23:20:42] <iryith> but you saying that you are a scientific rationalist leads to that conclusion
[23:20:53] <mycroftiv> no i did not make that claim
[23:21:12] <mycroftiv> i said i believe in peer reviewed science, plus my own metaphors which are not in conflict with peer reviewed science
[23:21:17] <iryith> you said "i'm a scientific rationalist"
[23:21:20] <mycroftiv> i am
[23:21:23] <arryana> i can see the argument that the universe strives for balance, but not harmony
[23:21:24] <iryith> I..what
[23:21:34] <iryith> I might be misunderstanding you
[23:21:38] <mycroftiv> yes i think so
[23:21:52] <mycroftiv> thats why im able to break down exactly what any confusion is, if we go step by step
[23:21:57] <iryith> ok

[23:23:31] <mycroftiv> there are beliefs which one can hold about the world which are not in contradiction to science, but which are also not scientifically confirmed, and if you distinguish these things (the metaphorical-philosophical from the evidentiary facts)
[23:23:45] <mycroftiv> you are still within the framework of rationalist scientific belief
[23:24:18] <iryith> I think I have a problem with that though
[23:24:35] <mycroftiv> as a very simple example, believing that it is possible, and in fact likely, that we will one day communicate with extraterrestrials - not anti-scientific!
[23:24:53] <mycroftiv> believing that extraterrestrials are beaming stuff into your brain RIGHT NOW - crazy and totally different
[23:25:07] <iryith> because it means you can ascribe any overarching philosophy to your life and then choose something that may be contradictory to some of that umbrella but then it is just given a lesser or external place

[23:25:25] <mycroftiv> no, everything has to be consistent
[23:25:30] <mycroftiv> no loopholes or local exceptions
[23:25:40] <iryith> universal harmony is not consistent with scientific rationalism
[23:25:56] <mycroftiv> what do you take 'universal harmony' to mean?>
[23:26:01] <mycroftiv> that must be the misunderstanding
[23:26:26] <mycroftiv> do you believe a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the naturals exists by the axioms of ZFC?
[23:26:42] <iryith> At least in what I have been exposed to it is the concept of a person having a 'connection' with the universe as a whole, whether that be through 'vibrations' or universal frequencies or even planetary alignments
[23:26:56] <arryana> i think this is all a bit more than i can engage in without losing count of stitches.
[23:27:02] <mycroftiv> i dont believe any astrology nonsense
[23:27:04] <iryith> I don't know what those are, mycroftiv
[23:27:09] <mycroftiv> i beleive in mathematical structure
[23:27:54] <mycroftiv> and that the observed mathematical structure of the universe makes use of the same mathematical principles that describe the mathematics of musical harmony and we can see this by running computer programs
[23:27:58] <iryith> can mathematical structure be a belief system?
[23:28:15] <mycroftiv> believing the world follows mathematical rules is, yes
[23:28:41] <iryith> "the world" as in physics yes. People...not sure about that one
[23:29:34] <mycroftiv> musical harmony is constructed from simple arithmetic ratios, atomic orbitals and molecular structure have different arithmetic-ratio construction aspects, it is not antiscientific to note how the mathematical idea of 'ratio' is in both places
[23:29:38] <mycroftiv> this is what Pythagoras did
[23:29:52] <mycroftiv> except pythagoras didnt know about actual atoms and stuff of course
[23:30:14] <iryith> This can be argued against by looking at the different musical structures of different cultures
[23:30:26] <iryith> "western" music vs. chinese music, for example
[23:30:28] <mycroftiv> actually it can be argued FOR on that basis
[23:30:33] <iryith> completely different progressions
[23:30:47] <mycroftiv> not totally different underlying arithemtical tuning structures
[23:30:57] <mycroftiv> i went to college for music theory, this has been my life
[23:31:00] <iryith> completely different chord constructions, sure
[23:31:11] <iryith> not only the chord constructions but also progression
[23:31:11] <mycroftiv> the mathematical structure of music and how we understand it
[23:31:44] <mycroftiv> there is no contradiction here
[23:31:49] <mycroftiv> this is exactly what im saying
[23:32:05] <iryith> musical harmony is not objective though, it's culturally subjective
[23:32:10] <mycroftiv> we have a mathematical framework in which there is a universe of meaningful possible models with a variety of ways of embodying the structural aspects
[23:32:40] <mycroftiv> iryith: have you studied indian classical music, ragas and such?
[23:33:01] <mycroftiv> and compared how their harmonic structures and tunings compare with western scales and temperaments?
[23:33:06] <iryith> one doesn't need to study differing musical modes to know that there are major cultural subjectivities
[23:33:17] <mycroftiv> this is what i have studied and why i believe in these mathematical connections
[23:33:23] <mycroftiv> of course there are cultural subjectivities
[23:33:27] <iryith> I'm a classically trained musician, however
[23:33:34] <iryith> but only in western styles
[23:33:34] <mycroftiv> studying and understanding those precisely is my lifes work
[23:33:55] <mycroftiv> how the mathematical structures of musical possibility are reflected in the amazing variety of music people make
[23:34:27] <mycroftiv> and apart from deliberately avant garde stuff almost everyone hates, there are common simple mathematical aspects to all human music based on simple arithemtical ratios and repetition at multiple time scales
[23:34:49] <iryith> I always have this in the back of my head with these things: Author writes: "The curtains were blue."
[23:34:49] <iryith> Lit teacher says: "This reflects on the generally depressed state of the protagonist."
[23:34:49] <iryith> Author meant: "The curtains were blue."
[23:36:04] <mycroftiv> humans make sounds for music that sound good to them. these are sounds with mathematical structure we call 'rhythm' and 'pitch' and music theory is the study of why people like some things and not others
[23:36:20] <mycroftiv> which ties into all kinds of human cultural history
[23:36:41] <mycroftiv> like the 'blue note' as flat 7th in blues/jazz in relation to african cultural heritageand musical practices for instance
[23:37:05] <iryith> I don't think you can separate the nature/nurture out of that. It's like you get a brit and an aussie together and ask them which is better, Marmite or Vegemite, and you'll get WWIII in 2 minutes
[23:37:13] <mycroftiv> but its cultural and human subjectivity interacting with the mathematical realities of acoustics and physical perception
[23:37:18] <iryith> cultural upbringing and indoctrination is a powerful, powerful influencer
[23:37:41] <mycroftiv> yes but that still doesnt mean 12 tone static atonal jazz will ever take over the airwaves
[23:37:55] <iryith> it lights some people's fires
[23:37:57] <mycroftiv> steady rhythmic pulse and overtone based melodic structures will always be what most people enjoy
[23:38:01] <mycroftiv> yeah i love it myself
[23:38:11] <mycroftiv> i love it when the grateful dead play noise meltdown
[23:38:26] <mycroftiv> crazed atonal freejazz? played it, loved it
[23:38:47] <iryith> I've played it, and I hate it :D
[23:38:53] <mycroftiv> but the perfect fifth and 4/4 time are still more natural and emotionally expressive
[23:38:57] <mycroftiv> so you feel it yourself
[23:39:11] <mycroftiv> nicholas slonimsky tried training his daughter
[23:39:24] <mycroftiv> hed play atonal piano chords when giving her the bottle as an infant
[23:39:27] *** Quits: hlauk (~hlauk@176.33.97.244) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:39:41] <mycroftiv> to try to make her love music without chords and rhythm
[23:39:52] <mycroftiv> she did not become an atonal composer ;)
[23:40:39] <mycroftiv> the fact that which particular variety of sounds is nice to hear is like what food is nice to eat
[23:40:46] <mycroftiv> no culture has decided to eat broken glass
[23:41:14] <mycroftiv> the huge variety of foods doesnt make the idea of delicious and nutritious food totally subjective and without substance
[23:41:20] <mycroftiv> it makes it rich and fascinating to study
[23:41:43] <mycroftiv> same with music and mathematics and how the universe is put together, i think
[23:43:14] <iryith> I mainly disagree, but I see where you're coming from
[23:43:24] <mycroftiv> yea lets get back to something specific
[23:43:35] <mycroftiv> whether im being anti-scientific or inconsistent in my beliefs
[23:44:10] <mycroftiv> that i can believe in peer reviewed science and math, but also in the philosophical idea that the universe is mathematically harmonious
[23:44:29] <mycroftiv> and that this is *actionable information* in some way even
[23:46:08] <iryith> I'm beginning to think that there's no way you can have an internally consistent philosophical framework
[23:46:12] <iryith> humans are irrational anyway
[23:46:34] <mycroftiv> well, if you can find the inconsistency in anything i say, im very interested
[23:47:11] <mycroftiv> mathematical formalisms can be proved inconsistent but only proved consistent by using a stronger system
[23:47:39] <mycroftiv> ive literally spent my life trying to make what i say mathematically precise
[23:48:17] <mycroftiv> the ideas im speaking about now are from the early 1990s and http://harmonicultrafilter.com/m/music-index.html is lifes work trying to make the philosophy meaningful
[23:48:17] <ro-bot-o> [url] Harmonic Ultrafilter Music | harmonicultrafilter.com
[23:48:58] <mycroftiv> since most people arent that into philosophy, ive made music and computer code and writing and formal mathematics to try to communicate the philosophical idea precisely
[23:52:17] <mycroftiv> so you can play an interactive fiction game where a machine explains philosophy of set theory of the infinite, the same math as in all the agda code, and the same abstract structure as the plan 9 namespaces, and musical structure of the 20 years of leitmotiv transformation
[23:53:09] <mycroftiv> and hopefully have an idea for how to shape your own story into the story you hope to be living and sharing with everyone else's stories
[23:56:37] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:57:29] <iryith> I'll have to look into it
[23:58:06] <causative_> someday I want to make an elenchus argument-diagramming app, when I find the time.  Two people talk using the app and it helps them to easily diagram their statements and how they relate to each other, and show unanswered questions
[23:58:13] <mycroftiv> eh, just my take on things ya know, nice to be in a placee where philosophy is welcomed
[23:58:16] <causative_> when I find the time
[23:58:22] <mycroftiv> causative_: sounds magnificent
[23:58:31] <causative_> other programming projects are competing for my attention
[23:58:33] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[23:58:35] <causative_> and other philosophy projects
[23:58:41] <mycroftiv> id love to have something that reflects conversation into definitions and connections like that
