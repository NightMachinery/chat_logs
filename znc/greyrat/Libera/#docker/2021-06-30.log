If I am faced with a docker setup on the linux host with btrfs filesystem, and a path like btrfs/subvolumes/2068a0725626b011019dc8ef529f169764394f7974d18adacd3d1c0bf211a856/usr/lib/inkscape/libinkscape_base.so - how can I figure out, which image, container or volume this corresponds to?

[03:42:53] <Lutin> akik yap
[03:43:07] <akik> Lutin: swarm doesn't support capabilities last time i checked
[03:43:28] <Lutin> akik which capabillities ?
[03:43:42] <akik> any i think. i'll try to find the info
[03:43:45] <blaklistd> Lutin: yay it worked

[03:44:09] <Lutin> blaklistd yap nice! Much better tehen traefik
[03:44:13] <Lutin> *then
[03:44:21] <akik>     Note when using docker stack deploy
[03:44:22] <akik>     The cap_add and cap_drop options are ignored when deploying a stack in swarm mode
[03:44:23] <Lutin> akik any ? 
[03:44:32] <blaklistd> but can this also proxy non docker apps?
[03:44:32] <Lutin> oh for that!
[03:44:32] <akik> that's from here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/
[03:44:59] <Lutin> akik yes it seems so but when I deploy the stack as root, no issue
[03:45:14] <Lutin> I think portainer wasn't doing it as root, I read people had issues with that as well
[03:45:28] <Lutin> akik good one, thanks!
[03:45:32] <blaklistd> i have to look into portainer 
[03:45:40] <akik> Lutin: you can check in the container which capabilities it has
[03:45:49] <Lutin> I can sec
[03:45:59] <akik> capsh --print
[03:46:57] <akik> i meant changing the capabilities, not having them at all

[03:48:17] <akik> Lutin: not any tui kind of thing
[03:48:47] <Lutin> akik ok... I need some lazy thing... portainer is nice but not nice enough when you do cli
[03:48:56] <Lutin> but inspect is not always a thing

[20:39:08] <Lutin> is it try that an internal network does not even allow routing through a container to another network ? it's that isolated ? But how ?
[20:41:23] <programmerq> Lutin when a network is created with the --internal flag, it simply doesn't have a working gateway, so any containers on that network can only contact other containers on the same network.
[20:41:53] <programmerq> there is a gateway in the route, but docker simply doesn't actually set up any forwarding rules for that gateway ip, so the packets end up having nowhere to go
[20:41:53] <Lutin> programmerq aha! because it still has a GW it seems but doesn't work!
[20:42:00] <Lutin> indeed :)

[20:56:52] <programmerq> EXPOSE is just metadata. If your container is actually publishing a port at runtime, then docker-proxy will listen on the host. If your process is listening inside a container, then it'll be listening on the container. tcp6 really means ipv4 and/or ipv6 due to how the tcp6 socket is implemented in the linux kernel.
[20:57:39] *** Joins: candyman (~candyman@user/candyman)
[20:59:04] <programmerq> for example, on a linux host you can fire up 'socat - tcp6-listen:8999,fork,reuseaddr' in one terminal. 'netstat -nlp | grep socat' will show 'tcp6       0      0 :::8999                 :::*                    LISTEN      2112/socat' but you can connect to 8999 on any address on that host-- 127.0.0.1, the eth0 ipv4 interface, any ipv6 interface, etc...
[20:59:34] <programmerq> some programs that are configured to listen on all interfaces use that tcp6 interface so it'll be all interfaces for ipv4 and ipv6

[22:32:47] <programmerq> you can 'docker service update --force' on some services and those specific services will get new tasks that'll get scheduled on the unloaded node.
[22:33:38] <programmerq> swarm doesn't do it for you because any time swarm kills a task, that's a possible interruption, depending on how the service in question was implemented.
[22:35:22] <Lutin> yes that is what I read as well. So... something for in the books :)
[22:35:26] <Lutin> thanks programmerq :)
[22:38:04] <Lutin> programmerq where does a overlay attached local container get "some extra" ethX from and also some subnet which I can't place ? I would think there is no need for it as well

[22:43:03] <Lutin> yeah it's own bridge
[22:43:28] <Lutin> can we avoid that ?
[22:45:39] <programmerq> that's the gwbridge network for egress.
[22:46:06] <programmerq> let me take a look

[22:46:24] <programmerq> I feel like there's a way to turn that off, but I'm not certain.
[22:46:52] <Lutin> yeah would be nice because I think it needs it to be able to do anything at all to the outside world if needed your "standard network overlay whatever" won't help there I would say
[22:47:17] <Lutin> programmerq let me know when it pops up, I would like to know... curious :)
[22:47:37] <programmerq> create the network like this: docker network create -d overlay --internal --attachable mynet
[22:47:46] <programmerq> then it won't attach it to the gwbridge network
[22:48:11] <programmerq> so containers that would be attached to that overlay network would need a second network if you want some other way to route out.
[22:48:52] <programmerq> that gives the effect of the attached container only has a route for the subnet of the overlay, but no default gateway
[22:49:17] <Lutin> programmerq true I tried that with wireguard but then you can't route to that subnet when you attach wireguard to it
[22:49:33] <Lutin> without the --internal you can
[22:49:43] <Lutin> because you need that non-working GW :)
[22:49:56] <programmerq> yup, you'd have to deal with other ways to route with your wireguard thing. overlay networks were never designed to be a routed network-- they were only ever meant to pass container-to-container traffic
[22:50:17] <Lutin> yap but without --internal it works :)
[22:50:20] <programmerq> that's why there's that automatic gwbridge network so traffic has a way to egress directly on the node.
[22:50:31] <Lutin> yes indeed!
[22:50:52] <programmerq> so if you want your wireguard container to be on that overlay and have an egress, attach it to two networks.
[22:50:58] <Lutin> ingress is only incoming traffic I woud say ? It floats out over a node
[22:50:58] <programmerq> one for egress and then the internal overlay
[22:51:06] <programmerq> gwbridge is for egress
