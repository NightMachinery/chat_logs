[00:26:17] <ButterNoodle> well it is arch for noobs...
[00:26:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The security issues are a lot more critical.
[00:26:53] <ButterNoodle> and they cant manage a simple task of unfucking their dependency tree so u can properly update

[01:23:27] <Roey> bco1981: ahhh nice :)
[01:23:59] <Roey> I had a 486 dx/2 66 Mhz, with 16 MB RAM.  It was my baby, back in 1993, when I was 13
[01:24:00] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:24:28] <Roey> before that, I had had a 286 w/ 1 MB RAM and a monochrome monitor, and a 40MB HD, from 1988 to about 1993
[01:24:43] <Bco1981> wow
[01:24:55] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, in January I will have 800 euro to spend on a graphic card! But I won't spend it all cause I'm not that dumb
[01:25:12] <Roey> and only once I went to college did I get a new computer, a k6-2/300 with.. 16 or 32 MB RAM, not sure.  Back in like 1998.  That was the one I entered college with.
[01:25:33] <Bco1981> Roey: well 5 years isn't uncommon between upgrades, even today
[01:25:34] <Roey> \o/ yeay Cryowolf :)
[01:25:40] <Roey> aye
[01:25:50] <Roey> bco1981: well so the computer I have now, it's from 2015
[01:25:53] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: nice, i hope you can get one, not too pricy
[01:26:11] <Roey> I have SSD drives (SATA, though this supports NVME too)
[01:26:28] <Roey> Cryowolf: I put in an nvidia 2060 rtx in it.
[01:26:29] <Roey> er
[01:26:36] <Roey> bco1981: ^
[01:26:56] <Roey> oh gosh this is so boring
[01:26:57] <Bco1981> sata ssd isn't bad, there isn't much to gain by going with nvme, unless you have extremly big files to copy.
[01:27:05] <Roey> well,
[01:27:12] <Roey> the motherboard is an asus x99
[01:27:17] <Roey> it has an nvme slot
[01:27:49] <Bco1981> a 250-500gb nvme and use that for OS drive
[01:27:50] <Roey> I keep wantin g to splurge nad spend lke 800 on a 4 TB or better yet, 8 TB NVME SSD
[01:28:09] <Bco1981> they are too expensive right now...
[01:28:11] <Roey> bco1981: I don't mind spending money to get a 2TB or 4TB nvme
[01:28:22] <Bco1981> i do have a few 4tb nvme and sata ssd
[01:28:37] <Bco1981> but the price difference on 2->4tb is just too much.
[01:28:41] <Roey> bco1981: yeah it's expensive now, and like you imply, I can wait for now :)
[01:29:28] <Roey> I have  ideas.  I want to get a Galaxy Tab S6 (or whatever the latest is), and also a laptop
[01:29:37] <Roey> so.  Many thousands of dollars in the future.
[01:29:56] <Roey> oh, plus this SSD
[01:30:00] <Bco1981> add a 1tb sdcard in that tablet ;)
[01:30:07] <Roey> :) yeah
[01:30:27] <Roey> oh, why /1/ TB when we can put in /**2**/ TB?!?!!!!!
[01:30:34] <Roey> but yeah.
[01:30:39] <Bco1981> there are 2tb available ?
[01:31:13] <Roey> and the laptop, every time I configure a laptop online, it always ends up being this zombie tank monstrosity that costs $3000
[01:31:27] <Cryowolf> Roey, me too. I've added telegram channels that source 3060ti, 3070, 3070ti
[01:31:35] <Cryowolf> and 6600xt, 6700, 6700xt, 6800
[01:31:39] <Roey> bco1981, I dunno if a 2TB option on a tablet is available.  I didn't know that they even give 1 TB as an option on those tablets!
[01:32:07] <Roey> Cryowolf: do you know anythinhg about the upcoming intel video cards?
[01:32:08] <Bco1981> Roey: i would just buy one myself and put in it after.
[01:32:22] <Roey> bco1981: ah
[01:32:24] <Roey> gotcha
[01:32:59] <Bco1981> because... i had the same thougt, getting the latest and greatest samsung tablet. and then add the sdcard.
[01:33:05] <Bco1981> thought*
[01:33:07] <Cryowolf> Roey, yeah but I hear they're first aiming to release alternatives to weaker cards
[01:33:10] <Cryowolf> like 1050 etc
[01:33:31] <Cryowolf> but provide them cheaper, with less power draw, less heat
[01:33:36] <Roey> ohhhh I didn't know that, okay
[01:33:54] <Cryowolf> they have one such theyve shown around
[01:33:57] <Cryowolf> not sure about all of em
[01:34:04] <Roey> their highest-performing card would compete with what, Nvidia 3060 RTX?
[01:34:19] <Bco1981> in that range they say.
[01:34:30] <Roey> I'll be so happy to plunk my oney on that.
[01:34:36] <Roey> because of the driver issue.
[01:34:37] <Cryowolf> ok Roey, youre right
[01:34:38] <Roey> primarily.
[01:34:39] <Cryowolf> they added more info
[01:34:40] <Cryowolf> new ones
[01:34:58] <Roey> oh?
[01:35:31] <Cryowolf> they will release them q1 2022
[01:35:50] <Cryowolf> they shown some supersamplnig on 4k
[01:37:10] <Bco1981> rumors and leaked tests sure make it look like they really are competitive.

[13:00:48] <DaPinkOne> basically, somebody with money came in and tried to claim ownership. the staff wasn't having it, but they lacked the funding to put up a real fight, so they left and came over here.
[13:01:13] <segen> dang that sucks
[13:01:37] <DaPinkOne> indeed. it was quite the drama to watch go down
[13:01:50] <segen> i was gonna join my channels i go on and they were all dead
[13:02:18] <segen> and someone pointed me to this 
[13:02:23] <DaPinkOne> various communities split between here and one other server(I forget what it's called, it's where most of the linux distros went)

[13:03:23] <DaPinkOne> a lot of communities were kindof on the fence for a while, but the usurper pretty much made the decision for them, when he forcibly took over or removed channels en masse
[13:04:36] <DaPinkOne> it really is the end of an era; it's a real shame that happened.
[13:05:25] <segen> ya that sucks a big one
[13:06:10] <segen> good thing i refound this channel
[13:07:09] <segen> jst sucks that lots of people are moving to discord :( 
[13:07:41] <DaPinkOne> eh, some have, some haven't. I heard a lot of people talking about matrix for a bit
[13:07:51] <DaPinkOne> I'm not sure what the FOSS guys decided on
[13:08:23] <segen> i tried matrix and it wasnt that great
[13:09:10] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: I don't nearly use IRC as much as I used to
[13:09:30] <Bco1981> What's all the FOSS about?
[13:09:40] <DaPinkOne> Bco1981, clever jokes
[13:09:50] <KatrinValerie> Kinda fuzzy
[13:10:00] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, I don't think any of us do. I'm not around as much, just 'cause i'm older and i'm busy

[13:10:07] <Bco1981> i'm allowed to.
[13:10:13] <segen> that thing that really sucks it that jabber is dead
[13:10:16] <DaPinkOne> Bco1981, very punny
[13:11:09] <segen> i run irc all the time, kills my phone really fast tho
[13:11:39] <DaPinkOne> looks like the FSF did decide to come over here
[13:11:51] <KatrinValerie> segen: get a bouncer, that way you don't have to be online all the time
[13:12:25] <segen> i really need to lol
[13:12:31] <DaPinkOne> i've got a bouncer on my home lab system, so I don't have to keep the client up all the time on my phone or pc
[13:12:44] <DaPinkOne> a raspberry pi or something's plenty strong enough
[13:12:55] <KatrinValerie> meanwhile, I have a free vps sitting around that I could use for a bouncer but I don't because idk why
[13:13:00] <segen> im just to lazy to set one up
[13:13:11] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: Lazy
[13:13:12] <KatrinValerie> that's what I tell myself too
[13:13:34] <segen> lol
[13:13:34] <DaPinkOne> for a while, pre-bouncer, I just used irssi inside of screen via ssh
[13:13:36] <Bco1981> it's not that hard. even i could do it.
[13:13:38] <KatrinValerie> but in reality it's just my crippling depression and my inability to do things extends to every aspect of my life :D

[13:14:27] <segen> is irssi any good?
[13:14:36] <Bco1981> segen: works fine. i use it.
[13:14:40] <DaPinkOne> segen, I enjoyed it for a time, but it has a steep learning curve
[13:14:41] <KatrinValerie> The cool kids switched to weechat
[13:14:58] <DaPinkOne> atleast when compared to a gui client like hexchat
[13:15:12] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: maybe, idk. there are things i should get done. but haven't done for the last 6 months or so.
[13:15:21] <segen> i use weechat and its getting boring to use
[13:15:21] <KatrinValerie> first time I used IRC was on windows 95 with mirc or something
[13:16:15] <DaPinkOne> mirc was very popular in my early days. I think I started around '03ish though
[13:16:23] <segen> i think the first irc i used was on my dads pc in the 80's or 90's
[13:16:33] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: well that is probably just procrastination and we all do that to an extent, I hope those matters aren't all that important
[13:16:54] <KatrinValerie> Good grief I started out earlier than the pink one
[13:17:03] <KatrinValerie> but I wasn't on freenode for a long long time
[13:17:26] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: a new toilet seat. the one i have now is kinda broken with some ductape on. but it works. i got a new one as a present. but haven't switched it.
[13:17:27] <KatrinValerie> not with my regular nick anyways
[13:17:43] <KatrinValerie> I used to connect to freenode without an account a lot back in the days
[13:17:45] <DaPinkOne> I don't have logs from that far back, but I wasn't on freenode for several years. I was on a much smaller political network.
[13:17:58] <KatrinValerie> and I may have had an account on an old e-mail address but idk
[13:18:08] <segen> ben on jabber longer then irc, then the dreamcast cameout and i started using irc when i got the web disc working lol
[13:18:18] <KatrinValerie> I think I joined Freenode because of Debian

[13:20:13] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, I do log, but not publically, and the logs from way back then have long since been lost. I just happen to have email correspondence about them, dating from then
[13:20:27] <segen> i used to take photos of the chats when i was in my teens

[13:23:16] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, if you find a solution to this executive disfunction thing, let me know
[13:23:55] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: CBT and maybe the right meds, depending on the underlying condition
[13:24:02] <KatrinValerie> also not having a shit life helps
[13:24:09] <DaPinkOne> :(
[13:24:20] <segen> amigojapan: it was using a web version of a irc clint,saga used to host the website and servers long a go
[13:24:34] <KatrinValerie> financial stability is a core factor for being able to maintain mental stability
[13:24:39] <KatrinValerie> in this society at least
[13:24:45] <DaPinkOne> it really does help
[13:24:50] <amigojapan> I see segen 
[13:25:05] <segen> lasted a long time too
[13:25:14] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: it can, but it depends on circumstances, do you get the right med, right therpist, tackle the right issues in the right way?
[13:25:50] <KatrinValerie> Mental health stuff is sometimes difficult to figure out and sometimes pretty obvious.
[13:25:56] <DaPinkOne> my doc is more concerned with me not being in his office, than discussing issues. I've got a maybe-referral for a therapist sometime this year
[13:26:59] <segen> had so many good memories from it. used to get people to join us on pso and some other games
[13:27:24] <DaPinkOne> segen, I didn't know dreamcast could actually run stuff like that
[13:27:44] <DaPinkOne> it's a shame it didn't really take off
[13:27:45] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: alternatively burry yourself in work that you enjoy and let others take care of you somehow lol
[13:28:17] <amigojapan> segen: when you say "taking pictures"do you mean using a film camera or a digital camera?
[13:28:33] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, my current strategy is to stop trying to better myself, and resort to old coping strategies. it's less stressful, but my grades are better
[13:28:38] <segen> amigojapan: ya dreamcast had a webbrowser you could use and a keyboard and mouse
[13:29:20] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, I assumed he meant by cell phone, but since it was the era of the dreamcast, ...I guess that wasn't an option yet
[13:29:21] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: I have no idea what that would mean for you, but it somehow sounds like you consider your coping mechanism as bad
[13:29:41] <segen> amigojapan: file camera
[13:30:13] <amigojapan> segen: what do you mean by file camera?
[13:30:23] <DaPinkOne> eh, caffeine abuse, skipping out all non-class-related activities including higiene, etc 
[13:30:31] <DaPinkOne> it's pretty obviously not great

[14:25:01] <JesseDesu> i'm sure they dont pick laser corrected vision people
[14:25:05] <JesseDesu> still
[14:25:11] <JesseDesu> maybe they relaxed it
[14:25:44] <DaPinkOne> for pilots, probably not, but I knew a few people who wore glasses and/or got laser surgery that worked on the planes

[14:29:05] <JesseDesu> over a hundred years to make airplanes safe
[14:29:12] <JesseDesu> and cars have been around longer
[14:29:16] <DaPinkOne> eh, the AF is only from 1947 iirc. I'm not sure when the army air corp happened. I don't count the air force balloonists. that shit isn't real
[14:29:24] <JesseDesu> so logically, cars should be just as safe
[14:30:01] <JesseDesu> everytime i fly i think of it that way
[14:30:06] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, the reason planes are so much safer than cars is because they move in 3d. there's just nothing up there most of the time. cars are in 2d, and they're surrounded by obstacles
[14:30:18] <JesseDesu> "airplanes have been around 90% as long as cars"
[14:30:42] <DaPinkOne> the most dangerous place for a plane is near the airport
[14:30:50] <JesseDesu> well by that logic, motorcycles are safer cuz nothing is in front of them most of the time if you lane split
[14:31:20] <JesseDesu> and i believe the airplane logic applied to motorcycle safety logic
[14:31:26] <JesseDesu> applies
[14:31:35] <DaPinkOne> no, if you lane split, you're surrounded by more obstacles, which are moving faster relative to you, with closer tolerances
[14:31:39] <DaPinkOne> that's way worse
[14:31:51] <JesseDesu> theres also the extra training logic
[14:32:09] <JesseDesu> all pilots are rigorously trained
[14:32:23] <DaPinkOne> we're talking about the vehicle themselves. I presume perfect pilot/driver behavior

[14:32:49] <JesseDesu> the relation of the logic isnt perfectly in sync but its similar
[14:33:09] <DaPinkOne> in the case of non-perfect behavior, I suppose planes have a lot more failsafes, because you can't just pull over if your CAS system goes out
[14:33:13] <JesseDesu> i feel safe when i have more room to wiggle around in my lane
[14:33:45] <JesseDesu> i dont know what a CAS is other than close air support which i dont think you're using in this context

[14:36:09] <JesseDesu> how does it know
[14:36:16] <JesseDesu> from an accident
[14:36:23] <JesseDesu> or if you're really trying to push it
[14:37:06] <DaPinkOne> it puts limitations on what you're allowed to do
[14:38:00] <DaPinkOne> it's a complex system, and it's been a few years. I forget the details

[14:38:43] <DaPinkOne> it decides what your limitations are  based on wind speed

[15:22:31] <DunceCotus> complicated magic involved
[15:23:03] <DaPinkOne> DunceCotus, depends why it's dripping, but if you're talking about the faucet, it shouldn't be too hard to fix
[15:23:08] <DunceCotus> when it comes to pipelines and wiring, there's some bizarre metaphysics there I think
[15:23:19] <Surreal> The 9 in Numerology acts as an usher in this process of transition or transformation, guiding and empowering us with its wisdom. It absorbs answers from a spiritual source, then delivers them to us in the real world. This number is a humanitarian at heart

[15:23:57] <DaPinkOne> DunceCotus, there actually is some crazy science for pipes, like avoiding water hammers, fluid dynamics dictating the slope/diameter of pipes, etc
[15:24:20] <DunceCotus> its the sort of thing you just want to work with no issues
[15:24:33] <DunceCotus> its only when there's an issue where you become (painfully) aware of all this stuff
[15:24:38] <DaPinkOne> it's less an issue for supply lines, and more an issue for drainage, 'cause you need gravity to do all the work

[18:14:07] <MootPoot> just for fps
[18:14:18] <MootPoot> there are a few video glitches with it
[18:15:25] <MootPoot> full anime ep to 4k is like 5-6 hours
[18:15:28] <MootPoot> on my 5900x
[18:15:30] <MootPoot> damn
[18:15:30] <Bco1981> ai enhance 480p to 1080, then again 1080 to 4k...
[18:15:45] <MootPoot> I guess save it for only the stuff you love
[18:15:47] <Bco1981> 4k60fps
[18:16:10] <MootPoot> tbh what I'd do is use video AI for 1080->4k then SVP for 60fps

[21:22:37] <Matt|home> eh i won't say anymore

[21:22:58] <MootPoot> just turn your big brain off and little brain on
[21:23:11] <Matt|home> _i_ wanted something cool and thought provoking. like you know how in the first matrix the writers wanted to have it be about a neural network instead of the stupid fucking battery farm?
[21:23:21] <Matt|home> i was HOPING the new one would do something more complex and sophisticated
[21:23:22] <Matt|home> .. nope
[21:23:32] <MootPoot> I think you're expecting too much
[21:23:42] <Matt|home> yeah. good writing.
[21:23:47] <Matt|home> haven't seen that in decades
[21:23:49] <MootPoot> a mass market action film wont ever get any better

[21:24:36] <MootPoot> dune was decent
[21:25:13] <MootPoot> but I dont really expect much for a cookie cutter mass market film - Its like expecting 5 star service and food from mcdonalds
[21:25:28] <Matt|home> when it comes to sci fi.. im hypercritical since it's my favorite genre. i was tricked into seeing some pile of garbage shit and refuse called "annihilation" when my friend told me it was, and i quote, "hard sci fi you'll like"
[21:25:47] <Matt|home> i literally walked out of the theatre into my car before the movie was finished and screamed at myself the whole ride home and haven't seen a movie since.

[23:31:30] <MootPoot> idol anime is like the marvel movies of japan
[23:31:32] <MootPoot> straight trash
[23:31:47] <MootPoot> but somehow people care enough for them to keep making them
