[01:06:44] <fnstudio> hello! i've started listening to radio streams via emms
[01:07:05] <fnstudio> this is how i let emms know about my favourite streams: https://paste.debian.net/1205580/
[01:07:38] <fnstudio> that's saved in a "streams.emms" file in my emacs config folder
[01:08:28] *** Quits: richardN (~richardN@101.39.196.178.dynamic.wline.res.cust.swisscom.ch) (Quit: richardN)
[01:08:31] <fnstudio> the file gets read successfully and if i type "M-x emms-streams" i'm given a list of all streams (in the pastebin example, that'd be only one stream now)
[01:09:37] <fnstudio> now... if i add the stream via its https url and then i play it, it takes ages for the stream to start playing (e.g. 30 secs)
[01:09:56] <fnstudio> if i add it via http, it's nearly instantaneous
[01:10:13] <fnstudio> this seems to be consistent across different streams
[01:11:01] <fnstudio> also, both stream versions (http and https) seem all to start instantaneously if i try launching them via mpv from the command line (or any other similar tool)

[01:11:47] <fnstudio> therefore, i'd tend to think there might be some snag in the way https is handled by either emms or emacs (at least on my system)

[04:24:51] <mattf> The point is  i want to have that function to make it easy for so many things that pop up in a split buffer down but dont focus it
[04:25:32] <mattf> But im not really interested on a better way of doing that, i want to know why does that code says "wrong argument commandp"
[04:26:19] <bpalmer> not every function is a command; keys can only be bound to a command.
[04:26:21] *** Joins: nate3 (~nate@108-233-125-227.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[04:26:42] <bpalmer> to be a command, a function has to have an interactive spec; thet lambdas you create do not. 
[04:26:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Interactiveness determines command state.
[04:27:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: Is that so? 
[04:27:09] <bpalmer> (Also, note that your code is reliant on lexical-binding to be true, which may or may not be the case, depending on emacs version and your settings)

[04:27:51] <mattf> damn
[04:27:52] <bpalmer> Aurora_v_kosmose: not entirely. YOu can call commands interactively or non-interactively. When called interactively, the interactive spec is consulted.
[04:27:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (bind-key "C-x a" (lambda () (interactive) (message "owo"))) ;; this works for me
[04:28:11] <mattf> well i knew that already
[04:28:49] <mattf> ok that was one problem
[04:28:55] <mattf> thanks Aurora_v_kosmose 
[04:28:59] <mattf> no
[04:29:02] <mattf> thanks bpalmer 
[04:29:21] <mattf> now symbol as value as variable is void: func
[04:29:33] <bpalmer> that's the lexical binding issue coming into play.
[04:30:08] <bpalmer> Elisp by default uses dynamic scope, which means that when your function is called, it uses the value of func *at that point in time* to evaluate the function.
[04:30:29] <bpalmer> Nowadays, lexical scope is more common: at function creation, it looks to see what the current value of func is, and captures that.
[04:30:53] <mattf> aaah i see inside the lambda func does not come in
[04:30:57] <bpalmer> rather, the current binding, I should say, because lexical closures will notice changes in value of that binding.
[04:30:58] *** Joins: lisp123_ (~lisp123@45.130.83.200)
[04:31:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Scheme dynamic-fluids are a thing.
[04:31:59] <bpalmer> You can make sure that you're evaluating this in a file that has lexical-binding: t  at the top; you can make sure it's being evaluated in one of hte buffers that (emacs 28?) has said will default to lexical-binding; you can create a macro instead; you can use quasiquote; or you can use thelexical-let macro
[04:32:00] <mattf> damn so how can i pass func to the lambda

[04:32:53] <bpalmer> one easy way which will work "everywhere" is to (lexical-let ((func func)) (lambda () (funcall func) (evil-window-down)))   , inside your function definer

[06:48:02] <himesama> ok
[06:48:11] <bpalmer> privately <- that's going to depend on whom you're trying to be private from. If it's facebook, the best way to be private might be to ask somebody who's already in the group to copy and paste and send it to you via email, or send screenshots
[06:48:37] <bpalmer> facebook group posts are not, I believe, usually sent directly on email; instead, they send you a notification that there's a post on the site that you should go to. (with a link)
[06:48:50] *** CecilRhodes is now known as NewPerson
[06:49:06] <himesama> too much to ask copy and pastei think; it is posts every day
[06:49:14] <bpalmer> In theory, you could write a web extension that automatically copies and pastes from the group to send it to you, and ask somebody to install the extension, but they'd have to trust you a lot.
[06:49:43] <bpalmer> since it could be exfiltrating everything they see on facebook to you with the same permissions.
[06:49:49] <himesama> the latter would be not so much an issue as the former.   i could not write the extensin.

[06:58:43] <bpalmer> or, another approach is for a company to approach the developer and say, "What about including this analytic toolkit to help us track something, in exchange for money?" Sometimes this is actually just an analytic script; sometimes it's malware.
[06:59:07] <bpalmer> there's an entire chain of trust going on behind the scenes.

[07:07:04] <himesama> why would that occur?

[07:08:01] <bpalmer> Some people can't type their email address correctly, and some companies/sites don't make them verify their email address immediately
[07:08:38] <bpalmer> (Note that requiring phone numbers is one way to help establish verified email addresses or better account recovery options)

[17:31:32] <bpalmer> (similarly, javascript, particularly in the early years, is not that complicated a language by itself; but it's the DOM and being attached to a web browser that people are likely to want)

[20:21:11] <krux02> the problem is, that I would like emacs to not do it anymore, unless I really want it
[20:21:17] <krux02> yes
[20:21:53] <krux02> and swapping is also the behavior for x11 windows, as they can't be displayed in two emacs windows at the same time.

[20:22:31] <krux02> I am new to exwm, so I am still figuring things out
[20:22:53] <krux02> well I think I find a solution.
[20:23:22] <krux02> I think the solution will be some hook that checks if the same buffer is currently already displayed and then do a swap somehow.

[22:10:19] <lisp123> I get (void-variable lazy) when trying

[22:13:29] <lisp123> Thanks though

[22:14:31] <lisp123> I did it via the customize menu (after C-h v) and it did (custom-set-variables '(completion-auto-help 'lazy))
