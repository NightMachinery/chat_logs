[00:13:25] <FreeBDSM> hi, why doesn't `print -l "${(ok)functions[(I)[^_]*]}"` return sorted list? the output for me is the same as without the `(ok)` part.
[00:14:13] *** Quits: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[00:14:25] <llua> you got one big string there
[00:14:45] <FreeBDSM> oh my
[00:14:56] <FreeBDSM> the "" there change behavior!
[00:14:59] *** Quits: Torr (~Torr@user/torr) (Quit: leaving)
[00:15:13] <FreeBDSM> `print -l ${(ok)functions[(I)[^_]*]}` returns a sorted multi-line output
[00:15:31] <llua> or adding @ to the ()
[00:16:34] <FreeBDSM> thanks, I prefer ${} double-quoted everywhere possible
[00:17:09] <FreeBDSM> yeah, it worked correct when `(ok)` got replaced with `($ok)`
[00:17:17] <FreeBDSM> err `(@ok)`
[00:17:18] <Mikachu> the only effect here is breaking the construct basically
[00:17:35] <Mikachu> well
[00:17:45] <Mikachu> the empty string is for some godforsaken reason a valid function name, so that's not strictly true
[00:18:18] <FreeBDSM> because that's what anonymous functions are?
[00:18:23] <Mikachu> not at all
[00:18:27] <Mikachu> anonymous functions don't have a name
[00:18:43] <FreeBDSM> ah, so null vs empty string, got it
[00:19:48] <FreeBDSM> looks like `(@o)` gives the same output as `(@ok)` there
[00:20:05] <Mikachu> (k) is the default when you use (I), probably
[00:20:08] *** __jmcantrell__ is now known as jmcantrell
[00:21:18] <FreeBDSM> yeah, without the `[...]` part the output for `(@o)` vs `(@ok)` differs
[00:21:54] *** Quits: t0kie (~t0kie@user/t0kie) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:23:00] <FreeBDSM> where do I have a lot of functions like _mpv or _vlc from? they have the same body, which is just `builtin autoload -XUz`
[00:23:35] <Mikachu> the completion system
[00:24:45] <FreeBDSM> I thought I didn't need functions for that
[00:28:12] <ft> It's a function based completion system. So functions are kind of at its centre. :)
[00:30:30] <FreeBDSM> I've created a new function: `function _vlctest () { builtin autoload -XUz }`, but when I type `vl{TAB}` it doesn't get suggested...
[00:32:11] <ft> Well. You need to make the connection between function and completion context too.
[00:32:28] <ft> Also, the autoload body is about autoloaded functions.
[00:32:50] <ft> They get filled from files in $fpath the first time they are referenced.
[00:33:04] <Mikachu> there's a lot wrong here
[00:33:09] <Mikachu> not with what ft said
[00:33:20] <ft> I wrote this once: http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2012/003/
[00:33:34] <Mikachu> but if you're trying to stop functions with a leading _ from being completed, you want this
[00:33:34] <ft> For a brief intro with a number of further reading links.
[00:33:45] <Mikachu> zstyle ':completion:*:functions' prefix-needed true

[00:42:09] <FreeBDSM> Mikachu: I don't want that, I am just trying to understand whether that's normal that I have so many declared functions that I don't use (at least knowingly)...
[00:43:13] <ft> It is. As soon as you run ‘compinit’, the completion system marks all _* function from $fpath for autoloading and registers them with the completion dispatch system.

[18:47:57] <CodeSpelunker> and "find-file" would just no-op

[18:51:56] <Gamma> or man zshall to get all the docs
[18:52:20] <CodeSpelunker> I tried zshall and grepped for autoload, but that didn't work too well
[18:53:27] <Gamma> I did man zshbuiltins, found autoload, which has a note to check 'Autoloading functions' in zshmisc
[18:53:53] <CodeSpelunker> appreciate the guidance anyway hehe
[18:54:34] <CodeSpelunker> but like, I don't really see where it talks about -U and -z here either...
[18:54:48] <CodeSpelunker> there's a ton of text here to read through

[19:04:54] <llua> in bash, you would've needed "${fpath[@]}" anyway, so yeah, poor muscle memory
[19:07:58] <CodeSpelunker> ok, have all that back with fpath, and still nothing
[19:08:20] <Gamma> CodeSpelunker: but back to your main problem, your file names should have the same name as your functions
[19:08:27] <CodeSpelunker> yep, got that
[19:08:51] <CodeSpelunker> "which jump" shows me "undefined, builtin autoload -XU"
[19:09:12] <CodeSpelunker> calling "jump" does nothing, and the "which" changes to the function body
[19:09:49] <CodeSpelunker> ohhh I should remove the __ prefix right?
[19:09:52] <CodeSpelunker> that may be it
[19:10:01] <Gamma> yeah, same name, no __ prefix
[19:10:17] <llua> you autoload the name of the file
[19:10:38] <CodeSpelunker> ok, I took that out, but still nothin

[19:11:51] <CodeSpelunker> oh, actually, might have it, one sec
[19:12:11] <CodeSpelunker> it depends on another one, but I think that other one still has the __ prefix
[19:12:45] <CodeSpelunker> and just to be clear, I should end each of the files with a call to the fn right?
[19:13:00] <Gamma> I was about to ask  that
[19:13:18] <CodeSpelunker> like each of them should be something like "function my-func() { ... } <newline> my-func"
[19:13:20] <Gamma> The file should just contain the function body, not the function-name(){ header
[19:13:33] <CodeSpelunker> I see
[19:14:03] <Gamma> I figured that was the case when you mentioned something only working the second time
[19:14:09] <CodeSpelunker> that one SO post I saw was really different then lol

[19:18:29] <Gamma> actually, shoudl probably be "$1": reload(){ unfunction - "$1"; autoload -Uz - "$1"; "$@" }

[19:19:12] <Mikachu> well, i guess it doesn't matter if your un it last, i only unfunction + autoload in mine, no run
[19:19:30] <Gamma> true, I use +X in my efn and hifn functions (edit-function, highlight-function)
[19:19:36] <CodeSpelunker> that reminds me, what's the usual way to activate compinit and colors?
[19:19:39] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[19:19:46] <Mikachu> colors is obsolete since 10 years or so
[19:19:56] <CodeSpelunker> wow, I should take that out then haha
[19:20:10] <Mikachu> eg, instead of %{$colors[red]%} you can just do %F{red}
[19:20:25] <CodeSpelunker> awesome!
[19:20:31] <Mikachu> assuming it's for a prompt
[19:20:36] <CodeSpelunker> yeah
[19:20:44] <CodeSpelunker> how about compinit?
[19:21:01] <CodeSpelunker> I have "autoload compinit && compinit", but I assume that's wrong
[19:21:10] <Mikachu> it's fine
[19:21:19] <CodeSpelunker> oh.  Thank goodness
[19:21:20] <Mikachu> the && is sort of pointless though, autoload can't fail
[19:21:42] <CodeSpelunker> does it make sense to autoload if I'm immediately calling it?
[19:21:48] <Mikachu> you have to
[19:22:13] <Gamma> autoload is "hey Zsh, there's a function with this name in your $fpath, remember that"
[19:22:19] <CodeSpelunker> gotcha
[19:22:28] <Mikachu> autoload foo essentially creates a function foo() { autoload +X }, which when run will populate the function body with the actual file contents
[19:23:39] <CodeSpelunker> also, what is zmodload?
[19:24:15] <Gamma> it loads zsh modules, see man zshmodules

[19:42:36] <Mikachu> makes sense
[19:43:14] <Mikachu> just a heads up that using direct zwc files in $fpath *will* make you confused at some point
[19:43:21] <llua> autoloadable functions are like import for python or require in ruby.

[20:19:41] <CodeSpelunker> oh haha
[20:19:49] <Mikachu> oops i guess it worked despite my goof though
[20:20:02] <Mikachu> it's core, not a module
[20:20:18] <CodeSpelunker> it's pretty cool that zsh can source what looks like a binary file
[20:20:55] <CodeSpelunker> uhhhh...it spit out a bunch of stuff at me when I tried
[20:21:09] <Mikachu> you can't source the zwc file
[20:21:13] <Mikachu> just source the original file
[20:21:23] <CodeSpelunker> I'm confused
[20:21:26] <Mikachu> which i thought followed from "don't do anything differently" :)
[20:21:33] <CodeSpelunker> I'm trying to load the compiled one though
[20:21:41] <Mikachu> > echo echo hi > foo; zmodload zsh/zcompile; rm foo; source ./foo
[20:21:43] <machabot> Mikachu: /dev/stdin:1: failed to load module `zsh/zcompile': /usr/lib/zsh/5.8/zsh/zcompile.so: cannot open shared object file: No...

[20:21:51] <Mikachu> i'm not smart today
[20:21:56] <Gamma> 'source file' first checks for 'file.zwc'
[20:22:02] <CodeSpelunker> ohhhh
[20:22:04] <Mikachu> i removed the zcompile instead of the zmodload
[20:22:13] <Mikachu> > echo echo hi > foo; zcompile foo; rm foo; source ./foo
[20:22:14] <Gamma> and will source it if it's newer than 'file'
[20:22:14] <machabot> Mikachu: hi
[20:22:16] <Mikachu> there we go
[20:22:22] <Mikachu> i sourced "./foo" but the file didn't even exist
[20:22:31] <Mikachu> the point here was to prove that the zwc file is used
[20:23:06] <Gamma> ofc, you don't need to *remove* the original, and probly shouldn't :)
[20:25:14] <CodeSpelunker> so I have it in the same dir and source-ing like before, but I still get a bunch of stuff printed
[20:25:32] <CodeSpelunker> mostly "@^"
[20:26:07] <phy1729> Presumably ^@ which is NUL
[20:26:11] <CodeSpelunker> hmmm, I guess I should specify the non-compiled
[20:26:32] <CodeSpelunker> right now, I have it source every file in the dir, which would probably try the compiled ones as well
[20:27:00] <Gamma> yes. trying to source the compiled file will try to source the compiled file as if it isn't a compile file
[20:27:33] <Gamma> source foo.zwc is never correct
[20:29:35] <Gamma> oh, I get it. Use `source dir/^*.zwc`
[20:29:40] <CodeSpelunker> yay, I think that was it
[20:29:43] <CodeSpelunker> :D
[20:29:46] <CodeSpelunker> yep!
[20:30:00] <CodeSpelunker> woah you can source an entire dir at once?
[20:30:04] <CodeSpelunker> I was using a loop
[20:30:06] <Gamma> no, you cant
[20:30:08] <CodeSpelunker> oh lol
[20:30:28] <Gamma> I messed up, it would source just the first file with the remaining files passed as arguments
[20:30:37] <CodeSpelunker> no worries
[20:30:58] <Gamma> Was about to correct myself but you beat me to it 
[20:31:02] <CodeSpelunker> :)
[20:31:59] <Gamma> make sure you use the same pattern for when you zcompile files, else you create file.zwc.zwc.zwc.zwc
[20:32:24] <Gamma> (note: I've done this before)
[20:32:39] <Mikachu> "sourcing all files in a dir" is sort of a weird pattern
[20:33:51] <CodeSpelunker> is it? what's weird about it?

[20:35:56] <Gamma> I source from ~/.config/zsh/local/*.zsh ~/.config/zsh/plugins/*/*.zsh
[20:36:25] <Gamma> idk what would be a better pattern
[20:36:48] <CodeSpelunker> I should probably switch my files to go in .config too, I like that
[20:37:03] <CodeSpelunker> I have most stuff in the top-level home right now
[20:37:10] <CodeSpelunker> kinda ugly
[20:37:15] <Gamma> Zsh doesn't natively support that, you need at least a ~/.zshenv
[20:37:29] <Gamma> With ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh
[20:37:40] <CodeSpelunker> that works
[20:37:53] <CodeSpelunker> I was gonna just have some small thing in zshrc, but that's even nicer
[20:38:31] <CodeSpelunker> after that, would it pick up .zshrc from ~/.config/zsh then?
[20:38:47] <CodeSpelunker> or can I change that so it's no longer a dotfile as well?
[20:39:08] <CodeSpelunker> like have it become "~/.config/zsh/zshrc" (no dot prefix)?
[20:39:22] <Gamma> It still needs to start with ".". Plus .zcompcache, .zsh_history, .zcompdump, etc all get created there too
[20:39:36] <CodeSpelunker> I see
[20:39:38] <Mikachu> the history file is wherever you specify, always
[20:39:45] <Gamma> oh right
[20:39:59] <Mikachu> you can specify the dump filename too, but you probably do want to hide that one if you can :)
[20:40:07] <Mikachu> no idea about compcache
[20:40:41] <Mikachu> i have ~/.zshrc symlinked to .zsh/.zshrc because i edit it a lot and i don't like typing (but i still want it in the .zsh dir for git tracking)
[20:40:41] <Gamma> mine is there, so it looks like it does respect ZDOTDIR
[20:41:04] <CodeSpelunker> I like that idea too
[20:41:16] <CodeSpelunker> source of truth will the in .config
[20:41:25] <Gamma> I have hash -d z=$ZDOTDIR; so ~z/.zshrc
