[04:19:05] <quanticle> "Air for the crew was provided by a bleed air system on the engine compressors. This air was hot and had to be cooled before being pumped into the cockpit. This cooling was provided by a large total-loss evaporator running on a mixture of 40% ethanol and 60% distilled water (effectively vodka). This system garnered the aircraft one of its many nicknames, the 'supersonic booze carrier'. As the
[04:19:07] <quanticle> system vented the coolant after use it was possible that the aircraft could run out during flight, and comfort had to be balanced by the possibility of running out of coolant. Numerous cases of Tu 22 crews drinking the coolant mixture and becoming paralytically drunk led to a crackdown by Soviet Air Force authorities. Access to the bombers after flights was restricted, and more frequent checks
[04:19:09] <quanticle> were made on coolant levels. This higher level of security, however, did not end the practice outright."

[06:24:52] <nshepperd2> CLIP has a lot of trouble with composition
[06:25:08] <nshepperd2> if you give it more than one object to put in a scene it tends to just mash them all together
[06:25:27] <gwern> blehh. we really need an open-source DALL-E, one that's better than Cogview or mini-dall-e
[06:26:09] <gwern> all of this jerking around with CLIP - yeah, it's impressive what you can do with a mere contrastive-learned pair of embeddings, but let's not kid ourselves, 90% of the users really just want dall-e

[06:27:05] <shawwwn> yeah, it's a shame no one has the skill to do an open source dalle
[06:27:12] <shawwwn> also that dalle itself was a fake
[06:27:41] <shawwwn> (they hired a few dozen artists with NDAs)
[06:28:04] <gwern> that'll get expensive once they open up the dall-e api soonish
[06:29:09] <shawwwn> served the purpose. gave them like a year of publicity and time to retrain
[06:29:10] <nshepperd2> cosimilarity on R^512 just doesn't seem expressive enough
[06:30:43] <shawwwn> why cosimilarity when you can sinsimilarity? the devil's side is more fun
[06:32:27] <nshepperd2> some sort of perceiver IO thing with a learned similarity metric might be better
[06:32:31] <meowcat> are we turning cotheorems into ffee again?
[06:33:51] <shawwwn> that reminds me of when I kept corrupting my memory in my old game engines and getting 0xffeeffee values
[06:34:11] <shawwwn> apparently microsoft used to use 0xffeeffee as some kind of sentinel something
[06:35:47] <nshepperd2> i'm sure contrastive learning could learn composition if you scaled it up more and threw a bunch of attention nets at it
[06:35:55] <gwern> nshepperd2: I dunno, r^512 is a hell of a lot of information: that's what, 32 * 512 = 16,384 bits, encoding 2^16384 possibilities? which my handy R tells me equals 'Inf', so sounds pretty big
[06:37:18] <nshepperd2> yeah, but using cosine similarity crushes that down to way less than all 2^16384 possibilities because it's linear
[06:37:47] <gwern> it's fed through many nonlinearities so I dunno how much that logic holds
[06:37:59] <gwern> even in stylegan, a lot of the latents are fairly uninterpretable
[06:39:09] <nshepperd2> it's a bottleneck
[06:41:10] <gwern> but a quite capacious one, at least in theory. maybe not 2^16k but who knows how much exactly
[06:42:47] <nshepperd2> the nonlinearities don't matter if the final step throws away all that information by turning it into a linear map
[06:45:54] <nshepperd2> when you train clip, and when you optimize an image with it, you just train on cosim(image_embed, text_embed) or great_circle_distance(image_embed,text_embed). neither of which have the nonlinearity required to extract any sort of complex encoding from the embeddings
[06:49:27] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:50:15] <nshepperd2> (but i think why you can do arithmetic with clip embeddings and get something that mostly works. embed1 + embed2 can't have a meaning that is substantially different from each of the individual inputs)
[06:51:34] <shawwwn> someone should invent nonlinear linearities
[06:51:38] <shawwwn> that would probably solve a lot of problems
[06:52:29] <nshepperd2> sounds illegal

[06:53:50] <shawwwn> it sounds a bit laksjdfnwlerjqwuerasdfl
[06:53:56] <gwern> it can be locally linearish but highly nonlinear overall with near-discontinuous shifts /shrug
[06:54:16] <gwern> anyway whatever a hypothetical super-clip could do, dall-e is still a much more straightforward way of doing image synthesis

[12:48:20] <PapuaHardyNet> sheesh, this is ridiculous, you are right
[12:49:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Disable JS" as an approach only works for sites that work in the way that a normal tech-savvy person might naively (and reasonably) imagine that a JS-enabled site might work, namely "send the HTML page with all the content to the browser; also send some JS; the JS runs and adds some fancy shit to the page or transforms it somehow"
[12:50:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is in fact the way gwern.net, GreaterWrong, etc. work)
[12:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> But many real-world JS-enabled sites do not work that way
[12:51:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead, they're like "send the browser some JS (with the HTML response being merely a vehicle for the JS); the JS then retrieves the content and constructs the page basically from scratch"
[12:51:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Medium, Less Wrong, innumerable others)
[12:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> So if you disable JS, you just get nothing

[22:46:48] <kuudes> at age 16 there are 4000 surviving per 1 death in finland, at age 18 there are 2000 surviving per 1 death in finland
[22:48:19] <kuudes> so at age 16 1/4000 of people survived to 16 die before turning 17, so 0.025% and at 18 1/2000 , so 0.05%

[22:49:38] <kuudes> but indeed I see between ages 12 and 45 an increase of mortality if one compares mortality to the linear trendline after age 45
[22:50:24] <kuudes> and peak at age 7 and 12 sort of hit that trendline, so I interpret so that sexual selection exerts mortality pressure for humans in finlan
[22:50:38] <kuudes> at about 10x the biological age specific mortality

[23:13:11] <shawwwn> at my first job, we had some networking people that lived in a broom closet. or at least I'm pretty sure it used to be a broom closet. They didn't live there, but they did work there
[23:13:44] <shawwwn> anyway, watching porn at work turns out to be a bad idea, because your networking people will see it
[23:14:00] <shawwwn> I never quite put two and two together until years later though 
[23:17:56] <kuudes> are they allowed to watch your traffic?
[23:18:33] <shawwwn> I think it's their job

[23:19:09] <gwern> I'm sure they're used to it, so no biggie. unless it gets you fired or something
[23:19:38] <kuudes> over here the employer is not allowed to inspect private traffic
[23:20:06] <shawwwn> that's a nice law
[23:20:25] <shawwwn> it didn't get me fired, and I'm pretty sure they didn't mention it to anybody. but the networking guy suddenly got chummy with me out of nowhere one day
[23:20:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, you could just ask them what they like and keep that on in the background
[23:20:33] <shawwwn> and the networking girl got super weirded out by me

[23:21:03] <kuudes> hmm, I wonder what's the current state. nokia got caught from snooping and they demanded a law change to allow such

[23:27:38] <Robomot> Luxury Beliefs (Luxury Beliefs)
[23:27:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unfortunately, the luxury beliefs of the upper class often trickle down and are adopted by people lower down the food chain, which means many of these beliefs end up causing social harm. Take polyamory. I had a revealing conversation recently with a student at an elite university. He said that when he sets his Tinder radius to five miles, about half of the women, mostly other students, said they were “polyamorous” in
[23:27:47] <Obormot\Arcturus>  their bios. Then, when he extended the radius to 15 miles to include the rest of the city and its outskirts, about half of the women were single mothers. The costs created by the luxury beliefs of the former are borne by the latter."
[23:29:21] <gwern> I'm not a fan of polyamory but blaming widespread singlemotherhood on a practice almost no one has ever heard of seems like a stretch
[23:30:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Polyamory per se is clearly a stand-in here for sexual liberation and non-longterm-monogamy more broadly
[23:31:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Serial monogamy without commitment" or what have you is part of the same category
[23:31:13] <gwern> you have to go back a long time to find the initial elite gradient there to blame
