[00:00:20] <manicennui> Because we externalized the cost in our military budget.
[00:00:45] <edk> there's a lot of oil in america too to be fair
[00:00:53] <bkero> wut
[00:00:54] <manicennui> And Canadistan.
[00:00:55] <kirch> not as cheap as it should be, according to conservative-leaning people on the street - and somehow it's exclusively the President's fault... because the president controls the free market ;P
[00:01:04] <bkero> There is not that much oil in the United States.
[00:01:09] <manicennui> kirch: That's what makes it free!
[00:01:16] <bkero> Not nearly enough to meet demand
[00:01:43] <kirch> well, it's any Democrat's fault if they're in charge..... every POTUS for the past 40+ years has "Tried to reduce our dependence on foreign oil" to some degree or another without doing anything to hamper oil consumption here.
[00:01:50] <manicennui> "The United States has proven reserves equivalent to 4.9 times its annual consumption."
[00:01:56] <companion_cube> kirch: it's crazy
[00:02:02] <companion_cube> it's not even a dollar per liter
[00:02:08] <kirch> like... people gripe about my governor making gas too expensive...
[00:02:29] <bkero> How long do those reserves last though?
[00:02:40] <bkero> and how long until they become not-cost-effective?
[00:02:42] <manicennui> About 5 years with 0 imports.
[00:02:47] <manicennui> And no new exploration.
[00:03:03] <manicennui> We should reduce our consumption overall, and reduce our imports.
[00:03:32] <manicennui> And never go to war to secure resources.
[00:03:38] <bkero> Uhh, is that based on the 4.9 number?
[00:03:47] <bkero> That just means the oil is there, not that it's cost-effective to extract.
[00:03:49] <manicennui> bkero: Yes, that is exactly what the 4.9 number means.
[00:05:14] <bkero> If it costs $100,000 a barrel to pull it out of the ground, filter the sand out of it, and hire the polar bear hunters, it's not cost effective, even if it is there.
[00:05:38] <bkero> I imagine we have another few years of oil sitting in landfills as well. Also not cost effective.
[00:05:43] <manicennui> That isn't a good reason to invade other countries to put puppet governments in place so we can get cheap oil.
[00:05:53] <bkero> Nope
[00:05:53] <manicennui> That should be a reason to stop relying on oil.
[00:05:59] <bkero> Correct
[00:06:15] <companion_cube> manicennui: maybe you're not a conservative
[00:06:55] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't like to use that term for Republicans.
[00:06:59] <manicennui> They aren't conservatives.
[00:07:06] <manicennui> They aren't trying to conserve anything.
[00:07:26] <bkero> Sure they are. Their position in the social order.
[00:07:32] <bkero> and their "way of life"
[00:07:45] <bkero> That doesn't mean it isn't based on a fantasy though.
[00:08:11] <manicennui> bkero: Democrats want that too.
[00:08:36] <manicennui> But democrats actually *do* want to conserve traditional institutions, democracy, freedom of religion, etc.
[00:09:02] <edk> bkero: the US doesn't have the most, but combined with its being a massive oil consumer it's enough to exert an awful lot of control over the oil market
[00:09:05] <manicennui> At least the bulk of the party.
[00:09:30] <prussian> aren't high oil prices exactly what Trump wanted?
[00:09:32] <manicennui> Chicago is going to require masks everywhere again.
[00:09:34] <prussian> still confused.
[00:09:35] <edk> (and it's fair enough for free marketers to get annoyed when it uses that ability to dick around with saudi arabia i guess; that is largely something controlled by the government)
[00:10:27] <manicennui> companion_cube: I hope you were being sarcastic though. I'm not a conservative.
[00:10:56] <companion_cube> I was, yes :)
[00:11:38] <manicennui> There are probably positions I agree with *actual* conservatives on, but not because I'm clinging to the past or putting traditions on a pedestal.
[00:12:13] <edk> i think the conservatives are fantasising somewhat if they think their position in the social order is worth preserving
[00:12:30] <manicennui> Most Republicans aren't even in any kind of high position.
[00:12:35] <manicennui> They are boot lickers for those who are.
[00:12:56] <manicennui> While also somehow opposing "the establishment".
[00:13:05] <manicennui> Which seems to just be anyone they oppose.
[00:13:52] <edk> i think they're imagining some sort of return to the days when you could be well-off just by working hard
[00:14:03] <manicennui> I'm still considering moving to North Carolina. Republicans are one of the things giving me pause.
[00:14:07] <edk> but there weren't very many of those days, even in america, and nothing the conservatives are doing will bring them back
[00:14:28] <manicennui> edk: That had more to do with no other industrialized country left standing after WWII.
[00:14:33] <edk> yeah
[00:15:07] <manicennui> And it's not clear how any of their positions on various issues would lead to that situation.
[00:15:39] <edk> no, but i'm not trying to claim it's logical
[00:16:39] <edk> i just think that when they consider their place in society it's with respect to a society they imagine to be fundamentally like that

[02:15:06] <manicennui> "He is getting the Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment."
[02:15:09] <manicennui> Convenient.
[02:15:22] <Brekkjern> He's just gotten the vaccine in secret
[02:15:23] <Brekkjern> :P

[02:16:42] <manicennui> I read earlier that we are going to be told to get a booster 8 months after being vaccinated.

[02:40:30] <manicennui> That behavior is so weird to me.
[02:40:35] <manicennui> How did we breed for that?
[02:41:22] <manicennui> https://theweek.com/afghanistan/1003796/biden-argues-us-troops-shouldnt-fight-in-war-that-afghan-forces-are-not-willing
[02:42:46] <Brekkjern> It kind of fascinates me how so much focus there is on the statements of Biden like he had any real way to influence the beginning of the war
[02:43:14] <Brekkjern> And honestly, shit's fucked now. The coalition can't just go back and unfuck it. That's gonna be a real pain to do
[02:43:48] <Brekkjern> Like, if you thought there was heavy losses going in originally, they will pale in comparison if the coalition goes back in.
[02:50:36] <manicennui> They would have blamed him no matter what happened.
[02:50:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:51:03] <Brekkjern> I'm just fascinated with the circles american media is doing talking about it
[02:51:35] <Brekkjern> In Norway it's devolved into reporting the shitstorm on the ground and political analysis of Taliban and how we expect they will continue their government
[02:51:53] <Brekkjern> And criticism about not bringing back enough refugees etc
[02:53:09] <companion_cube> Maybe that's a secret plan to let the taliban show themselves in the open, so the US can come back and kill them
[02:53:14] <companion_cube> /s obviously
[03:05:16] <kline>  manicennui | That behavior is so weird to me.
[03:05:24] <kline> the whole umbrella of breeds are called "pointers"
[03:05:28] <kline> for this exact behaviour
[03:05:28] <manicennui> I know.
[03:05:38] <manicennui> But how do you breed a behavior into them like that?
[03:05:49] <manicennui> Why would it be a natural thing they did?
[03:05:56] <kline> it doesnt have to be natural
[03:06:16] <manicennui> It has to somehow appear as a mutation, to a limited extent.
[03:06:21] <manicennui> You can't train their genes.
[03:06:27] <kline> all you need to do is find a dog that displays even the slightest lean towards it and amplify it
[03:06:44] <kline> all that needs to be is a dog that hesitates a second before chasing after prey
[03:06:48] <kline> >cant train
[03:06:57] <kline> but you can use training to identify predisposition
[03:07:37] <kline> dogs that are quicker or more reliable in this behaviour are likely to be better candidates in selective breeding
[03:08:23] <ngoldbaum> so let’s make breeds that can’t breathe because their face is unnaturally flat
[03:15:53] <manicennui> I just want to see the initial pointers.
[03:17:02] <ngoldbaum> ptr*
[03:23:16] <kline> manicennui, its probably literally just a dog whose natural instinct was to be investigative and pause to sniff around when it smelled something rather than dash straight after it
[03:23:48] <kline> followed by a dog that's more and more "hesitant" until you get to the modern pointer

[14:50:54] <Brekkjern> >The author states this themselves. And they go on to hypothesize that if Microsoft and Salesforce both supported some other format, the rest of the world would come to adopt it.
[14:50:54] <Brekkjern> When I press "Save As" with Excel, I can choose between 18 different formats. Granted, some of them are variations to support different platforms, but still...
[14:52:34] <Brekkjern> 9 of them are Excel proprietary. The rest are mostly structured in various forms and open "standards"
[14:54:27] <Brekkjern> I guess the problem is a combination of "XKCD Standards" and "Not like that!"
[14:57:36] <Brekkjern> Meh. It's all bikeshedding... This post won't solve anything at all...
[15:58:03] <prussian> are we talking about the CSV article?
[15:58:07] <prussian> cuz, ya, kill it.
[15:59:52] <Brekkjern> Yeah, it was the CSV article
[16:01:07] <prussian> speaking of Excel, at my work, someone made a whole DSL using it to describe fake hardware.
[16:01:25] <prussian> absolutely devilish use of excel if I may say so myself.
[16:02:20] <Brekkjern> That sounds awesome :D
[16:02:36] <Brekkjern> I mean... It's probably brittle AF, but it's still funny
[16:02:46] <prussian> it's something. idk.
[16:02:53] <prussian> I keep being reminded to quit.
[16:03:30] <prussian> I know someone who needs a position filled as some operator in a secure room doing maintenance crap, but I'd rather not go back to sysadmining.
[16:04:16] <prussian> anyhow, solution. use the sqlite3 dump format to export columnar data... simple as.
[16:04:57] <Brekkjern> The only reason more technical formats like that are "better" is because there is usually a reasonably technical person who has entered the data
[16:04:59] <gwozniak> hoistbypetard: as gerikson said, it's Rob Ford's brother. Rob Ford was the mayor of Toronto (2010-2014) and died in 2016.
[16:05:22] <prussian> and ya. Excel's ooxml format can at least be "parsed"
[16:05:26] <prussian> as you mention
[16:05:51] <prussian> even that hardware thing, ended up having to be interpreted by some java program.
[16:06:09] <prussian> I guess I'd rather excel's ooxml format than csv.
[16:06:24] <Brekkjern> I think CSV is just fine
[16:06:33] <prussian> sure.
[16:06:46] <gwozniak> I had to deal with a Excel ooxml thing once and it was okay
[16:06:48] <Brekkjern> If I get user generated CSV, then I just have to put the sanetization work on the users instead of me
[16:07:00] <hoistbypetard> I feel better for mixing them up then
[16:07:31] <prussian> better-er solution: json. duh.
[16:07:40] <prussian> json-lines even
[16:07:47] <skyl4rk> hm, I think it should be possible to translate <the blinkenlights text> to be about not manually editing csv
[16:07:47] <Brekkjern> Have you tried parsing user generated files of JSON?
[16:07:58] <prussian> https://jsonlines.org/examples/ the future is now...
[16:07:58] <buttsbot> JSON Lines Examples
[16:08:44] <Brekkjern> I've had to instruct people in how to modify XML files because the idea of <delimiters> is so foreign that they don't understand that the brackets are important
[16:08:44] <prussian> Brekkjern: idk what that means I guess? as in one written by humans?
[16:08:55] <Brekkjern> Yes
[16:08:57] <Brekkjern> Ish
[16:09:15] <prussian> damn hoomans.
[16:09:17] <Brekkjern> We usually gave them a file with sane settings in them, and they would modify them to fit their environment
[16:09:29] <Brekkjern> These were technical people and they still fucked it up more often than not
[16:09:38] <prussian> sounds about right.
[16:10:03] <Brekkjern> And it wasn't stuff like "You are missing a key", but blatant wrong XML format like missing a >, or not closing a tag.
[16:10:10] <prussian> lol
[16:10:27] <Brekkjern> Or just not understanding that it's a structure, so they would just paste some config block some random place into the file and think it would just work
[16:10:51] <prussian> in fairness, without a constant computer making sure you aren't fucking up, typing any complex format is a potential nightmare. I still manage to forget to semicolon here and there.
[16:11:05] <prussian> ya. makes sense.
[16:11:24] <prussian> you gotta learn to live and love xml in some respects.
[16:11:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but when the program spat out an error underlining the problem, they could still not figure it out
[16:11:43] <Brekkjern> "Hey, this tag isn't closed at line X." "Whut?"
[16:11:50] <prussian> makes sense.
[16:12:10] <prussian> making really truly magical compilers is tough. I guess that's where the second stage comes it, auto fixing.
[16:12:34] <Brekkjern> At some point I started thinking I should give them powershell scripts that would modify their configs for them so they couldn't cock that up, but I'd bet they could fuck up running the scripts..
[16:12:45] <prussian> in defense of these people too, some compilers can really make some wonky messages because the parser just blows right through the original problem.
[16:13:02] <prussian> this
[16:13:06] <prussian> that's a good idea.
[16:13:22] <prussian> but yes.... they'd manage to type the wrong arguments and fuck it up still.
[16:13:47] <prussian> I don't know man.
[16:14:18] <Brekkjern> The point I'm making is the format is completely irrelevant. As long as you are getting data from some endpoint you do not control you will have to have it sanitized. The best way to get good data is a wizard of some sort, or an API where they are responsible for unficking their data so the API accepts it.
[16:14:38] <Brekkjern> unfucking*
[16:15:11] <prussian> in defense of this article, even something like xml, allows for much better tools to let the user know they messed it up though.
[16:15:24] <Brekkjern> I've yet to see them :P
[16:15:26] <prussian> but idk. users suck
[16:15:43] <prussian> well... you got DTDs
[16:15:47] <prussian> for what it's worth.
[16:16:02] <Brekkjern> I'm just being sarcastic. I know they exist, but I've never seen them used well.
[16:16:06] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: precisely. The problem isn't the format most of the time.

[16:17:01] <buttsbot> XML Signature - Wikipedia
[16:17:24] <prussian> the absolute unit who made this deserves an award.
[16:17:28] <Brekkjern> Eh...
[16:17:42] <Brekkjern> We had over 900 lines long config files with XML
[16:18:06] <Brekkjern> Those sucked for us as much as the users who were brave enough to modify them
[16:18:22] <prussian> we must return to xml.
[16:18:45] <prussian> ben: I'm sorry to hear.
[16:18:46] <Brekkjern> To be fair, you could ignore everything but 40 lines or so of that file in most cases
[16:18:48] <prussian> .
[16:18:51] <prussian> wrong q
[16:19:07] <prussian> well that's good.
[16:19:33] <prussian> ok. there you go. I solved the problem. we must replace CSV with s-expressions
[16:19:37] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but the tokenization crashed often, so you'd end up without syntax highlighting and such :P
[16:19:54] <prussian> sounds about right.

[16:22:26] <prussian> I think the grammar is wrong though...
[16:23:37] <Brekkjern> How do you write lists of people?
[16:23:44] <prussian> I don't see the description for how 'c: x' works in the sepc.
[16:23:59] <prussian> x: \nperson 1\nperson 2 ...etc\n:
[16:24:12] <Brekkjern> Eh. They will fuck up that too
[16:24:35] <prussian> this grammar fascinates me though.
[16:24:41] <Brekkjern> Is it null, Null, or NULL?
[16:24:52] <Brekkjern> Or "Undefined"?
[16:24:55] <Brekkjern> Or "N/A"
[16:25:02] <prussian> well this thing doesn't have typing.
[16:25:53] <Brekkjern> So they just YOLO it?
[16:26:26] <prussian> well, I imagine if you use this format, you'd deseralize the values in your own way.
[16:27:19] <prussian> anyhow. I'm just shooting the shit. I don't have answers.
[16:27:54] <prussian> only more pointless segues.
[16:30:18] <Brekkjern> I have too many tabs open for this shit :(
[16:41:52] <Brekkjern> I should really learn how to deal with partitioning in Linux...
[16:41:57] <Brekkjern> And file systems and all that

[20:09:39] <manicennui> I think he might have been contracting or something before.

[22:26:12] <gwozniak> Joy. We are getting pressure from the higher-ups to look into AI/ML-based compiler optimizations.  This has everything to do with marketing and nothing to do with a working product

[22:27:01] <manicennui> "The AI said our binaries are already perfect."
[22:27:18] <gerikson> "the AI says this UB is just fine"
[22:28:08] <gwozniak> For one thing, you have to ship a model and never touch it (or be able to reproduce it) lest you run into debugging/support hell
[22:28:35] <manicennui> What do you model exactly?
[22:28:54] <manicennui> Like what kind of optimizations can ML find that the compiler doesn't already take advantage of?
[22:29:09] <pja> gwozniak: What you do is convince them to employ me as a consultant to write a very expensive report that will tell them to stop.
[22:29:17] <companion_cube> gwozniak: "we looked into it and it's shit"
[22:29:23] <manicennui> Do you hand optimize the machine code and then use that to train it?
[22:29:27] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: it just thinks really hard about it with its artificial brain
[22:29:52] <companion_cube> Don't forget a spinner to show that it's working hard
[22:30:16] <gwozniak> Presumably, the model would map snippets of code to machine instructions, or sequences of IR to machine instructions/other IR
[22:30:20] <manicennui> I want a 3D diagram of my code that spins around and lights up and stuff.
[22:30:41] <companion_cube> With some synthwave music
[22:30:50] <manicennui> gwozniak: And these mappings would not be what the compiler already generates?
[22:31:06] <manicennui> I guess that's what I'm not understanding.
[22:31:07] <gwozniak> manicennui: presumably
[22:31:38] <manicennui> How would it determine that compiling some code to different machine code or IR or IR to machine code is better?
[22:31:52] <gwozniak> I mean, I can see a use for it, but I will need to read up on it. I expect it will make things a lot more complicated for little to no gain
[22:32:22] <manicennui> And why wouldn't any optimizations that it suggests not be part of the compiler?
[22:32:54] <gwozniak> That's the thing: it won't know it's better, and it can't "learn on the go", otherwise it will be a complete disaster to debug when it generates something illegal
[22:33:52] <gwozniak> All we need is a "self learning compiler" to generate something subtlely wrong, then it gets thrown back to us with some model we have never seen
[22:34:19] <indigo> > I work at the FAANG considered the “dumbest” - do you think people like me have any hope for the future?

[22:34:32] <gwozniak> *superoptimizer
[22:34:52] <ngoldbaum> cb i found the best git take https://twitter.com/iancoldwater/status/1428054513433391104
[22:34:53] <buttsbot> Twitter - iancoldwater - the existence of git switch suggests the existence of git top and git bottom https://t.co/EkpUY0Ou6i
[22:38:13] <gerikson> lol
[22:39:23] <Brekkjern> It's got a command to flog something too...
[22:39:26] <Xe> gwozniak: just say you did it without doing anything?
[22:40:31] <cb> ngoldbaum: git checkout ass
[22:40:46] <pja> make love
[22:41:04] <Brekkjern> cb: That's why we should have changed the name to "trunk"
[22:41:33] <gwozniak> Xe: not sure what you're referring to
[22:42:11] <Xe> AI compiler optimization
[22:42:22] <Xe> the optimizer has if statements right?
[22:42:26] <Xe> that's AI
[22:43:08] <manicennui> Just tell your boss that your intelligence is completely artificial.
[22:43:54] <gwozniak> The difference being we can carefully trace through those if statements and know why something happens
[22:44:12] <gwozniak> AI models are basically black boxes
[22:45:01] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/qlc3r5lr04i71.jpg
[22:45:17] <gwozniak> I mean, it's a pain to figure out why some instruction gets placed sometimes, but we can get an explanation.  With AI, we'd say, "well, the model said to do it"
[22:45:47] <Brekkjern> I think the point is that since the people pushing for AI don't actually know what it is, you can pass off some minor feature as "AI Optimized Thingymabob" and they would be happy since they can slap AI on some marketing material
[22:48:10] <gwozniak> It's coming up because AI/ML is getting to be a big thing in embedded right now, mainly to say they're doing it
[22:48:27] <gwozniak> Hence the uptick in C++ issues, since all that stuff is C++

[22:48:54] <gwozniak> And yeah, we could just make something up, but we can also say, "It'll be a shitshow"
[22:48:55] <Geekingfrog> ML in embedded?
[22:49:01] <cb> i can't imagine how well an AVR32 would handle ML tasks
[22:49:15] <gwozniak> cb: I'm back on Arm/MIPS for a while :/
[22:49:40] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: yup. No idea what people are doing with it, but it's definitely something customers are using
[22:50:02] <Geekingfrog> but you mean, using embedded devices to train models?
[22:52:02] <gwozniak> maybe...?  They are building TensorFlow for some of the 32-bit devices (and 16, apparently)
[22:52:37] <gwozniak> Again, don't know what they're doing, but they definitely want C++ support for TensorFlow

[23:41:13] <pja> Geekingfrog: Mobile phone chipsets are “embedded” but they get ML engines these days,
[23:41:42] <dmc> it's eerie how often GitHub's interface gets updated
[23:42:08] <dmc> little tweaks here and there
[23:42:28] <manicennui> That seems to be the main thing their engineers work on.
[23:42:34] <dmc> now how the reactions are displayed is a little different
[23:42:44] <manicennui> And it just becomes different, never better.
[23:43:01] <dmc> their interface is quite nice
[23:43:28] <dmc> the data mining must be a thing of beauty though
