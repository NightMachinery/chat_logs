[12:17:36] <Psy-Q> the Plasma emoji selector shows them, though (!), just when pasted into e.g. Kate or Konsole they are rectangles. doesn't even show the Unicode number
[12:18:04] <Haohmaru> have you checked what font you're using in Konsole?
[12:18:06] <Haohmaru> or Kate
[12:19:36] <Psy-Q> that shouldn't matter, it should fall back to the emoji fonts (at least it does on sid, but this is bullseye)

[12:21:08] <Psy-Q> if i set konsole's whole font to Noto Color Emoji the emoji show, but since those fonts lack most other characters... :)
[12:21:11] <Haohmaru> okay maybe it's the other font's fault, what font have you actually selected?

[12:27:08] <Psy-Q> ah, perfect! OK, then it really is only Qt related
[12:27:17] <Khepra> Haohmaru: that's rsyslog storing daemon.* facility messages by default. methinks, yes, systemd will put certain service contexts into daemon facility when forwarding to syslog
[12:27:33] <jelly> perhaps konsole does not do font substitution at all?
[12:28:10] <Haohmaru> i don't know how this works but maybe it could be the fault of whatever library is responsible for dealing with the font

[12:45:51] <Haohmaru> Khepra yes, the askubuntu result is the first result
[12:46:01] <Psy-Q> something like that, if there are fonts with "deep" style lists, Qt somehow doesn't manage to fall back to the low-priority fallback fonts that have the emoji in them

[16:07:45] <Haohmaru> seems there are different "formats" of bitmap fonts on linux, i don't know the details, but they are all eventually bitmap fonts, not vector ones.. in text-mode you're using bitmap fonts

[16:12:28] <jelly> Tahoma 11px, the font you use on windows for menus, used to look very crisp in Linux apps before harfbuzz, arguably better than on windows

[16:17:18] <Haohmaru> there's this one issue with LCDs and displays in general which nobody wants to consider, many displays are kinda wrong and thus that affects any "antialiasing" or image reconstruction, expecially vector fonts/graphics at small sizes

[22:24:58] <sney> there was a transition issue with gcc-8 going to gcc-10 during the bullseye testing cycle. I don't think you can have both of them on one system for that reason
[22:25:27] <sney> but if you only need 8, removing 10 and making sure to downgrade libgcc1 *should* make it work? I think?

[22:27:07] <somiaj> or what do you need gcc-8 for, would fixing the source so gcc-10 works be a better approach here?
[22:27:53] <rsarson> sney:  that's what i'm learning.  it's not big deal, the only reason i'm doing this is simply to compare versions of gcc.  i successfully installed gcc-6 using the same method with the stretch repositories, but failed on gcc-4.9 because the jessie repositories no longer work (i looked at archives, snapshots, etc... but ugh!).  i actually installed debian 10 in virtualbox, so i am able to use gcc-8 there.  i was just curious why gcc-8 won
[22:27:53] <rsarson> 't install in debian 11.
[22:28:46] <somiaj> you can get jessie are archive, but here I would suggest using chroots vs installing this in bullseye

[22:39:20] <sney> gcc-8-base doesn't do much, just creates a directory structure in /usr/lib and enforces some dependency requirements common to all gcc-8 packages
[22:40:46] <sney> the general purpose of packages like this is to make sure any requirements are in place for any combination of gcc-X packages, so it doesn't necessarily need to be duplicated across multiple binary packages

[23:49:00] <cryptonector> hi
[23:49:11] <cryptonector> trying to understand package transition (https://wiki.debian.org/PackageTransition)
[23:49:20] <cryptonector> my use case is #7 on that list
[23:49:42] <cryptonector> Split: only A existed; move some files from A to B; new A does not require new B (but B requires A)
[23:51:03] <cryptonector> what must I do?  say that B Breaks and Replaces A?
[23:51:40] <sney> that one is pretty simple, the new split packages break/replace the old version
[23:52:06] <cryptonector> and the << 2 in "Breaks: A (<<2)" needs to be replaced with the last pre-split version of A?
[23:52:17] <sney> right
[23:52:27] <cryptonector> the << stays as <<, just the version?  ok
[23:52:36] <sney> if this is for a package in the debian archive, you will get more specific help in #debian-mentors on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera)
[23:52:50] <cryptonector> hmm, idk if this is in the debian archive
[23:52:54] <cryptonector> how would I check?
[23:53:07] <sney> if it's a package that will be distributed by debian
[23:53:29] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.58.188.114)
[23:54:32] <cryptonector> it's `safeboot`, from safeboot.dev / https://github.com/osresearch/safeboot/tree/master/debian
[23:54:43] <cryptonector> it has packaging, but probably isn't in debian yet
[23:55:14] <AlexLikeRock> i upgrade fuul OS
[23:55:15] <AlexLikeRock> but
[23:55:20] <sney> if the goal is for it to be in debian, then #debian-mentors is still the right channel. for 3rd party repos etc, there is also #packaging. (both are on OFTC.)
[23:55:38] <AlexLikeRock> now "not automount"

[23:56:55] <cryptonector> sney: OFTC?
[23:57:16] <cryptonector> ah, different IRC
[23:57:18] <sney> cryptonector: irc.oftc.net, a different irc network
[23:57:38] *** Joins: xingu (~xingu@user/xingu)
[23:57:43] <cryptonector> y
[23:57:46] <sney> OFTC has been debian's official irc network since 2006. this one (and previously the freenode version) is maintainde for convenience
[23:57:58] <AlexLikeRock> what did i lose ??
[23:57:59] <cryptonector> for us lusers :)
[23:58:08] <cryptonector> thanks @sney!
[23:58:11] <sney> np
