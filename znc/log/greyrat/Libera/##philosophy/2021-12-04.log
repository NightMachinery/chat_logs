[14:42:01] <causative> if I ruled a country, one of the first things I'd do is make it illegal for a manufacturer to intentionally cripple their products
[14:42:52] <causative> if a manufacturer achieves market segmentation by building the full product and then crippling parts of it for the downmarket line, that's always a sign of a monopolistic business model
[14:42:58] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[14:43:21] <causative> because in a competitive market, a competitor could sell the non-crippled model for the same price
[14:43:45] <causative> and monopolistic business models are generally bad for society
[14:44:54] <I_Am_M00t> so no google

[14:45:22] <causative> services are a somewhat different story
[14:45:36] <I_Am_M00t> lol, why tho
[14:45:51] <I_Am_M00t> om nom nom nom google eats small fish
[14:46:10] <causative> because there's an ongoing cost to provide a service
[14:46:39] <causative> it often does make sense - and is competitive - to offer less service for a lower price
[14:47:15] <causative> the concept of "crippling a product" doesn't really make much sense when applied to a service
[14:47:39] <causative> it's just offering less product to begin with
[14:47:44] <causative> which is fine
[14:49:06] <I_Am_M00t> ...
[14:49:09] <causative> when I talk about corporations intentionally crippling their products I am mostly speaking about electronics and software on physical devices sold to the consumer
[14:49:25] <I_Am_M00t> i would revisit that thought
[14:49:29] <causative> e.g. Intel will make a full-featured chip and then disable certain features to sell it downmarket
[14:50:20] <causative> not manufacturing the chip without the features, which would be ok - manufacturing the full chip, then disabling the features
[14:52:18] <causative> I'm also talking about DRM, or the practice of mobile providers charging extra for letting you use your phone as a hotspot
[14:52:35] <causative> and the right to repair

And we don't have enough explicit laws against the bad way to use them, nor adequate ways to prevent it, so they get used the wrong way.

[20:22:08] <DPA> It is so bad, even, that many parts of the legal system also seeks inadequate uses of these tools, of technology.
[20:23:06] <causative> a computer is an extension of your mind, like pen and paper are
[20:23:13] <causative> do we have the right to forbid others from thinking about us?
[20:23:24] <DPA> No
[20:23:27] <audrey> Theoretically, it wouldn¬¥t take much to send the world back to 1970s levels of technology. A few electromagnetic pulses and the destruction of a few satellites would be enough to fry most advanced electronics and make low-earth orbitation impossible for decades.
[20:23:44] <audrey> This is one of the World War III scenarios that military planners get paid big bucks to think about.
[20:24:30] <audrey> So, we are dependent on something that¬¥s actually quite precarious
[20:26:24] <audrey> Not sure where I¬¥m going with this - probably been reading too much about techno-dystopia.
[20:26:58] <DPA> We need a sense of ethics for technology, we need boundaries, and we need the legal systems to provide ways for people to enforce them, without needing anything like money, without having to worry about anything, and without exceptions.
[20:27:45] <DPA> The scary thing about technology is, if it is not regulated, it is the rules.
[20:29:42] <causative> if computers are an extension of the mind, to regulate them is to regulate what people are allowed to think
[20:29:43] <audrey> I¬¥m highly skeptical of attempts to regulate technology - not because of the usual libertarian talking points, but simply because technological advances so quickly become monolithic that they simply eclipse any ethical or choice-oriented considerations.
[20:30:42] <audrey> Kaczynski gives the example of the automobile - as the entire layout of cities and nations became dependent on an automobile for survival, at a certain point it became irrelevant whether or not you made a free choice to own an automobile: you *had* to own one to prosper, thus setting up a Hobson¬¥s choice after-the-fact.
[20:31:27] <audrey> The same dynamic is now being played out with smartphones. My housemate, a bit of a Luddite, refuses to give up her ¬´dumb¬ª flip phone, but over the years I¬¥ve observed how it¬¥s become more and more difficult for her to do so.
[20:33:02] <DPA> There are may regulations regarding technology. There are regulations of different kinds. Some just standardize or limit some technical aspects of specific technologies. Some are to ensure competitiveness. But some limit what people can do.
[20:33:02] <DPA> We shouldn't limit what people can do. But we should limit how big companies and the state can use technology against us.
[20:33:47] <DPA> We need regulations - the right kind of regulations.

[20:37:31] <DPA> It's also not necessarily that we have to specify a technology to limit, but a use case. Like, we have laws against shooting or cutting people, but I doubt there is a law explicitly saying that, instead, we say we mustn't harm them.

[20:38:09] <causative> and they should be legal too
[20:38:48] <causative> economic competition in a market with low barriers to entry is both legal and moral
[20:39:14] <causative> another legal and moral way to harm people, is to criticize them for what you think they did wrong

[20:39:40] <causative> another legal way to harm people is to sue them - which is sometimes moral

[20:47:31] <DPA> Even if we don't regulate what can be done with technology, we absolutely must make laws of what we must be able to do, or else, we will lose the option.
[20:48:10] <arryana> you're making me glad i kept my 70's truck, audrey
[20:48:31] <causative> DPA, those things should be illegal
[20:48:35] <causative> all the examples you gave
[20:48:39] <DPA> Exactly
[20:48:42] <causative> it should be illegal to put constraints on hardware you bought like that
[20:49:02] <causative> because your computer is an extension of your mind, and we should not have corporations controlling our minds
[20:49:05] <audrey> arryana: It¬¥s kind of unnerving to think just how easily 21st century society could be unraveled
[20:49:34] <tomathy> if they can hack our brains, our brains can hack them
[20:49:57] <arryana> well, it fusses me less than it might, i remember the 70s
[20:50:02] <causative> it could be justified to put constraints on where we put our *eyes* - i.e. prohibit cameras in certain places
[20:50:10] <DPA> And yet, making these constraints illegal, are regulations too.
[20:50:13] <causative> but the information processing of that data is just thought
[20:50:13] <audrey> If you detonate a fairly large (~2 megaton) nuclear warhead in the exosphere over Kansas, you can melt almost all electronics in North America
[20:50:31] <audrey> I¬¥m sure Russia and China have plans drawn up for this in the event of WWIII
[20:50:34] <causative> DPA, the computer you bought should not be an extension of the *corporation's* mind
[20:50:35] <audrey> (And the US, likewise)
[20:50:38] <causative> it should be an extension of *your* mind
[20:50:53] <arryana> it wouldn't break my heart to go back to that lifestyle, i never moved all that far from it
[20:50:54] <causative> so it makes perfect sense to say that the corporation should not be allowed to limit your mind

[20:53:03] <tomathy> because i am ordering a pizza, and i dont want it to be now, i want the pizza
[20:53:07] <causative> but at the same time, surveillance and marketing insights are the corporation's mind, and it has a right to think whatever it wants
[20:53:41] <causative> it has a right to draw together data from the sources available to it to make the conclusions that seem reasonable to it - the same right as everyone has, just larger-scale
[20:54:39] <causative> we need more truth in society, not less.  Corporate surveillance and marketing analytic, as much as you may not like it, is a way for corporations to find out truths about their customers
[20:55:16] <causative> the only problem is that it's not two-way, i.e. customers need better facilities to monitor what corporations are doing
[20:57:09] <causative> human culture is a world-spanning mind and we want the world-mind to be smarter
[20:58:04] <causative> this can be taken as the only moral good - the promotion of higher sapience
[20:58:15] <causative> ot
[20:58:34] <causative> our higher sapience is the only thing that morally privileges humans over plants or animals

[21:17:35] <causative> DPA, I think any system can be understood as some sort of mind, perhaps only a simple one
[21:18:09] <causative> but in particular a massive information system is a way to *augment* the minds of actual people - marketers, for instance

[21:26:55] <causative> the leaders don't know everything the company is doing
[21:27:03] <causative> and they depend for their decisions on many subordinates
[21:27:23] <causative> and the actual policy and major decisions may be the result of a vote of the board of directors, not a single person
[21:27:42] <DPA> While the people in a company can help inform decisions in a company, and open up new pathways, in the end, they still do not make the final decisions.
[21:28:01] <causative> unless they're on the board of directors
[21:28:43] <causative> if they aren't on the board of directors, then their actions may be viewable as extensions of the board's collective mind - contributing their expertise and knowledge when necessary to improve the decisions the board makes

[21:29:54] <tomathy> can i tell you guys a dream i had
[21:29:59] <causative> when things are working well, the corporation acts as if it has the expertise of all of its experts combined, taking the right action at the right time in a way that no individual would be able to match
[21:30:02] <audrey> arryana: My uncle (now deceased) used to work on cars for a living. Somewhere around the year 2006 the cars became so complicated, due to all the computer chips in them, that he couldn¬¥t work on them and he had to *pay money* to a computer specialist to diagnose issues that he used to be able to just fix with a wrench. It really hurt his business.

[21:31:33] <tomathy> i had a really unusual dream that shed some light on the nature of time
[21:32:14] <DPA> To get the best average accuracy for decisions & predictions, it's usually necessary to have an even distribution of people both experts and not in any field. When there are too many experts, the result can worsen too,
[21:32:42] <tomathy> i was doing something i really enjoy in the dream, and more time passed the more i enjoyed it

[21:36:56] <DPA> > Scott E. Page introduced the diversity prediction theorem: "The squared error of the collective prediction equals the average squared error minus the predictive diversity". Therefore, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small.
[21:37:06] <arryana> these days, new cars... that's not the question anymore

[21:39:15] <DPA> That tends to be unusual for a company. There are jobs, people are hired for similar tasks / skills, so they have some significant overlap in their background.
[21:39:26] <causative> diversity matters to the extent that each person knows something the others do not
[21:39:37] <causative> so they can each contribute additional information that was not already there
[21:39:52] <causative> if there's a "layman," what additional information can he contribute, that an expert couldn't?
[21:40:16] <DPA> If you have someone way overestimating something, and someone doing the opposite, it can average out to about the right thing.
[21:40:43] <DPA> It's not neccessary for anyone to be accurate
[21:41:33] <causative> and in this scenario would you expect the expert to overestimate, or underestimate the true figure?
[21:41:44] <causative> and again answer for the layman
[21:42:43] <causative> we can't say the expert would overestimate or underestimate - they could do either, and so could the layman.  But we'd expect the expert to be closer to the true figure, so the layman's ignorant guess would just pull it in a random direction
[21:43:10] <DPA> The layman will be worse individually, but it should average out, provided they are not influenced.
[21:44:16] <DPA> This has been used in the past to determine search areas, when experts on the matter wouldn't have been accurate enough.
[21:44:36] <causative> cite?
[21:45:04] <causative> in machine learning this is called "ensemble learning" where several different models are averaged to get a final answer, and it's well accepted that the reason it works, is that each model contributes some unique information the others do not
[21:45:17] <causative> if there's a model that has nothing the other models don't also have - then that model does not improve the ensemble

[21:48:08] <audrey> arryana, this is why I¬¥ve developed a taste for small-displacement motorbikes
[21:48:21] <audrey> there is very little with them you can¬¥t solve with a wrench or a drill
[21:48:35] * arryana nods
[21:49:00] <arryana> i have an eye on a refit vespa scooter, they've turned a vintage one electric

[21:49:53] <audrey> I want to get my proper motorcycle license soon so I can buy a bigger bike in the 300cc range, something used
[21:49:58] <audrey> and then I want to take it cross country
[21:50:05] <arryana> i envy that
[21:50:09] <audrey> I can take my Roughhouse cross country but it really struggles with anything over 45mph
[21:50:18] <arryana> i'm not big enough to ride a bike like that, in reality
[21:50:36] <audrey> I¬¥ve seen some small ladies on some big bikes before!
[21:50:44] <audrey> though I guess it¬¥s easy for me to talk
[21:50:47] <arryana> yeah, but i have two reconstructed ankles
[21:50:52] <arryana> and i'm not quite 5'2
[21:50:56] <audrey> if I don¬¥t like how I parked my bike I just lift it up and move it around
[21:50:59] <arryana> if i put the thing down, i'd never get it back up
[21:51:10] <audrey> tends to draw stares from people lol
[21:51:16] <arryana> i still envy it
[21:51:33] <arryana> the average 12 year old girl is bigger than i am
[21:52:31] <arryana> next lifetime i'll be taller, maybe
[21:54:32] <audrey> well finding good fitting clothes is a challenge
[21:54:44] <arryana> i bet
[21:54:49] <audrey> I¬¥m a size small horizontally but a size large vertically
[21:54:52] <arryana> haha
[21:55:02] <audrey> and they don¬¥t make clothes like that unless you buy expensive stuff meant for models
[21:55:07] <arryana> yeah
[21:55:11] <arryana> or vintage
[21:55:24] <audrey> also I hate how all the tops they sell these days have HUGE cut-outs in front
[21:55:42] <audrey> clearly meant for very overweight people
[21:55:52] <audrey> or with *cough* very large assets
[21:55:57] <arryana> yeah, that doesn't really work for short people either
[21:56:20] <audrey> I try to buy European brands which don¬¥t have this problem
[21:56:23] <audrey> but that¬¥s expensive
[21:56:35] <arryana> saying that, i don't really wear anything that 'fits', just flappy hippy sorts of things
[21:56:54] <audrey> I¬¥m a sucker for tight fitting clothing, LOL
[21:57:01] <audrey> if I could wear a catsuit, I would
[21:57:05] <arryana> haha
[21:57:18] <arryana> i don't see why not.
[21:58:19] <arryana> for me it's just utilitarian, and most of what i wear i've had for years.
[21:58:41] <pussipupu> If I could get away with wearing a quokka onesie I would
[21:59:00] <audrey> Well, the issue is that catsuits in the US have a *cough* reputation
[21:59:09] <arryana> hahah
[21:59:17] * arryana starts crocheting a quokka onesie
[21:59:30] <arryana> yeah.  i hate that clothing carries assumptions like that
[21:59:31] <audrey> and while I¬¥m okay with that in certain contexts it¬¥s certainly not the vibe I want to give most of the time
[21:59:49] <audrey> bad enough that so many men fetishize tall women >.<
[22:00:16] <arryana> i wore a forrest-gump sort of leg brace for so many years, wide flappy legged stuff was the obvious option
[22:00:36] <arryana> and i just never lost the habit after i ditched the brace
[22:01:10] <audrey> Anyway I think I¬¥ll go out to the wildlife preserve out of town this afternoon
[22:01:12] <biys> i uh... don't disagree.  Twitter is an odd platform to me.  always has been. always will be
[22:01:35] <biys> i also have an attention span longer than 2 seconds when it comes to reading
[22:01:39] <audrey> It¬¥s supposed to be warm out today.
[22:01:45] <biys> so i'm not `put off' by a 1,000 page book
[22:01:48] <audrey> if I¬¥d gotten an earlier start I would have gone to the coast
[22:01:49] <arryana> ooh
[22:01:56] <arryana> wildlife preserves are marvelous
[22:02:01] <audrey> biys: sorry, can you say that again in 20 characters or less
[22:02:02] <audrey> ;)
[22:02:29] <audrey> Maybe I¬¥ll go to the coast tomorrow.
