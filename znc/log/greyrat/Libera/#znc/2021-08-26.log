[18:29:57] <DoctorD90> if I setup the SASL module to refuse the connection if not authenticated I cant login...so what is the pourpose of SASL external if I could log without the SASL module? only with the certificate?

[18:37:16] <jm18> DoctorD90 without sasl you will not authenticate until after you connect whereas with sasl you authenticate at the start of the connection process 
[18:37:52] <Khaytsus> Certificate > SASL > External authentication > nickserv authentication
[18:38:21] <Casper> Certificate > SASL > External authentication > nickserv cert authentication > nickserv identify authentication
[18:38:45] <Khaytsus> Didn't know you could nickserv cert, but I pretty much discount talking to nickserv at all
[18:39:32] <Casper> Khaytsus: /ns help cert
[18:39:39] <Khaytsus> I trust what you're saying ;)
[18:39:48] <Khaytsus> Just saying......  no heh
[18:39:49] <Casper> It'll auth you on your certificate, like SASL, but then later in the process :P
[18:40:03] <Casper> SASL is always the best option at least :P

[18:40:35] <Khaytsus> Is the certificate (during connection process) part of SASL or independent, I'm not sure
[18:40:46] <Khaytsus> Always hear them kind of tied together but 
[18:41:44] <Casper> Khaytsus, that's SASL EXTERNAL, which is part of SASL. 
[18:41:54] <DoctorD90> but in that case, it wouldnt be: sasl external+cert > sasl plan (via ssl) > certificate > others (i only know senting user+pass, nickserv and as last, perform xD)
[18:42:21] <Khaytsus> DoctorD90: You just restated what we did, but wrongly
[18:42:23] <Khaytsus> but okay
[18:42:30] <Casper> So; SASL EXTERNAL (cert) > SASL PLAIN (username/password) > Nickserv cert > Nickserv identify? I think.
[18:42:45] <DoctorD90> sorry Khaytsus why wrongly?
[18:43:15] <DoctorD90> casper but in that case what is the differnece between the sasl external configuration and the simple cert?
[18:43:26] <DoctorD90> maybe that's my missing point
[18:43:37] <Casper> DoctorD90, sasl external is during connection, nickserv cert does it after you've already connected.

[18:44:29] <DoctorD90> then how is it possible that i got refused the auth before to login on a server? I had to fla requiredauth no
[18:44:32] <DoctorD90> otherwise it failed
[18:44:42] <Casper> DoctorD90, their SASL configuration is bad.
[18:44:45] <Casper> Or their timeout is too short.
[18:44:48] <DoctorD90> ah ok
[18:45:03] <Casper> If nickserv is not available, SASL will fail, because it does require services to be present to negotiate the authentication with.
[18:45:09] <DoctorD90> so it is some mistake from their side.....ok that explain me everything
[18:45:37] <Casper> Possibly, or your configuration (cert or user/pass) is wrong.
[18:45:42] <DoctorD90> well...I think I have to report it to oftc guys then :P
[18:45:50] <Casper> OFTC doesn't have SASL.
[18:45:52] <DoctorD90> ok then I will check my own first
[18:46:07] <DoctorD90> 0o yes they have 0o .....doubt is raising
[18:46:13] <Casper> https://www.oftc.net/FAQ/Services/ search for "Do you provide SASL?"
[18:46:15] <Casper> No they don't.
[18:46:30] <Casper> (yet)
[18:46:59] <DoctorD90> Do you provide SASL?
[18:46:59] <DoctorD90> Not yet, please use CertFP as described below. SASL is on the Roadmap though.
[18:47:03] <Khaytsus> It amazes me that OFTC doesn't have SASL.  Seriously does.  I have no reason to be on OFTC anyway.
[18:47:04] <DoctorD90> yeah, i find out the same

[18:50:40] <DoctorD90> owell...then without the requiredauth, it "failed" sasl and directly went to cert module. once i forced the sasl with required auth yes it failed at all. ok, thank you very much for the explanaition. Everythin popup due to oftc xD thanks!

[19:15:58] <Khaytsus> Why the intermediate?
[19:17:29] <DoctorD90> solanum is a new ircd service?
[19:18:44] <l> DoctorD90: yes, it’s the one libera uses
[19:19:10] <l> it’s still a WIP feature wise but it’s very stable
[19:19:26] <l> it’s built off the charybdis ircd
[19:20:02] <DoctorD90> well...im happy...it is 2021...if irc wouldnt update their services, it would disappear :) really happy that the scene is still active!

[19:28:53] <Casper> Khaytsus, nothing wrong with first migrating to a different services package and then switching IRCd :p 
[19:29:04] <Casper> More chance of borkings when you do them at the same time.
[19:29:09] <Khaytsus> Fair
[19:29:16] <Casper> Eh, higher* chance.
[19:29:19] <Casper> More chance doesn't sound right.
[19:29:27] <Khaytsus> So it's not okay if you just burn everything down repeatedly?

[19:29:45] <Casper> If you want to go from 70k to 1.7k users, definitely the right way.

[20:06:08] <codebam> does connecting to znc over port 443 not work?
[20:06:21] <codebam> I can't seem to connect, but maybe my reverse proxy is making it not work
[20:14:35] <jm18> sounds like the problem is your proxy configuration... it would be simpler to skip the proxy and just connect to znc
