[00:33:09] <la_croix_> Are there anybody in who knows about the interaction between pytest-django (+django.test.utils) and psycopg2? I am using the __init__ method of a field's metaclass to create a type in the db. This works fine through shell, or runserver, but fails on pytest. It looks as though pytest is running the __init__, then creating the test database, I just don't know how to fix it

[01:08:46] <nbjoerg> la_croix_: use the pytest.mark.django_db fixture to explicitly add it?
[01:09:52] <nbjoerg> I would expect you can run into issues with non-default databases too
[01:14:47] <la_croix_> nbjoerg: I was under the impression that that allowed the test to use the database, but not to modify run a SQL command before the tests start?
[01:15:03] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigibu@80.30.201.209)
[01:19:14] <nbjoerg> btw, why do you not have an actual migration for that type?
[01:19:23] <nbjoerg> instead of doing it in __init__?
[01:21:25] *** Joins: abrantesasf (~abrantesa@187.36.170.211)
[01:23:02] <la_croix_> I tried that, and it did work, with the conversion to/from the type happening in the to_python/db_prep_value method. Then I decided to be clever * :( * and register the type with psycopg2 itself, so that it could adapt to/from the type automatically. This works really nicely, just not in tests: https://dpaste.org/epiii
[01:24:02] <la_croix_> https://dpaste.org/epii , sorry
[01:25:01] <nbjoerg> line 18 is using django.db.connection?
[01:25:49] <la_croix_> nbjoerg: Yeah, it's a regular django (postgres) database, using the regular django db system, I'm just adding a type to it
[01:26:50] <nbjoerg> what about using db_check instead?
[01:27:08] <nbjoerg> hm.

[01:31:48] <la_croix_> In django or pytest?
[01:32:31] <nbjoerg> in django
[01:32:48] <nbjoerg> I would hope the same works for pytest
[01:33:11] <la_croix_> I've put a bunch of debug statements it, it looks as though it runs the init method and then creates the test database (meaning that the init method is never run on the new test database). I did find a comment somewhere on a pytest-django ticket (which I now can't find), that suggested that __init__ methods suffered from this, but it didn;'t say how to fix it
[01:33:31] *** Joins: LuxuryMode (uid91005@ilkley.irccloud.com)
[01:34:10] <la_croix_> i could do it with a system level fixture, if it weren't for the fact that it needs to exist _before_ the test database is migrated. It would be helpful if pytest-django had a pre_migrate hook

[01:35:26] <LuxuryMode> Trying to upgrade to Django 3.2 from 3.1 and Django is wanting to create a migration for one of my dependencies `/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/great-control-QJlTk0kd-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/impersonate/migrations/0002_alter_impersonationlog_id.py` which is confusing me. Any ideas on what is going on herE?
[01:36:13] <nbjoerg> la_croix_: see django.contrib.postgres.apps
[01:37:41] <tga> quick poll: are you running your own databases in production or using managed?
[01:38:06] * tga is looking at various providers for a good vps/container + managed database + s3 combo
[01:38:56] <nbjoerg> running the database is easy compared to most other parts
[01:40:16] <tga> is it?
[01:40:52] <tga> most of my persistent data is in the database, so it needs to be always on, replicated, backed up
[01:41:21] <tga> on the compute nodes I run docker swarm, either standalone or through caprover, they are basically disposable
[01:42:40] <tga> I don't have a lot of static files, so my experience with S3 is limited. so far I've been using managed and not cared much beyond daily backups

[13:03:16] <pycode> so the question is, should i create a view that return the form html so i can then use fetch to load that content?

[19:00:42] <pycode> I add print(self.request.POST)
[19:00:46] <pycode> one moment
[19:01:53] <pycode> GinFuyou, https://bpa.st/4SHQ
[19:02:22] <pycode> 'contract' is the SUBMIT input i add that name because i was thibking to detect which form has been sent
[19:02:32] <pycode> however as you see there is contract-billing_email
[19:02:37] <pycode> i see the prefix "contract"
[19:04:31] <pycode> GinFuyou,  https://bpa.st/OXEA
[19:04:40] <pycode> for some reason it creates a new instance!?!?
[19:06:41] <pycode> the kwargs i am passing to the form class are correct: https://bpa.st/RJGA
[19:06:43] <GinFuyou> ah I think I got it
[19:06:49] <pycode> as you can see there is the "instance"
[19:06:55] <GinFuyou> You don't set initial in kwargs
[19:07:05] <pycode> no i dont
[19:07:08] <GinFuyou> so all data you send in post are set
[19:07:23] <GinFuyou> everything that is not in POST becomes None
[19:07:37] <pycode> so what can i do? initial = {} ?
[19:08:00] <GinFuyou> kwargs = {'initial': self.get_initial(), <...>}

[19:08:20] <GinFuyou> actually
[19:08:23] <pycode> i do not have get_initial() method...however should be empty?
[19:08:33] <GinFuyou> Why do you have overriden get_form_kwargs?
[19:08:41] <pycode> i thought that passing an existant instance was enough
[19:08:43] <GinFuyou> If you comment it - it should work
[19:08:58] <pycode> GinFuyou, because it is a "custom" CBV
[19:09:03] <pycode> because i am dealing with two forms
[19:09:08] <pycode> it is a TemplateView
[19:09:27] <GinFuyou> Oh, you are basing on TemplateView
[19:09:27] <pycode> GinFuyou, whole class: https://bpa.st/ACHA
[19:09:37] <GinFuyou> Wouldn't recommend that
[19:09:44] <pycode> yes because i did not find and built-in
[19:09:53] <pycode> for two or more forms
[19:10:11] <pycode> *i did not found any built-in CBV to deal with two or more forms
[19:10:57] <pycode> because i need to handle two form_valid two form_invalid etc
[19:11:13] <pycode> how could i do?
[19:12:47] <GinFuyou> Oh, Bob had a guide for a FBV https://blog.tinbrain.net/blog/updating-two-models-single-post.html
[19:13:17] <pycode> i need to update the same model (same instance)
[19:13:37] <GinFuyou> Well, it doesn't make much difference.
[19:13:42] <pycode> and NOT "at the same time" (with the same requesT)
[19:14:11] <GinFuyou> ah, you submit those separately?
[19:14:28] <pycode> GinFuyou, exactly..
[19:14:31] <pycode> i have on the same page
[19:14:33] <pycode> two forms
[19:14:41] <pycode> one just update the "billing_Email" field
[19:14:52] <pycode> and another all fields
[19:14:56] <GinFuyou> Sorry, I've assumed wrong then... but it doesn't really matter that much
[19:15:09] <GinFuyou> give a moment
[19:15:35] <pycode> as you can see in the article it is passing two different instances because the model are different
[19:15:36] <pycode> ok

[19:18:39] <GinFuyou> it's just more common case, if it's same model it doesn't make much difference
[19:18:54] <GinFuyou> https://bpa.st/WCQA hm, probably this will already work? (not sure)
[19:19:32] <pycode> there is no get_form_kwargs
[19:19:40] <pycode> templateview has no get_form_kwargsmethod
[19:19:46] <GinFuyou> there is, in CreateView
[19:19:58] <GinFuyou> I've changed base class
[19:20:14] <GinFuyou> lines 1 and 4
[19:20:19] <pycode> i already have the instance so i suppose it is an Editview no?
[19:21:02] <GinFuyou> yes that makes sense, but both should work
[19:21:17] <GinFuyou> could use UpdateView view
[19:22:10] <GinFuyou> ah, there is a catch after all, it doesn't take prefix
[19:22:35] <pycode> Using ModelFormMixin (base class of OfferView) without the 'fields' attribute is prohibited.
[19:25:35] <GinFuyou> https://bpa.st/ILGA
[19:26:02] <GinFuyou> form_class = OfferForm
[19:26:19] <GinFuyou> add this, should remove this error, doesn't matter
[19:28:03] <pycode> self.object is None
[19:28:04] <pycode> hmm
[19:30:04] <pycode> GinFuyou, it is really strange that there is no CBV that supports two forms....

[19:39:45] <pycode> i basically pass the data if i need to work with the form...
[19:40:12] <pycode> then my submits are:

[19:43:22] <pycode> GinFuyou, the price could be overwritten on the offerform
[19:43:27] <pycode> the problem here is the smaller form
[19:43:30] <pycode> that only has one form
[19:43:50] <pycode> if i send that form and execute the check on the other first will give me the problem we were talking about
[19:43:59] <pycode> so that way...    1. i just run the form i need
[19:44:10] <pycode> (there is no 2 point) :D
[19:45:45] <GinFuyou> nope, earlier tests showed problem was not with second form, or did I get that wrong?
