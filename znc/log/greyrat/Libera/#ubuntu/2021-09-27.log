[00:01:53] <TJ-> I tend to remember concepts rather than the exact syntax (I know it can be done, and can visualise the solution in almost any programming language or tool, but not the exact syntax or exact option name), so end up rediscovering code from old programs, and command options from man-pages

[00:05:29] <ramblebamble> Thankfully, that is something I can only imagine
[00:05:51] <ramblebamble> When you say packages, are we talking about apt-packages?
[00:06:20] <TJ-> ramblebamble: yes; all Debian/Ubuntu packages
[00:06:37] <TJ-> ramblebamble: also some projects I'm on the process of packaging for Debian

[00:10:06] <croraf_> only this skype that is causing problem has this permission -rw-------
[00:10:51] <croraf_> So I guess I just have to change that file to have the same permission?
[00:11:39] <tomreyn> croraf_: you can then just    sudo chmod 644     this file. but you'll also need to change file ownership, i assume

[00:27:55] <tomreyn> croraf_: the packages now listed at the given URL are not available from any of your configured apt repositories. these packages should probably be removed unless you know you need to keep them. those you want to keep, you should find a comptable (to your ubuntu release) apt repository for, and configure this.

[10:24:43] <alkisg> Guest6748: no, you can't expect application developers to be available on chat 24/7, you need to use bug trackers. But are you certain that this is a bug? You can discuss it here before reporting it...

[11:50:23] <nikolam> Hi, I am on 21.04 Xubuntu and having one monitor connected to DiplayPort to HDMI cable (DP on 4600HD i5 4570 on HP 600G1 TWR) and another monitor on VGA output. Problem is that , while in GRUB, when I go and select menus with keyboard cursors, meny selection gets _desinchronised_ between two monitors!
[11:51:01] <nikolam> E.G. refreshing the picture on DP output ot HDMI monitor lags behind 5+ seconds after the VGA monitor..

[15:51:39] <alterjsive> ok thanks
[15:51:49] <jushur> actually it depends, if it is compiled with the same src and settings, and say enabling a module it would be fine. if you change src in any way your out on thinner ice..

[19:18:02] <ubottu> In Python before 3,9,5, the ipaddress library mishandles leading zero characters in the octets of an IP address string. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29921>

[19:30:01] <ubottu> Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3177>

[21:48:41] <minimec> Ali_nz: There is the possibility to boot the installer USB medium and use 'chroot' to execute tasks on the existing installation on the computer. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery
[21:49:37] <Ali_nz> Well I tried to boot the live CD, and all the options except something else said they would wipe the existing disk, there wasnt an option to install "over the top" so to speak where it would keep files
[21:50:37] <minimec> Ali_nz: You just use 'Try Ubuntu' and boot in to the graphical interface.

[21:51:48] <Ali_nz> the reason my install is borked is because I tried to install VMWare which needed me to follow these instructions to work with secure boot: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1096052/vmware-15-error-on-ubuntu-18-4-could-not-open-dev-vmmon-no-such-file-or-dire - i got to the reoboot step and got the blue screen and installed the key - but then it wont boot - black screen
[21:52:03] <Ali_nz> minimec: I dont want to try - I need reinstall
[21:53:36] <minimec> Ali_nz: In case you have a blackscreen on boot try to use the 'recovery mode' boot procedure 'Advanced options for Ubuntu'. Do you have an Nvidia GPU?
[21:54:16] <minimec> Ali_nz: 'chroot' mode would allow you to fix a broken system that is installed on your computer without overwriting it with a reinstallation.
