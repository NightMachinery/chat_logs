[00:19:02] <zebrask> Where do US people get modafinil these days, other than convincing a doctor to give them some?
[00:19:31] <zebrask> Darknet markets? Online pharmacies? Are any of those particularly reputable?
[00:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: buymoda, sharkmood
[00:20:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Different in what way?
[00:21:09] <adiabatic> Stronger. The yolk was way more orange and more flavorful. I actually didn't like them all that much, they were so strong.
[00:21:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Huh
[00:21:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think I know what it even means for an egg to taste "stronger"
[00:21:33] <kuudes> what are current russian and ukrainian negotion positions?
[00:22:03] <adiabatic> like, the yolks had flavors in them that were both generally stronger and not present in normie yolks
[00:22:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Weird
[00:22:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now I want to try some such eggs!
[00:22:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> OH btw
[00:22:40] <zebrask> Obormot\Arcturus: Thanks.
[00:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I tried the Serious Eats imitation Egg McMuffin recioe
[00:22:45] * gwern has had duck eggs. those were fun
[00:22:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> *recipe
[00:23:02] <zebrask> These things take standard credit cards. Is that wise?
[00:23:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Didn't use actual English muffins (who keeps those around? not me) but instead used my sourdough bread
[00:23:14] <zebrask> Or rather, is it wise to use one's credit cards for that?
[00:23:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Use btc, it's cheaper anyhow (discount by like 20%)
[00:23:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I've made it twice now. Came out delicious.
[00:23:48] <ggreer> the eggs probably taste different because of what the chickens ate
[00:24:05] <zebrask> Well now I have to figure out how to access an unencrypted wallet.dat file from qbitcoin circa ~2014.
[00:24:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Or... make a coinbase account
[00:24:20] <adiabatic> zebrask: that sounds like a fun project
[00:25:33] <saturn2> paying directly from coinbase is probably less safe than just using a credit card
[00:26:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: How do you figure that
[00:26:02] <ggreer> most sites charge way more for credit card purchases since customers can dispute the charge after the package ships
[00:26:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah as I said, it's a 20% crypto discount usually
[00:26:23] <zebrask> Obormot\Arcturus: Well I think I have $15k in BTC sitting in that wallet.
[00:26:39] <zebrask> So I figure I should probably get it out at some point anyway.
[00:26:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Uh, ok, fair enough, well it sounds like you should get hold of that regardless of any modafinil purchases you may or may not make...
[00:27:01] <zebrask> Sounds like everyone is saying to download bitcoin core and sync the blockchain, which will take 500GB of disk drive space and take several days.
[00:27:03] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: in terms of being surveilled by the financial powers that be. obviously you still get the discount
[00:27:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh. Is that a worry? I can see caring about surveillance by USG, but that comes from having the stuff shipped to you rather than how you pay, usually...
[00:29:31] <saturn2> opinions differ
[00:29:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough I guess
[00:31:19] <zebrask> Presumably you could make the case that someone shipped it to you against your will,
[00:32:02] <zebrask> Whereas your credit card records and/or Coinbase's KYC rules would presumably make it less plausible.
[00:35:12] <saturn2> it was safe to donate to anti-vax protestors in canada until it retroactively wasn't
[00:36:06] <saturn2> plenty of people view unapproved modafinil use as similarly morally unacceptable
[00:36:19] <gwern> at least they're unfrozen now, I think? and how many peoplpe got fired in the end? just that one politician's employee wasn't it?

[05:09:27] <ggreer> > If a fission device designed for boosting is tested without the boost gas, a yield in the sub-kiloton range may indicate a successful test that the device's implosion and primary fission stages are working as designed, though this does not test the boosting process itself.

[06:09:42] <ardent[m]> funny that back then starting up a gmail account was free, quick, and anonymous

[06:10:42] <PapuaHardyNet> ardent[m]: just ask someone with an android phone to make a gmail account. not much verification
[06:10:43] <gwern> it was never anonymous. they always recorded at least the initial IP indefinitely
[06:10:48] <PapuaHardyNet> heck I can make more for you
[06:11:05] <ardent[m]> in the context that you are using tor browser bundle it was
[06:11:19] <gwern> gmail let you register an account through tor?
[06:13:10] <ardent[m]> I believe so, I'm operating off my memory of rereading something saved on my other boot
[06:14:36] <gwern> I am very skeptical. maybe early on but by 2011? people wouldn't've been using tormail etc if gmail worked flawlessly from beginning to end
[06:17:09] <ardent[m]> "Low-grade anonymous email can effectively be achieved by creating a Yahoo or gmail account and only accessing it through Tor.

[06:17:38] <ardent[m]> can't check the history of that page because I only saved the contents not the history or talk
[06:17:48] <PapuaHardyNet> hold on, so sending an email using a native email client means I've already doxxed myself?
[06:19:00] <ardent[m]> the guide is called How to Exit the Matrix
[06:19:40] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao I just checked the email headers, yeah it leaks IP. I'm embarrassed I didn't remember this
[06:21:01] <ggreer> I've created multiple icloud & gmail accounts from burner phones and/or tor. over the years all of them have gone into verification hell. they want a real phone number, photo of an id, etc. these are accounts that I only used to sign up for other services. I'm guessing since I never sent or received emails to real people, their anti-spam software flagged them
[06:21:41] <ardent[m]> Oh ok the gmail paragraph hasn't been modified since 2006

[06:23:30] <ardent[m]> so yeah @gwern looks like you were right, the doc was already a few years old when I viewed it
[06:26:53] <gwern> (can't just believe everything you read, y'know. gotta ask if it makes sense given incentives and everything else about the world. would you *predict* that google would make gmail trivial to use for terrorists, child pornographers, spammers, DNM users etc?)
[06:27:09] <ardent[m]> 2011 was a long time ago
[06:28:27] <gwern> as far as that kind of abuse goes, it was but yesterday. in many ways, things like terrorism were much more salient
[06:29:01] <ardent[m]> Ah ok valid, was mostly thinking from a lens of modern censorship, e.g. Reddit only banned very few subs until 2015
[06:47:16] <gwern> reddit was founded by free speech types, which was why the DNM subreddits flourished there instead of anywhere else

[13:28:56] <quanticle> No mention of Rob Lee? Disappointing
[13:29:25] <quanticle> Rob Lee and Dmitri Alperovitch have been saying that Russia was going to invade since last December
[13:30:09] <quanticle> Oh, Dmitri Alperovitch is there
[13:31:34] <quanticle> I will say that basically no one predicted that things would go as badly as they have for the "conventional" part of the campaign. 
[13:35:15] <PlanckWalk> Have they gone particularly badly?
[13:36:05] <PlanckWalk> I've seen a lot of anecotes that suggest so, but not a lot of data with weight.
[13:36:25] <enterprisey> presumably the data is that kyiv hasn't fallen
[13:37:30] <PlanckWalk> Not having captured the capital within about a week doesn't seem particularly terrible performance.
[13:37:40] <PlanckWalk> (Even if it is unusually close to the border)
[13:41:12] <PlanckWalk> As in, was there a reason to expect it to fall in 1/3 the time it took to occupy Baghdad?
[13:42:24] <capisce> the Americans planned to take their time, didn't they?

[15:28:28] <Robomot> Flies Possess More Sophisticated Cognitive Abilities than Previously Known (Common flies feature more advanced cognitive abilities than previously believed. Using a custom-built immersive virtual reality arena, neurogenetics and real-time brain activity imaging, researchers found attention, working memory and conscious awareness-like capabilities in fruit flies.)
[15:38:43] <bildramer> big if true
[15:39:00] <feep[work]> especially cause it implies the scaling for cognition starts at a really really small level
[15:39:09] <bildramer> yes, lengthens ai timelines probably
[15:39:21] <feep[work]> weh? I had the opposite take
[15:39:34] <feep[work]> it means the minimum budget to destroy the world is smaller, not larger, imo
[15:39:53] <bildramer> more of human (instead of animal) cognition is scaling to human levels rather than human specialness
[15:40:12] <feep[work]> right but doesn't that also mean you get agentic behavior sooner?
[15:40:31] <feep[work]> and cheaper
[15:40:41] <feep[work]> if fruit-flies could self-modify...
[15:40:46] <bildramer> like meta-rl already does?
[15:41:10] <feep[work]> yeah
[15:41:18] <bildramer> if fruit-flies could understand what self-modification means they wouldn't be fruit flies
[15:41:27] <feep[work]> mh      I Guess
[15:42:26] <feep[work]> means we'll get derpy evil ais I guess
[15:42:27] <bildramer> also (meming don't take me seriously) potentially via the annoying vegans -> "eeee you can't just make RL agents they're totally conscious" -> slower research pipeline
[15:45:14] <bildramer> all that said I'm not sure if it's true (flies can do some rudimentary thinking) or true (something that can be interpreted as advanced cognitive abilities exists in flies, if we interpret loosely) or just false

[23:35:25] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Google Alerts can cast a wonderful net, but mesh size matters: large holes and it catches nothing, too small and it catches everything. Consider the earliest and one of the most persistent reasons for setting these alerts: tracking yourself. All is vanity, perhaps especially on the Internet, so it’s no surprise that one of the things that we’re most eager to know is
[23:35:25] <feepbot> what the world is saying about us. The engineer who developed the alert system for Google told CNN that when he first presented the idea, twenty years ago, his manager was skeptical, worrying that it would starve the search-engine of traffic: rather than consumers constantly searching for fresh mentions of whatever topic interested them, they would wait for the alert, then follow
[23:35:25] <feepbot> its links not to Google but to outside Web sites, leaching away potential advertising revenue. In response, the engineer, one of the first forty or so employees of the company, took his prototype to Google’s co-founders, who approved it after watching him demonstrate only two search terms: “Google” and “Larry Page,” the name of one of the co-founders.'
