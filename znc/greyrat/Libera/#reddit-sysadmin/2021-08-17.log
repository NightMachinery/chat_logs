[02:45:39] <shakygator> nah PH too greasy. they thaw their dough overnight after soaking it in grease
[02:45:46] <yuken> mistiry, I wanted some shitty greasy pizza.
[02:45:47] <shakygator> can only eat 2 pieces then i want to die
[02:45:53] <mistiry> shakygator: ehhh, kinda
[02:45:58] <yuken> that I can just shovel down my pipehole.
[02:46:08] <shakygator> no they totally do
[02:46:24] <shakygator> their nightly prep is spraying the frozen pan pizzas with grease then putting them in the walk in overnight
[02:46:31] <mistiry> i worked there
[02:46:35] <mistiry> i know how they do it
[02:46:49] <shakygator> yeah i have always known people that worked their, like my brother, my wife and my pot guy
[02:46:53] <yuken> shakygator, American-style pizzas are usually incredibly greasy.
[02:46:57] <yuken> That';s their nature lol
[02:47:28] <mistiry> pan pizzas would go into the pan with some oil. youre supposed to spray "food release" spray around the outside edge of the crust
[02:47:29] <sd> 06<A​da> the best greasiest food is kebab
[02:47:42] <yuken> @Ada, souvlaki with tzatziki
[02:47:53] <mistiry> then they get a lid, and put into walkin overnight to thaw in fridge, then into the proofer in the morning for proofing
[02:47:55] <shakygator> alright so add some oil and add more grease lol
[02:48:01] <yuken> correct.
[02:48:02] <yuken> oil is good.
[02:48:32] <shakygator> idk why but ive just literally always known people that work at PH. we used to smoke blunts in one of them when i was in high school and i STILL know people that work there and this was 20 years ago
[02:48:47] <mistiry> i smoked on the PH roof
[02:48:49] <shakygator> not even just one location, at least 2
[02:48:53] <yuken> mistiry, you know, I genuinely like Pizza Hut's lemon pepper nuggets. They're very mild flavored, and mostly just getting the fatty chicken salt flavors through.
[02:49:03] <Work-BWMerlin> If you were in need of a graphics workstation which would double as an eSports PC would you get something with a "gaming" card or a "workstation" card?
[02:49:04] <mistiry> wingstreet wasnt a thing when i worked there
[02:49:07] <shakygator> their wings are on point tho
[02:49:10] <mistiry> wingstreet*
[02:49:10] <shakygator> ya the new wings
[02:49:13] <yuken> I assume I can just clone them by taking fried nuggets and addinga ton of pepper & lemon zest
[02:49:18] <shakygator> they have actual fryers now from what i understand
[02:49:25] <shakygator> not just throw them through the oven wings

[02:59:38] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> but in practice should work very nice
[02:59:56] <shakygator> the same way you do any db work, via mysqli
[03:01:43] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> yep thanks
[03:04:28] <mistiry> use the PDO stuff for PHP
[03:04:48] <cryptic1> Ur a PDO
[03:05:00] <shakygator> dont listen to mistiry use whatever you want
[03:05:23] <mistiry> ...
[03:05:27] <cryptic1> Don't listen to shakygator you aren't allowed to use whatever you want
[03:05:42] <catbeard> i really like the eloquent / query builder / collection class stuff in laravel
[03:05:50] <shakygator> im jk i only ever did mysqli cuz it was easy to s/mysql_/mysqli_
[03:05:51] <catbeard> if you're gonna use PHP, you might as well use Laravel / Lumen
[03:06:04] <catbeard> it's dbms agnostic somewhat
[03:06:17] <shakygator> yeah totally use libs when possible, dont reinvent wheels
[03:06:18] <mistiry> PHP PDO doesnt care which you use
[03:06:20] <catbeard> so you can use sqlite3 memory tables, mysql, mariadb, postgres, proxysql
[03:06:20] <mistiry> https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php
[03:06:35] <catbeard> yeah but PDO isn't Eloquent/ORM
[03:06:49] <mistiry> laravel is a web app framework 
[03:06:53] <catbeard> it is
[03:07:10] <catbeard> it can also do php based cli apps
[03:07:16] <mistiry> if he just needs to make a db connection
[03:07:18] <mistiry> seems overkill
[03:07:35] <mistiry> PDO is part of PHP already
[03:07:44] <mistiry> PDO = PHP Data Objects
[03:07:48] <catbeard> if you get a link to a root user, like, use it to create a database and create a limited user
[03:07:58] <mistiry> and if you are working with db's with PHP it is the "right" way to do it
[03:07:59] <catbeard> CREATE DATABASE db1;
[03:08:03] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> HEY
[03:08:05] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> IT WORKS
[03:08:08] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> not gonna ask how
[03:08:10] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> but it works!
[03:08:13] <shakygator> of course it works
[03:08:16] <mistiry> because it is agnostic to which db backend you are using (as long as its supported)
[03:08:18] <shakygator> ageen, why wouldnt it
[03:08:18] <catbeard> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db1.* TO 'db1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'blahpassword';
[03:08:18] <sd> 07<r​etarded discord name> that was pretty simple ngl
[03:08:22] <catbeard> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
[03:08:22] <mistiry> why wouldnt it work?
[03:08:24] <mistiry> lol
[03:08:30] <mistiry> user makes connection to db, runs query

[07:34:41] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> Cheers I'll have a look at discrete monitoring solutions. It's only one computer, and they only use it for client bookings, basically we're just monitoring to make sure staff don't go scraping the database of client details then running off with it, which we suspect one of them already partially did. They're technically subcontractors, no actual contract it's all on commission, lot of turn over in the industry, there's little to no recourse and 
[07:34:49] <misspwn> no you're just gearing up for dad jokes even if it will never be

[07:46:20] <e1> "friend" i should add
[07:46:47] <e1> every single time there was a fuckup in my order he'd blame some staff member and went so far as to say 'man i should really fire this idiot hey'
[07:47:10] <e1> but he forgot that I've been to his B&M and know it's a two person operation.. and that the person was imaginary
[07:47:50] <e1> well.. not imaginary.. just a persona for himself. Instead of blaming himself he blamed an imaginary staff member but it was like an internal sign that he fucked up, and his partner would have 100% known
[07:48:15] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> lmao
[07:48:32] <e1> small business owners are funny
[07:49:20] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> It just looks bad blaming another staff member instead of just apologising, if someone emailed me like that I would think much less of their professionalism
[07:49:46] <e1> Yeah but it makes you look incompetant constantly apologizing for your incompetance
[07:49:56] <e1> So you say "Hi sorry what was the order number? I'll check"
[07:50:29] <e1> "okay so this order was filled by travis and I'm really sorry but he's still in training and seems to have forgotten to add the x y z to the order. I will personally go dispatch this for you right now"
[07:50:45] <e1> When you're doing B2B, the B on the other end is like "Bruh fucking tell me about it how hard is it to find good help"
[07:50:57] <e1> and you look good because you personally looked after their menial order
[07:51:23] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> ohh nice lol, i forget B2B will commiserate with you lol
[07:51:56] <e1> lol yeah. Selling to consumer you just give them a discount and they stfu
[07:52:07] <e1> "Whats your account number? I'll credit you for the purchase"
[07:52:15] <e1> then they come back and spend the credit + extra + shipping anyway

[07:54:51] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> I'm amazing how happy people will be with something as small as a 5% discount, I think it's just that you're getting a discount rather than the savings

[07:56:49] <e1> lol yeah people are freaking weird
[07:56:55] <e1> idk how to structure this filesystem
[07:57:20] <e1> I have \\fs\<department>\<subdepartment> but I need to add a supervisor-specific folder in there and im like ehhhh
[07:57:37] <e1> \\fs\dept\subdept\supervisor is like... super wordy and nasty in AD
[08:03:39] <sd> 12<p​yathalon> Does AD have some sort of aliases?
[08:04:51] <e1> not sure what you mean, if you're talking about dfs or whatever. But more just my naming convention for groups hates things like that
[08:05:22] <e1> because it would be something like fs_marketing_socialmedia_supervisor_rw
[08:09:45] <xe0n> so?
[08:10:03] <xe0n> that looks fine re: naming convention
[08:10:03] <e1> it looks yucky
[08:10:32] <e1> Am I just being picky? There's no better way to restructure short of having \\fs\subdept
[08:12:42] <xe0n> why are you concerned about unc paths? use group policy to map the things and move on lol
[08:14:39] <e1> we're not a huge business. Adding complexities like this normally get forgotten about by certain people and get nuked out
[08:14:54] <e1> then they message me like 'i know youre busy doing everything but i need you to fix my mistake'
[08:15:13] <xe0n> this isn't complex stuff lol!
[08:15:49] <e1> not complex in the way of difficult, complexity as in an additional thing to remember
[08:16:15] <e1> its fine ill just make the supervisor thing fuck it
[08:16:19] <e1> like two people use it anyway
[08:17:06] <xe0n> yeah ive lost track of what you're trying to do lol
[08:18:33] <e1> honestly i dont even know at times
[08:19:23] <e1> "we want supervisors to have their own folder but we're not going to tell you who these people are or when they come and go and we dont want general staff to have access to it but we dont want supervisors logging the pos machines off to access their documents, and no we're not giving them a dedicated machine to do their administrative work from they need to do it from the pos"
[08:19:32] <e1> It's like um.. okay..
[08:21:30] <xe0n> whatta shit show
[08:21:35] <e1> yaaas
[08:23:31] <xe0n> so you create the folder they want, add an ACL
[08:23:35] <xe0n> and wait till they go errr we cant get there
[08:23:40] <xe0n> then you add em to the group
[08:23:42] <xe0n> rinse repeat
[08:23:42] <xe0n> LOL
[08:23:48] <xe0n> until eventually everyone who needs access has it
[08:23:49] <xe0n> LOL
[08:23:54] <e1> LOL
[08:24:03] <e1> We got to that final point and they reverted
[08:24:25] <e1> I went around to all supervisors and I'm like "do you use your supervisor folder?" "Oh no not at all" "So I can get rid of it?" "Oh yeah that's fine we dont use it anymore"
[08:24:27] <xe0n> i'd just leave things as they are then
[08:24:50] <xe0n> you're going to create a world of hurt not only for yourself but for the other staff as well
[08:24:51] <xe0n> lol
[08:25:05] <e1> eh they do actually need this supervisor folder
[08:25:11] <xe0n> then add it back?
[08:25:12] <xe0n> lol
[08:25:15] <e1> Yeah I am
[08:25:27] <e1> And I'm keeping it there and if they're like 'we need access' I'll be like 'you have your account'
[08:28:33] <e1> Blows my mind the number of shortcuts in \\fs\share\ that point to \\fs\share\folder

[10:53:20] <nobyk> oh cool
[10:53:45] <nobyk> is the outbound traffic working?
[10:53:55] <nobyk> can you ping 1.1.1.1 or something
[10:54:03] <n8r> yeah. I can locally ssh into the server and I can ping internet addresses
[10:54:06] <n8r> and update packages, etc.
[10:54:23] <nobyk> Did any firewall things change?
[10:54:54] <n8r> Not that I can tell. It's a Debian system with the default iptables. No ufw or other firewalls installed
[10:55:18] <nobyk> If not, then my next thing would be to install a network packet tool like tcpdump or wireshark
[10:55:52] <nobyk> wait but there is a firewall between it and the internet right?
[10:56:07] <n8r> How would one diagnose incoming traffic with wireshark?
[10:56:30] <n8r> Just the router's firewall. Only the necessary ports (80, 443, minecraft port) were forwarded
[10:56:36] <nobyk> uh you run it, but if it's a debian server I would recommend tcpdump
[10:56:38] <n8r> and ssh port
[10:56:57] <nobyk> but yeah you run it on the interface you expect things to happen on
[10:57:14] <nobyk> then try pinging, ssh, connecting to the minecraft server, whatever and see what happens and go from there
[10:57:15] <n8r> and that will ``dump'' all traffic on the interface?
[10:57:52] <nobyk> no it does the same thing as wireshark
[10:57:52] <nobyk> have you used either before?
[10:58:16] <n8r> I used wireshark ages ago on Windows

[10:59:06] *** Joins: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm)
[10:59:13] <nobyk> tcpdump is not that hard, you can just google how it works. But I've only used it in a CLI environment
[10:59:34] <n8r> sounds good
[10:59:37] <nobyk> Google what you're trying to do with it and usually the results are useful enough
[10:59:57] <nobyk> And you can do the same on your machine with some packet tool
[11:00:12] <nobyk> You can use tcpdump on the server, and wireshark on your computer. That shouldn't matter
[11:00:41] <n8r> Is it plausible that this is something that has been done by the ISP?
[11:00:53] <nobyk> And then see what's going on. You can clearly rule out for example, that if you see traffic going out on your computer, but nothing is being received on the server that traffic is leaving but is stopped somewhere on the way
[11:01:18] <nobyk> uhh maybe
[11:01:35] <n8r> but it wouldn't really explain why tor has gone down
[11:01:52] <n8r> the hidden services
[11:01:59] <nobyk> Did the servers IP change? because it's just on the LAN of that router then right? Not actually on the internet
[11:02:19] <n8r> We did have a moment where its local ip address changed
[11:02:26] <n8r> but it was fixed quickly
[11:02:45] <nobyk> how did it change? No IP conflict I hope

[19:32:58] <PublicWifi> my neighbors always had cats n shit when I was in an apartment
[19:35:37] <voice06[m]> I still find it amusing they want $70 for the privilege of attaching an antenna/dish to the balcony
[19:35:37] <fritzwastaken> i mean, we have cats

[19:36:06] <oxipital> our dogs would bark at something
[19:36:06] <oxipital> their baby would start crying
[19:36:06] <oxipital> repeat
[19:36:06] <oxipital> somehow our fault
[19:36:11] <fritzwastaken> the maintenence guy narqed on us
[19:37:11] <MikeSpears> yea I'm so glad I started renting a house
[19:37:28] <MikeSpears> landlord doesn't give a shit as long as things are maintained
[19:37:51] <oxipital> what sucks is the landlord sided with the baby owners over the dog owners
[19:38:12] <derpadmin> baby > dog
[19:38:31] <MikeSpears> oxipital that's kinda the law :|
[19:38:42] <derpadmin> but then again, who cares if a baby cries?
[19:38:47] <MikeSpears> babies are protected, dogs aren't

[19:39:11] <oxipital> what, that people who pay a pet deposit and $75 extra a month should make special concessions over someones brat?
[19:39:35] <oxipital> versus: "no one can be responsible for how your child sleeps"
[19:39:59] <voice06[m]> the contract here states if your pet becomes a nuisance to other residents its your problem and if you can get your pet under control you have to get rid of it or move out
[19:40:33] <oxipital> i don't have an issue with that if nuisance is reasonably understood
[19:41:08] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i consider children to be a nuisance

[19:43:12] <oxipital> and are bad at family planning
[19:43:13] <voice06[m]> the biggest pet issues around here are owners who don't clean up after their dog takes a shit
[19:43:15] <DOMF> it's a capitalism issue, not a supply issue

[23:24:49] <oxipital> only thing more annoying than all caps is people who add caps for emphasis in normal writing
[23:24:55] <oxipital> or italics
[23:25:27] <MISTIRY> what is your preferred method of emphasis?
[23:25:30] <sd> 05<J​acobC> I do that
[23:25:40] <sd> 05<J​acobC> but only when somebody is clearly not reading my emails
[23:25:47] <oxipital> emphasis should be carried in context
[23:25:59] <MISTIRY> i mean, italics is the proper way afaik
[23:26:08] <fritzwastaken> Caps, Bold, and red text
[23:26:18] <fritzwastaken> Word art

[23:26:45] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> and I say "professional" just because they're getting paid to write them
[23:27:14] <iphone> what is wrong with bold?
[23:27:19] <oxipital> and i mean normal text
[23:27:25] <iphone> bold is *fine* when used right
[23:27:31] <MISTIRY> yeah ive seen bold, i prefer bold when you're pointing something important out, usually more than one word. whereas italics is for applying emphasis to usually a single word, to emulate speaking
[23:27:36] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> no I mean like copious use of bold
[23:27:37] <oxipital> this is twitter - not a novel or something 
[23:27:58] <iphone> do real people use twitter?
[23:28:06] <iphone> like actual humans?
[23:28:18] <MISTIRY> ...yes?
[23:28:19] <iphone> like, people that have hotboxed a bison on vacation in Montana
[23:28:43] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> as usual there is a TVTropes that covers that

[23:29:32] <iphone> or like this goat.se
[23:30:45] <iphone> I ask what it is, because it was mentioned in a way as if to insinuate that I should have known about it. Like it was Google, or FaceBook
[23:31:05] <oxipital> that link with the bold is oddly satisfying
[23:31:23] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> So you know what a trope is right?
[23:31:40] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> It basically a catalog of all the tropes that occur in media
