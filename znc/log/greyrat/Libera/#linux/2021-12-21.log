[06:33:34] <lockywolf> Guest21932, battery, or powerbank?
[06:33:58] <lockywolf> I had that problem with a non-default battery
[06:34:04] <lockywolf> Firmware was freaking out on unofficial batteries.
[06:34:22] <tangledwire> is this really a ryzen 3 machine?
[06:34:28] <Guest21932> yes
[06:34:44] <Guest21932> it is really fast if i plug it in

[06:36:04] <Guest21932> it definitly does not temparily boost clock speed

[06:36:20] <Guest21932> opening firefox takes 30-40 seconds
[06:36:30] <Guest21932> maybe a second or two when plugged in
[06:36:35] <Dagmar> I blame the distro
[06:36:53] <lockywolf> Dagmar, that is easy to check, by just booting from a livecd
[06:36:58] <lockywolf> and running perf
[06:37:10] <lockywolf> sorry, running stress
[06:37:15] <tangledwire> can you use cpufreq to check the cpu clock speed when it's under load?
[06:37:44] <Guest21932> its slow before any power manage would be running, like just turning it off and then pressing power button takes ages to boot into linux

[06:41:11] <Dagmar> lockywolf: One of the reasons people tolerate the slowness of relational databases is that they're _meant_ to have multiple things accessing them at once
[06:41:20] <panella32> Dagmar sudo hdparm --security-disable xxxx /dev/sd?
[06:41:20] <panella32> But I don't remember the password. What should I replace with 'xxxx'?

[06:41:50] <lockywolf> Dagmar, I thought that the main reason for database existence is to wrok with databases that do not fit  into memory.
[06:41:53] <lockywolf> *work
[06:42:02] <Dagmar> lockywolf: nope.  It's all about the ACID.
[06:42:16] <DaleGribble[m]> lol
[06:42:18] <Dagmar> lockwolf: The performance hit even for things that won't conveniently fit into RAM is pretty hefty
[06:42:55] <Dagmar> lockywolf: Let me give you a real world example...  I've got reoughly 32,000 cryptocurrency transactions spanning the last four years in a CSV.
[06:42:55] <DaleGribble[m]> there are all kinds of different use cases for different types of databases, some ONLY work and live in RAM, some only on disk, some use both etc.

[06:44:32] <DaleGribble[m]> > ten minutes <- something is very wrong then
[06:44:42] <Dagmar> It does until you realize that it's doing a double-write and ensuring the data is really-and-for-true written to disk after each and every transaction

[06:45:03] <lockywolf> and it's only 11:00
[06:45:06] <Dagmar> There's basically a latency cost for writes like that
[06:45:06] <panella32> Dagmar what if I try more guesses to find the password? I mean, in this status, is there a possibility that the disk even doesn't accept the correct password?
[06:45:33] <Dagmar> panella32: That depends on how many times you want to powercycle the thing, because each time you hit the limit of what it'll tolerate it'll need to be powercycled.
[06:45:56] <Dagmar> panella32: Basically, unless you can magically guess the password you set, you are never seeing that data again.
[06:46:08] <Dagmar> Depending on what the manufacturer had in mind the drive may refuse to ever work again

[06:47:47] <Dagmar> DB reads, when things are not locked, happen pretty reasonably quick, and a good relational DB with data that is actually inter-related, happen quite briskly
[06:47:54] <DaleGribble[m]> agreed lockywolf
[06:48:05] <panella32> Dagmar Honestly at this point I'm quite okay with losing the data. Because I have almost %90 of the data somewhere else. So I'd be quite happy if I can format the disk and at least reuse it. It's not feasible?
[06:48:16] <lockywolf> Anyway, my use-case is the following. I am running Prosody jabber server, and I want to have two prosody servers with a single backend.
[06:48:21] <Dagmar> It's a single-threaded operation on a Phenom II.  Don't expect massive performance.

[06:49:46] <panella32> Dagmar okay thank you. I'll check it out.
[06:50:02] <Dagmar> If they're mainly jsut reading and not writing simultaneously there shouldn't really be much of an issue
[06:50:03] <lockywolf> Maybe not entirely stateless, because I would have to get tls certificates and such, but at least stateless for important data

[06:50:51] <Dagmar> LOTS of docs online on how to spin up your own certificate authority
[06:51:08] <Dagmar> You can too send your CA cert to a user
[06:51:09] <lockywolf> That is planned eventually, but I want to federate.
[06:51:21] <Dagmar> Obviously don't send them the freakin private key for it
[06:51:24] <lockywolf> Android doesn't allow that easily
[06:51:40] <Dagmar> Ohh... Yeah there's a minimum password requirement on most of the devices before they'll let you
[06:51:58] <Dagmar> THey'll need at minimum a PIN unlock applied usually

[09:09:59] <SudoBash> why are you nazi's? you tell people to run all commands given to them, then you lay into someone hard for saying "Don't just run everything everyone say" and then jump their case about how they calm down.....
[09:10:01] <firepup> Guest21932 irc works like that. you can enable logging which should be a typical option
[09:10:05] <spyroboy> I mean it's pretty obvious he doesn't run a real client. his name is Guest.
[09:10:13] <EdFletcher> Haha indeed
[09:10:18] <Guest21932> irc doesn't not inherently work like that no? you have to store logs yourself.
[09:10:21] <lockywolf> or, rather I do not recommend running  ZNC , but I would recommend running _some_ IRC proxy
[09:10:38] <Psi-Jack> ZNC is great. Been using it for years.
[09:10:45] <lockywolf> Guest21932, if you have a proxy running on you server, it would natually collect all the logs

[10:20:27] <jim> he knew
[10:20:37] <tusko> i dont think he knew
[10:20:39] <lockywolf> he knew
[10:20:40] <neshpion> i got the impression that it's a libera culture thing to not wear the @.  besides, when an oper +o's up, it's a power move
[10:20:45] <neshpion> gotta hide the @ for the power move
[10:20:57] <lockywolf> but he is not the only one

[10:21:01] <Sauvin> There's pros and cons to wearing the @ all the time. I don't ban often (this channel is *usually* remarkably well behaved), and I really do like interacting with people as just another Joe.

[10:22:05] <neshpion> no
[10:22:06] <Psi-Jack> lilo was a good man.
[10:22:25] <mlu> there was an image thing: back in those days, people with @s typically abused their power: there were a few well-moderated channels around, but they were a small minority

[10:24:46] <neshpion> lockywolf: on the contrary, i think wearing it to constantly be in the mindset of not being equal is the bigger deception, and the more dangerous one

[16:29:40] <Ensir> It feels pointless to have a lock screen if you can just change tty to get access to a computer that's supposed to be locked.
[16:29:59] <rascul> it locks your desktop session, not the computer
[16:30:30] <Ensir> To stop a malicious user from getting access, how should I disable tty switching?
[16:30:46] <rascul> disable the other ttys

[16:31:55] <Ensir> When you put it that way, it would require knowing the user password to gain access.

[19:21:20] <tirnanog> it is confusing, though.
[19:21:36] <Psi-Jack> Note that on many SysV systems halt used to be synonymous to poweroff, i.e. both commands would equally result in powering the machine off. systemd is more accurate here, and halt results in halting the machine only (leaving power on), and poweroff is required to actually power it off.
[19:21:39] <rendar> so i should always use poweroff?
[19:21:51] <Psi-Jack> rendar: If you want to poweroff, yes.
[19:21:54] <rendar> ok
[19:21:55] <tirnanog> basically, yeah. poweroff is the portable method, as it were.
[19:22:02] <tirnanog> at least, portable enough for gnu/linux.

[19:24:59] <hexnewbie> There's one positive side-effect of the halt change: If you liked the pre-ATX behaviour, you can put a hard switch on the front-side of you box, set your computer to Always On, then use halt and flip the power switch (cause 'poweroff' would then be a reboot). Unfortunately, DEs wouldn't provide that menu option

[20:03:03] <kfrench> skintimidation: Shoving the entire screen is a single action.  X has a ton of back and forth conversations.  Latency is a huge problem for X.  It's a problem for VNC, but not nearly as much.
[20:03:15] <skintimidation> Interesting.
[20:03:21] <tirnanog> VNC isn't quite that primitive and X11 forwarding can, in fact, be quite expensive. still, it's clearly not a remark born of a nuanced perspective. I've tended to use X11 forwarding where I've needed the I/O to be local to the application in question and where graphical performance isn't the foremost concern.

[20:09:08] <tirnanog> likely. RDP is pretty clever, as I understand it.
[20:09:20] <ioria> skintimidation,  X does not  send the screen to your pc;  it sends the 'instructions' on your local pc to re-draw the screen , add the network load
[20:09:22] <tirnanog> especially windows to windows.
[20:09:43] <hodapp> yeah, X11 by itself is quite chatty, and it's part of why NX was invented

[23:40:15] <HimeHaieto> hasn't seen a change, but that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't modified before being saved away
[23:40:36] <HimeHaieto> though I've really only seen/heard of that sort of thing for modifying line endings before committing/checking out
[23:40:50] <HimeHaieto> it's really weird
[23:41:28] <mrfb> when did the same process stop to work?
[23:42:04] <Eryn83FL_Matrix[> ok that was a mess
[23:42:24] <Eryn83FL_Matrix[> got gnome to start kodi, auto login, had to enable the shares so it could read the shows,

[23:44:42] <mrfb> because it doesn't make any sense if the patches didnt change, then why does not work ?
[23:45:18] <HimeHaieto> mrfb: afaik I think I 1) made the patch with diff, 2) was able to apply it with patch, 3) stored it away in the repo, 4) ?, 5) pulled the patch back out and failed to apply it

[23:46:46] <HimeHaieto> best I can figure, weird scripts in the repo have to have done things I can't fathom reasons for
[23:46:52] <rustytaco> i love when we build stuff then some tard is like "zomg we need it containerized" and we're like "Nope. we run on OUR dedicated hardware, not some virtual nonsense"

[23:47:18] <mrfb> if the change was while the patches were on the git repo the good news is that it's there

[23:48:29] <HimeHaieto> problem is that what I'm wanting is to apply and work on someone else's patch now
[23:48:40] <HimeHaieto> so I don't get that same benefit
[23:49:11] <HimeHaieto> I'm going to prolly have to probe through build scripts or something to see if someone is doing something nasty
[23:49:42] <HimeHaieto> because literally like every single patch in the git history is like that

[23:51:43] <HimeHaieto> perhaps, but the earliest log I seem to have atm is with the underscore
[23:52:09] <tirnanog> HimeHaieto: 1) replace all ranges with "@@ -1 +1 @@" 2) run the patch through recountdiff from diffutils 3) hope for the best
[23:52:09] <HimeHaieto> that's why I'm thinking some script kiddie thought it'd be a good idea to do something weird to transform the files
[23:52:16] <Psi-Jack> Real question is, Why are you... Storing patches, in git?

[23:53:27] <Psi-Jack> I was thinking that the moment he said he had patches... In git....
[23:53:30] <mrfb> I think as some kind of backup system
[23:53:36] <HimeHaieto> it's because they're patches for releases from a separate project
[23:53:44] <Psi-Jack> git != backup system
[23:54:10] <HimeHaieto> that doesn't have the full repo available, etc, like an "unofficial patches" kind of thing

[23:54:43] <Psi-Jack> Normally you would still not store JUST patches.
[23:55:03] <Psi-Jack> because patches too are version dependent as well.
[23:55:05] <mrfb> since you mention something about recovering from the backup, then mention git, so I united the knots

[23:55:24] <Psi-Jack> If you try to apply patches to newer or different versions of the codebase they were intended, they will likely fail.
[23:55:26] <HimeHaieto> psi-jack: group a releases java application b, with point releases x.y, etc
[23:55:40] <Psi-Jack> And?
[23:55:41] <HimeHaieto> group b writes patches that get applied to it
[23:55:43] <Psi-Jack> Still nonsense.
