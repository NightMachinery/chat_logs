[15:05:02] <s-liao> wasamasa last time, we talked about that supporting forward-sexp in REPL , But as you said that it impossible to have parse-partial-sexp like in Emacs. Because it need buffer and syntax tables. But What I found out is that Edwin sound like support it.
[15:05:50] <wasamasa> I didn't say it's impossible, just that it's not the easy route
[15:06:01] <wasamasa> you're going to pull in a lot more from emacs than you want to
[15:06:49] <s-liao> But I only saw it on mit-scheme implementation.

[15:07:26] <wasamasa> PoC||GTFO
[15:07:47] <wasamasa> if you cannot communicate your ideas clearly in human language, maybe you can better in code
[15:08:12] <wasamasa> show me
[15:09:23] <s-liao> it is too different for me. I have not know reader of Emacs yet.
[15:09:50] <wasamasa> it doesn't have anything to do with the reader, lol
[15:10:02] <wasamasa> it's all about syntax.c
[15:10:15] <wasamasa> the sexp movement commands don't know how to actually parse lisp
[15:10:47] <wasamasa> the reason edwin might support this is because it ships with its own emacs, lol
[15:11:09] <s-liao> Yes. This one is not about reader. I mean that it would be better know reader firstly, then work on this topic.
[15:11:17] <wasamasa> so if your goal was to solve this the easy way by just borrowing whatever someone else has solved, congrats, you might have solved this at the cost of pulling in an entire editor, lol
[15:11:17] <s-liao> I hope it make sense.
[15:12:02] <wasamasa> sort of, but your approach seems weird
[15:12:12] <wasamasa> you pull up funny examples and ask why they behave the way they do

[17:48:11] <s-liao> parse-partial-sexp, like what it the parser does with the sexp, the min unit is syntax table and the level of the sexp as well. What Reader the parser does , read character by character, make the min unit like vector,list,symbols, hash-table, char-table of Elisp language.
[17:50:29] <s-liao> edwin is a scheme implementation, which is different than parse-partial-sexp ,which is C implementation.

For instance I'm interested in embedding chicken into an environment where the io module doesn't make sense. It wouldn't be hard for me to fork the repository and remove instance of the io module, but I'm curious if there's a more practical way to customize the build.

[22:02:17] <Bunny351> aconbere: I think the easiest way is to fork. Trying a general approach is likely to complicate the normal build for very little gain for the user
[22:04:17] <aconbere> Bunny351: sounds good, thanks for the adviuce
[22:05:31] <aconbere> uhhhh advice
[22:13:25] <aconbere> heh `; "This is insane. What we clearly want to do is not exactly clear, and is rooted in NCOMPLR." `
[22:20:26] <aconbere> Bunny351: guess follow up question: is this a stupid idea? hahaha
[22:21:01] <aconbere> I'm thinking of chicken in this case as a bit analagous to lua in it's ability for me to embed it
[22:22:24] <mario-goulart`> aconbere: I wonder if it would help to leave the build system alone and just remove $PREFIX/lib/chicken/11/chicken.io.import.so after installation, so that it cannot be imported; and set all chicken.io#<symbol> to something like #f.
[22:24:15] <aconbere> mario-goulart`: yeah I see, since the imports are just loading object files, we can still build them and just remove the files after the fact
[22:24:18] <aconbere> that's a neat idea
[22:24:25] <mario-goulart`> You can programatically get all symbols exported by chicken.io by parsing chicken.io.import.scm from the sources.
[22:25:53] <mario-goulart`> Note that even if you don't import chicken.io you can still access it without importing it via, for example, chicken.io#read-line (that's why I mentioned setting all chicken.io symbols to #f).
[22:29:25] <mario-goulart`> I have a feeling forking the build system and tweaking it to remove some modules will be quite laborious.
[22:30:49] <mario-goulart`> Probably a good learning experience though (if not frustrating, in case you have to deliver something within some deadline).
