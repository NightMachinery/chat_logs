[07:42:49] <NeoVoid[m]> can anyone tell how can i fix this?
[07:43:50] <NeoVoid[m]> or do i need to remove virtual box to have virt-man installed
[08:16:53] <AryaBackup[m]> weird
[08:16:55] <AryaBackup[m]> remove virtualbox
[08:16:57] <AryaBackup[m]> and virt-manager
[08:17:01] <AryaBackup[m]> and reinstall both
[08:17:08] <AryaBackup[m]> i had a similar issue with jack2 
[08:17:19] <AryaBackup[m]> i had to remove pipewire-jack and pipewire-support
[08:17:20] <AryaBackup[m]> update
[08:17:29] <AryaBackup[m]> and reinstall jack2 and the pw pkgs

[09:06:05] <AryaBackup[m]> tommorow is holiday 
[09:06:29] <pystardust> Yeeee, holiday! Im excited too
[09:06:59] <pystardust> testuser[m]: who u?
[09:07:26] <pystardust> Our buddy gtls had a great marriage
[09:08:01] <ramram[m]> pystardust: what you talking about
[09:08:21] <AryaBackup[m]> nice pystardust 
[09:08:43] <pystardust> ramram[m]: u didnt know? gtls got married 3 days ago
[09:09:02] <ramram[m]> pystardust: noo
[09:10:46] <pystardust> Btw, i wanted to ask, some open source projects use discord for discussion. What do u guys think about it?
[09:11:31] <pystardust> Both ani-cli and ytfzf. And due to the easy of use i can see visible faster development when they use it
[09:15:08] <testuser[m]> I don't think it's ease of use
[09:15:13] <testuser[m]> Its cuz everyone is already on shitcord
[09:15:26] <testuser[m]> And everyone is waiting for everyone else to switch first before switching to matrix or something thrmselves
[09:16:57] <pystardust> Well the same issue again the samw thing as telegram
[09:18:01] <pystardust> I don't think matrix is polished enough for them to make the jump
[09:18:31] <AryaBackup[m]> like what
[09:18:44] <AryaBackup[m]> is not good in matrix
[09:18:46] <AryaBackup[m]> btw pystardust you can ask them to use irc right
[09:18:48] <AryaBackup[m]> you are the lead dev
[09:18:51] <testuser[m]> Bruh irc
[09:18:56] <testuser[m]> No one's gonna use it
[09:18:57] <AryaBackup[m]> or matrix
[09:18:59] <AryaBackup[m]> its bridged üôÇ
[09:19:29] <testuser[m]> Element ui isn't that bad apart from some confusing stuff like encryption keys, should be fine for anyone with a dev background
[09:19:34] <AryaBackup[m]> yeah
[09:19:41] <AryaBackup[m]> element is normie friendly
[09:19:46] <AryaBackup[m]> just the names 
[09:19:56] <AryaBackup[m]> spaces (servers) rooms (channels) 
[09:20:30] <pystardust> AryaBackup[m]: im not exactly very active, i wrote the initial code but they do tinkers on top of it which im not a active participant off. I dont even stay in those discord groups. I let it be cause noobs can easily go ask other ppl questions
[09:20:51] <AryaBackup[m]> bridge?
[09:21:17] <AryaBackup[m]> you can request them to bridge right
[09:21:54] <AryaBackup[m]> i have a selfhosted ttrss now
[09:21:55] <AryaBackup[m]> so i can sync rss between phone and pc
[09:22:25] <pystardust> True, bridge for irc wont work very well with so many channels
