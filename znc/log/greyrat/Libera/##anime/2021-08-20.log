[03:05:30] <Nanobot> Worst-case scenario that I'm willing to entertain: If I go ahead and quit right now, and Bitcoin doesn't reach my selling price range this year, I have enough money in the bank to pay this year's taxes, plus 1.5 years' post-tax salary (which is probably 50% more than I actually spend in 1.5 years), plus all my bitcoins. If I were to sell them next year at my target price range, even with Biden's tax increases, I'll be better off than selling them this 
[03:05:31] <Nanobot> year without Biden's tax increases.

[03:17:45] <Nanobot> The reason I'll be making more money if I sell at my target next year rather than this year is because I've already realized gains this year, to the point where any additional gains I make this year will pretty much be taxed at the top rates.

[06:42:03] <emmeka> there were a whole bunch of cars at our usually derelict community hall in my 125 population township, so I assumed there must've been a town hall meeting that I just missed the notice for. I showed up, and it was actually a vaccine clinic, for first doses.
[06:42:24] <emmeka> but I showed up when they were going to close in 15 minutes and they had a Pfizer already open, so they just gave me my second dose
[06:42:54] <isekaijin> emmeka: Nice. Congrats.
[06:43:35] <emmeka> my actual appointment for second dose wasn't until October because the government has decided to entirely prioritize first doses, and considers my area and age group to be unimportant, I guess.

[08:44:49] <name100> hi amigojapan 
[08:44:56] <name100> PAL
[08:45:18] <amigojapan> Hi name100 
[08:46:11] <Cryowolf> that new game "12 minutes" is out on gamepass
[08:46:35] <Cryowolf> it's about reliving a temporal loop of 12 minutes and making it out alive
[08:50:52] <emmeka> Cryowolf Stardew Valley "sort of" has full controller support.
[08:50:59] <emmeka> you can't select diagonally with controllers.
[08:51:23] <Cryowolf> with the analogue arrows you can select any direction
[08:51:40] <emmeka> this usually isn't a problem, but it prevents you from placing things in such a way that you could only access them diagonally. which, for example, means you can't fill the basement with the maximum number of casks.
[08:52:18] <Cryowolf> and either I play this or I just keep staring at a list of games for hours, then go to bed and sleep
[08:52:38] <amigojapan> Hi emmeka. I am watching re zero with tomako now. You suggested it a while ago

[08:54:38] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, the main character of Re: Zero...
[08:55:07] <amigojapan> Right Subaru Cryowolf 
[08:55:32] <emmeka> Subaru isn't your typical isekai MC. He goes into it with the assumption that he will be, though.
[08:55:33] <Cryowolf> he's very annoying in the first few story ars
[08:55:34] <Cryowolf> arcs
[08:55:40] <emmeka> he's annoying in a good way
[08:55:40] <MootPoot> emmeka: the correct game to play is graveyard keeper 
[08:56:08] <Cryowolf> There's lots of Isekai's now that go against the stereotype grain
[08:56:14] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: well I was looking for an isekai without overpowered MC
[08:56:17] <emmeka> none that do it like re zero does.
[08:56:38] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, well then you found the right one

[08:56:41] <MootPoot> Its time for the against isekai trope trope
[08:56:58] <MootPoot> amigojapan: something something grimgar
[08:57:15] <amigojapan> Hi MootPoot 
[08:57:26] <emmeka> Grimgar is good, but the characters aren't really underpowered.
[08:57:29] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, another one running atm is "Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki". The MC isn't overpowered and the focus is more on his intelligence
[08:57:37] <Cryowolf> Grimgar bored me
[08:57:39] <emmeka> it's just sort of... isekai hyperrealism
[08:57:45] <MootPoot> amigojapan: Hai
[08:58:09] <emmeka> Cryowolf I hate smart MCs, honestly.
[08:58:11] <Cryowolf> I don't want hyperrealism in an Isekai. To me Isekai signal "escape"
[08:58:23] <amigojapan> Ok Cryowolf I will check it out
[08:58:29] <emmeka> Subaru's an idiot, and this is precisely what makes him great. He's not smart or skilled or even a particularly good person.
[08:58:44] <amigojapan> !a genjitsuahugi
[08:58:45] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: I don't recognize that anime.
[08:58:52] <emmeka> he makes a lot of bad decisions, and those have consequences.
[08:59:08] <Cryowolf> emmeka, he's not the type of smart Zero is, he's the type of smart that grasps thes ituations at hand
[08:59:11] <amigojapan> !a genjitsu shugi
[08:59:11] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki (TV Series, 13 episodes) | Next episode: #8 (ETA: 1 day, 13 hours) | http://anidb.net/a15505 | http://myanimelist.net/anime/41710
[08:59:23] <Cryowolf> recognises his own weaknesses and finds people to fill in for them
[08:59:28] <Cryowolf> and so on
[08:59:42] <Cryowolf> kind of like a real leader would
[08:59:49] <emmeka> yeah, pass. tactician isekai is overdone.
[09:00:05] <Cryowolf> I have yet to see him be a tactician
[09:00:21] <emmeka> I just wanna see more of Subaru bleeding over the 5D chess board that is the plot of re:zero
[09:00:36] <Cryowolf> you seem to be drawing out assumption after assumption after your former assumption missed :P
[09:01:01] <emmeka> both assumptions are related.
[09:01:10] <Cryowolf> the MC def isnt an idiot like Subaru tho, nor is he annoying like Subaru
[09:01:41] <Cryowolf> but Subaru at least learns and grows in some areas
[09:02:23] <Cryowolf> Konosuba is one of the best isekais though
[09:03:43] <Cryowolf> and I always prefer if you're gonna have an isekai where you show a very overpowered MC. Make sure that's just in the beginning before the powerful people of that world begin totake notice and are actually a threat to the MC,so they might be OP to the general population. But in that "category", he/she is just one of many
[09:05:05] <emmeka> then you just hit the power scaling problem quicker
[09:05:08] <emmeka> so meh
[09:05:25] <Cryowolf> how so?
[09:08:44] <emmeka> Cryowolf the fatal flaw of all action anime, as the series go on, the characters must get stronger. As they get stronger, the villains must get stronger. This goes on endlessly until you hit a point where everyone is so powerful that battles are boring because everyone has this massive repertoire of super elite skills and stats
[09:09:18] <emmeka> if you start the series off by immediately bypassing most of the power scaling in a massive skip, you effectively cut out anything potentially interesting
[09:10:10] <Cryowolf> that depends what the focus of your story is on. Is it on the power scales, battles and different special abilities? Or is that just something that happenso n the side of things
[09:10:30] <emmeka> doesn't really matter.
[09:10:32] <amigojapan> emmeka: I think the flaw Is More in how it is too predictable
[09:10:35] <Cryowolf> yes it does
[09:10:51] <emmeka> unless the story isn't focused on battles at all, which I why I specified it as "all action anime"
[09:11:19] <Cryowolf> lots of anime contains the action genre
[09:11:32] <Cryowolf> but still isnt focused on battles as much
[09:12:08] <emmeka> look I'm not gonna try and argue with you about whether the power scaling problem in anime exists or is a thing, because you can just google that and I'm sure people with much more weeb skills than me can tell you all about it.
[09:12:11] <Cryowolf> anyway Im gonna go lie down for awhile
[09:12:47] <Cryowolf> it exists, but it doesn't always play a role of importance
[09:12:52] <amigojapan> Take care Cryowolf 
[09:12:53] <Cryowolf> and is sometimes the point
[09:13:28] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:13:50] <Cryowolf> like Overlord. The whole point is that Ainz isthat powerful, since we're following the devolution of a person becoming his character, a villain. Someone that wants to conquer the world and no longer cares about humans, no longer has any empathy
[09:14:04] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[09:14:05] <Cryowolf> and now he and his minions are that powerful
[09:14:16] <amigojapan> emmeka: I just watched rayearth which terribly suffers from the power scaling problem
[09:14:30] <Cryowolf> so you're basically in a story where the guy you rooted for, is now the main villain
[09:14:34] <emmeka> I'm just gonna say that bypassing all of that doesn't make for anything particularly eventful. Perfect example of this is Slime, Rimuru is instantly OP and for a while goes around owning everything until he actually manages to attract the attention of the world's strongest. Then the real fights should happen, right?
[09:14:42] <emmeka> except instead it's bland.
[09:14:46] <emmeka> it's the same shit as before.
[09:15:09] <Cryowolf> so what youre saying is...we have different tastes?
[09:15:11] <MootPoot> He's a slime, what did you expect it to taste like 
[09:15:21] <MootPoot> Slime gonna slime 
[09:15:26] <Cryowolf> we like differentt hings
[09:15:27] <emmeka> no, I think the overpowered MC character has a definite point in existing
[09:15:35] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I'm installing a new cpu cooler 
[09:15:36] <Nanobot> The Dixie wildfire is now at 700k acres. 35% contained. It's currently the second largest wildfire in California history (the largest was in 2020), and is the largest single-source wildfire in California history (the next largest was 380k acres)
[09:15:39] <MootPoot> Old one is about to die 
[09:16:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: ok good luck
[09:16:14] <Cryowolf> so youre gonna argue that this is entirely objective and not subjective and that personal likes or dislikes dont matter? Come on
[09:16:50] <Cryowolf> I don't think it's an issue in most of the ones I watch, but then I turn off the critic in my head and just enjoy it
[09:16:54] <MootPoot> Cum on
[09:17:28] <emmeka> Cryowolf I think your assertion of what would make for a "better" plot with an overpowered MC is a misapplication of the trope and doesn't make for something very watcheable.

[09:30:40] <theholyduck> i dont think emmeka is saying overpowered mc is ALWAYS a bad thing
[09:30:45] <emmeka> I didn't say overpowered MCs were a bad thing. You should reread what I wrote.
[09:30:45] <theholyduck> theres just a point where it comes sad
[09:31:11] <theholyduck> and then you keep going and theres a point where it becomes hillariously stupid

[09:39:39] <name100> snus is basically risk free
[09:39:40] <DunceCotus> name100: the safe alternative is vaping
[09:39:46] <name100> but ok
[09:39:55] <name100> if u r so stubborn but u need to live here to accept that....
[09:40:07] <theholyduck> i mean i live in norway
[09:40:08] <DunceCotus> snus could grant mouth or jaw issues
[09:40:08] <emmeka> DunceCotus I'll take the plant matter over the mystery manufactured juice.
[09:40:10] <theholyduck> people snus here all the time
[09:40:17] <name100> ok.....
[09:40:24] <DunceCotus> emmeka: eh both are mystery manufactured
[09:40:33] <emmeka> not mine, but it's k.
[09:40:34] <DunceCotus> since tobacco is rarely just plant material
[09:40:42] <DunceCotus> emmeka: ok
[09:40:55] * emmeka buys his tobacco from the reserve
[09:41:05] <DunceCotus> sure if you know the grower
[09:41:07] <DunceCotus> that's a bit diff
[09:41:11] <emmeka> but also, I'm growing my own this year, which is fun
[09:41:31] <emmeka> I got a couple nice ones that made it past the flea beatles
[09:41:39] <emmeka> coming up on bloom now
[09:42:09] <DunceCotus> emmeka: sounds highly illegal
[09:42:12] <theholyduck> i mean i agree snus is probably safer than smoking
[09:42:16] <theholyduck> name100: theres data its harmful 
[09:42:19] <theholyduck> but less so than for smoking
[09:42:36] <theholyduck> but being a SAFER alternative doesnt make it risk free or no effects

[09:42:54] <DunceCotus> without license or whatnot
[09:42:54] <emmeka> it's perfectly legal.
[09:43:00] <theholyduck> hes talking abut funny tobacco though im pretty sure
[09:43:02] <emmeka> you of course need a license to *sell* it.
[09:43:07] <theholyduck> which is legal in canada now i think

[09:44:38] <name100> that's why they don't have some snus in norway theholyduck ?
[09:44:45] <DunceCotus> to buy vape liquid you need prescription
[09:44:50] <theholyduck> name100: no idea for any specific ones 
[09:44:56] <theholyduck> norway requires plain packaging on snus
[09:44:57] <DunceCotus> and there are some dodgy docs opening up to provide just that
[09:44:58] <theholyduck> atleast
[09:44:58] <DunceCotus> ;)
[09:45:20] <theholyduck> i mean vaping liquid will become legal next year i think
[09:45:27] <theholyduck> if memory serves of recent changes to the law
[09:45:40] <theholyduck> like they recently legalized caffeine pills and melatonin pills
[09:45:42] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: so vaping itself is currently illegal there?
[09:45:46] <DunceCotus> or just purchase?
[09:45:49] <theholyduck> DunceCotus:  selling or distributing
[09:45:51] <emmeka> DunceCotus gotta realize tobacco is a plant with religious and cultural significance in this country. Banning its cultivation for personal use... that'd be problematic.
[09:46:01] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: you are allowed to import for personal use
[09:46:05] <theholyduck> up to like x months 
[09:46:07] <theholyduck> of usage
[09:46:09] <theholyduck> i think its 3?
[09:46:13] <theholyduck> i forget the law. i dont vape
[09:46:16] <DunceCotus> emmeka: sure
[09:46:53] <theholyduck> but yeah seeing as we only legalized caffeine pills like
[09:46:54] <theholyduck> last year
[09:46:56] <theholyduck> or something
[09:47:07] <theholyduck> and ecigs next year
[09:47:11] <DunceCotus> caffeine pills are bad news
[09:47:14] <theholyduck> somehow i doubt we will do much on weed
[09:47:23] <theholyduck> DunceCotus:  meh. its a cost saving measure for me
[09:47:35] <theholyduck> a energy drink is like 3 bucks 
[09:47:43] <theholyduck> even coffee is pretty pricy really 
[09:47:44] <DunceCotus> hmm sure
[09:47:56] <DunceCotus> what about dexamphetamine
[09:48:12] <theholyduck> meanwhile i can buy a bottle of a few hundred caffeinepills for like 10 bucks
[09:48:16] <theholyduck> and it will last me months
[09:48:35] <theholyduck> that sounds like something that would be illegal
[09:48:50] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: its similar to adderall
[09:49:00] <theholyduck> i mean i imagine you CAN get it on prescription
[09:49:07] <theholyduck> but i never even known anyone who is on aderall 
[09:49:21] <theholyduck> norway is real strict about anything even remotely narcotic
[09:49:30] <theholyduck> like ive gotten opiod based painkillers like once
[09:49:40] <emmeka> sounds normal.
[09:49:53] <DunceCotus> yeah few places are relaxed on narcotics
[09:49:53] <theholyduck> emmeka: you say that but like seemingly everyone in america gets just oxy 
[09:50:05] <theholyduck> or have aderall prescriptions
[09:50:12] <DunceCotus> oxy is bad news bears
[09:50:31] <emmeka> oxy was hard to get off, for me.
[09:50:37] <theholyduck> emmeka:  like senti was on oxy after dental surgery the other day
[09:50:49] <emmeka> I didn't expect it to be, withdrawal was actually hard on me though.
[09:50:54] <DunceCotus> dex is not exactly adderall, adderall has amphetamine salts as well
[09:50:59] <Cryowolf> If you want an isekai that's very very very different. Try Sonny Boy
[09:51:08] <theholyduck> im not saying they are the same
[09:51:08] <theholyduck> :P
[09:51:12] <Cryowolf> I've been on Oxycodone since Dec last year
[09:51:21] <Cryowolf> gonna take awhile to taper off later
[09:51:23] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: sure but you are like literally killing your body with chemicals
[09:51:27] <emmeka> I've been meaning to pick that up actually Cryowolf, but it sounds like a stretch to call it isekai.
[09:51:29] <theholyduck> seems reasonable 
[09:51:46] <emmeka> not everything with an alternate dimension is isekai, afterall
[09:51:46] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, dude...Im already dying
[09:51:51] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: exactly
[09:52:03] <theholyduck> dying from cancer and dying from the posiions to kill the cancer
[09:52:12] <theholyduck> seems like agreat reason to be on heavy narcotics to me
[09:52:22] <Cryowolf> Im not gonna stop taking something painkillers that keep my pain down and myself more functional
[09:52:27] <Cryowolf> yeah
[09:52:32] <Cryowolf> it is :P
[09:52:32] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: im not even remotely suggesting you should :P
[09:52:41] <Cryowolf> my bad then
[09:52:52] <Cryowolf> but now Imma eat something cause theres a break in my nausea
[09:52:53] <Cryowolf> brb
[09:53:04] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  my point was you are allready literally taking literal poision. so you might as well take some oxy to cope with that
[09:53:37] <Matt|home> can't fucking sleep..
[09:53:50] <theholyduck> try changing your nick to matt|sleep
[09:53:54] <theholyduck> maybe that will help
[09:54:42] <Matt|home> woke up three times.. exhausted but brain keeps going
[09:58:31] <theholyduck> my trick for that. put on an audiobook i have allready listened to or a podcast episode i dont care that much about 
[09:58:41] <theholyduck> leave it on at a low-ish volume and fall asleep tho that
[09:59:01] <theholyduck> ive been using the same audiobook to fall asleep for like the last 3 months because of how soothing i find the guys voice
[10:00:35] <theholyduck> just having like a monologue going on in the background that i can just barely pay attention to is what silences my brain when it wants to go racing atleast

[10:44:24] <theholyduck> as far as i can tell its the same as mine but with a different top layer design to give different support at different points
[10:44:25] <Cryowolf> I wanted to go all out since it was 50% off and I havent bought a new one in.....so long
[10:44:37] <theholyduck> based on the cutaway they show
[10:44:42] <Cryowolf> it has comfort zones, so different density points

[10:45:02] <Cryowolf> indeed
[10:45:22] <theholyduck> otherwise i probably would have gotten the top model. they were both good i was just worried it would clash with the bedframe i chose

[10:47:59] <Cryowolf> and it's not thick enough to be insulating
[10:48:05] <theholyduck> and seems sort of sad to block that off with 3cm of polyester
[10:48:08] <Cryowolf> 3.5cms, just barely
[10:48:11] <theholyduck> i mean 3cm of polyester is thicker than my blanket
[10:48:12] <theholyduck> by a lot
[10:48:30] <Cryowolf> It's not gonna change much of anything
[10:49:07] <theholyduck> i think it will but whatever :P 
[10:49:51] <Cryowolf> the cold foam will shape together with the air memory
[10:49:58] <theholyduck> i mean the SHAPE part
[10:50:00] <theholyduck> will work just fine i think
[10:50:10] <theholyduck> mostly anyway
[10:50:33] <Cryowolf> not just mostly, it will entirely. You generally don't sleep on the foam mattress directly
[10:50:48] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  i mean. you dont in that thing
[10:50:49] <theholyduck> is the point
[10:50:55] <Cryowolf> I intend to buy a memory foam bed mattress later, one of the thicker ones
[10:51:01] <Cryowolf> yes you do
[10:51:04] <theholyduck> it has like a big layer of foam and then it has a built in like cooling layer
[10:51:07] <Cryowolf> they literally told me you do
[10:51:21] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  i mean you dont as in
[10:51:22] <theholyduck> you do
[10:51:29] <theholyduck> normally you might not sleep on a foam matress directly 
[10:51:33] <theholyduck> but that thing is clearly set up to do so
[10:51:35] <Cryowolf> the cooling layer will cool it even if my skin isnt in direct contact
[10:51:48] <theholyduck> i mean some sheets wont matter
[10:52:00] <theholyduck> but like i can tell you even sleeping my blanket between the matress and it
[10:52:02] <theholyduck> has a noticable effect
[10:52:06] <theholyduck> on the "feel" of it
[10:52:08] <Cryowolf> lets just agree to disagree
[10:52:13] <Cryowolf> cause this is getting tedious
[10:52:23] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: im the one whos been sleeping ontop of a bareback one of basicly those matresses for over a year
[10:52:34] <theholyduck> saying even a blanket blocks the effect somewhat
[10:52:43] <theholyduck> and i dont use a thick blanket
[10:52:54] <theholyduck> "bareback" isnt right :P i use sheets
[10:53:01] <theholyduck> but no over-matress
[10:53:20] <theholyduck> it has a built in over-matress basicly in terms of that top cooling/memoryfoam thing
[10:53:27] <Cryowolf> so youre not gonna agree to disagree? Then I'll take the 2nd option and exit this topic
[10:53:41] <theholyduck> im appealing to my experience !
[10:53:48] <theholyduck> either way it is nice and comfy
[10:53:59] <theholyduck> come back here in 100 days when you can take the top layer off and we will talk then :D
[10:54:03] <Cryowolf> I dont care, can't you see I'm trying to politely tell you I don't want to talk about it or discuss it?
[10:54:50] <theholyduck> :(
[10:57:38] <Cryowolf> I need new legs for my elastic bottom. Or I need to find the missing screws for my continental bed frame
[11:02:54] <Cryowolf> I wish I had a streaming audience and could make money that way but the second I do something in return for just one donation, they turn from tax-free gifts into taxed "services"
[11:03:00] <Cryowolf> Swedish IRS...evil

[12:12:38] <Bco1981> yes, going as bare as possible

[12:30:57] <Bco1981> WD Green

[12:47:17] <KatrinValerie> Can I tweak this even further?
[12:47:22] <Bco1981> probably the disk can't write faster then 72MB/s
[12:47:55] <Bco1981> if you go ssd to ssd over 1gig lan... that lanport will be busy...
[12:50:48] <KatrinValerie> I think it's hdd to ssd right now
[12:50:57] <KatrinValerie> oh no hdd to hdd because my home drive is on an hdd
[12:51:09] <Bco1981> then that could be why
[12:51:11] <KatrinValerie> I still did not get around installing the m.2 sata ssd
[12:51:24] <Bco1981> and many small files will kill transfer rates
[12:51:25] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: the server has the files on a hdd
[12:51:38] <KatrinValerie> Don't know if it's in a raid setup yet or not
[12:51:52] <KatrinValerie> It's my girlfriends machine after all
[12:54:02] <Bco1981> i have this 1 machine that has 4x4TB disks in motherboard raid5... and the speed... there isn't any it's so bad that cd-roms would be faster.
[12:55:07] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: does it have a server grade raid controller though?
[12:55:08] <Bco1981> it was disks i recieved from a old netflix caching server from my previous work... so i suspected them to be in pretty bad shape. but smartinfo says they have barely been used.
[12:55:13] <Bco1981> no
[12:55:24] <Bco1981> just a onboard chipset raid thing
[12:55:30] <KatrinValerie> My girlfriend has one in one of the pcie slots I think
[12:55:40] <Bco1981> i should breake the raid and just run them independtly
[12:55:49] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: unless it's a server board that's just a glorified softraid
[12:56:05] <KatrinValerie> but tbh I prefer softraids anyways
[12:56:07] <Bco1981> yeah it's just a desktop mobo
[12:56:24] <KatrinValerie> using like logical volume manager and things
[12:57:04] <KatrinValerie> okay, finished copying fallout new vegas from my girlfriends computer
[12:57:07] <KatrinValerie> huehuehuehue

[13:01:08] <KatrinValerie> wow this is pretty fast
[13:01:19] <Bco1981> even windows software raid would be faster then this crap.
[13:01:31] <KatrinValerie> I should have copied the installer, the game itself does not want to run like that

[14:19:51] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: https://www.techsupportall.com/what-is-fast-boot-in-windows-10-and-how-to-disable-enable-it/
[14:19:52] <ImoutoBot> [title] How to Enable / Disable Fast Boot in Windows 10 (Fast Startup)
[14:20:05] <Bco1981> If you are a normal user and shutdown your computer properly after you have done your work, but if the FAST BOOT is enabled on your computer then it doesn’t shutdown completely, it seems like hibernation.
[14:20:15] <Bco1981> powercfg -h off disables hibernate
[14:20:46] <Bco1981> Windows update, which needs a complete shutdown, could be stuck in this fastboot mode.
[14:20:58] <Bco1981> To solve this complication, you just need to restart your computer instead of shutting down.
[14:21:34] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[14:21:41] <KatrinValerie> This makes me hate windows even more
[14:21:53] <Bco1981> have you tried turning it off and on again ????
[14:21:58] <KatrinValerie> I think I will just purrge it off of my drive
[14:24:05] <Bco1981> yeah... finally found the place... i don't have the fastboot option, it's not even there.
[14:24:48] <KatrinValerie> Anyways, I am sleepy and it's just noon

[18:07:06] <loveorcognac> shorter versions of longer phrases
[18:07:12] <Cryowolf> I prefer shortening it as much as possible. Especially if I'm going to learn the language
[18:07:14] <Bco1981> might aswell just go, osu
[18:07:24] <Cryowolf> because it's easier to think in a language if it's more casual imo
[18:07:28] <Bco1981> like "yo"
[18:07:38] <Cryowolf> and once you start thinking in a language, you can start speaking in it a lot better

[18:13:45] <Cryowolf> if you don't, you'll be frowned upon

[18:15:22] <Bco1981> it's expected.
[18:15:46] <Cryowolf> and if youre gonna open a can of surströmming, do it underwater. Because the fermenting process continues in the sealed can and will cause an explosion of fluids
[18:15:54] <Cryowolf> and good luck getting that stench out
[18:16:03] <Cryowolf> so you open it underwater
[18:17:12] <loveorcognac> I think it's time to stop making more of that fermented fish
[18:17:44] <Cryowolf> nah, imagine if its the end of the world and you have people trying to invade your home or base
[18:18:00] <Cryowolf> but, put some surströmming in opened cans here and there
[18:18:06] <Cryowolf> spray it around a bit

[18:18:35] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, you get used to it
[18:18:39] <Cryowolf> because you eat it
[18:18:47] <Bco1981> have to burn the place down to get rid of the smell
[18:18:50] <Cryowolf> and gain surströmming resistance, it's a special perk

[18:19:20] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: Japanese people also make it easier for the waitress to pick up the dishes when you leave the table
[18:19:36] <Cryowolf> amigojapan and they don't tip. Neither do Swedes typically
[18:19:51] <Cryowolf> the service fee is contained in the price
[18:20:11] <amigojapan> Right Cryowolf 
[18:20:18] <Cryowolf> I don't undertand American tipping culture. I think it's ultimately a bad thing
[18:20:30] <Cryowolf> it encourages employers to pay less salary
[18:20:52] <Cryowolf> because they make the service staff make up the difference with tips
[18:22:19] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, If I remember right, it's disliked, frowned upon and rejected in Japan because it implies your value is being judged through the tipping and that you are placed in judgement against your colleagues
[18:23:01] <Cryowolf> and service quality isn't supposed to be decided by tipping, every customer is a valued customer

[18:27:18] <Cryowolf> I prefer to eat at a steak house than a famous restaurant
[18:27:30] <Cryowolf> a T-Bone or Ribeye steak
[18:27:32] <Cryowolf> mmmm
[18:27:59] <amigojapan> I have never seen a tbone in Japan. I miss that
[18:28:24] <Cryowolf> but you have wagyu
[18:28:36] <Cryowolf> it looks so delicious
[18:28:42] <Cryowolf> and I will probably never eat it in my life
[18:28:58] <Cryowolf> how marbled it is and how easy the fat melts
[18:29:07] <amigojapan> Yup, pros and cons I guess
[18:29:30] <Cryowolf> and I dont see why they cant cut out the t-bone from a regular cow
[18:29:54] <amigojapan> I guess it is just not a custom
[18:30:11] <Cryowolf> but I would likely become a regular at a handfl of ramen stalls
[18:30:22] <Cryowolf> spaced far enough apart
[18:31:02] <Cryowolf> Unless I have a nice kitchen
[18:31:09] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: tips are dumb, but the restaurant shouldn't be making any money from them
[18:31:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: waiters are underpaid because it's expected they make some money from tips
[18:31:30] <TsundereNoises> also good morning
[18:31:46] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, but that's backwards
[18:32:01] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I mean yes, I think we should just pay waiters more
[18:32:05] <TsundereNoises> but that's not the world we live in
[18:32:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I meant the waiters are not getting paid fairly
[18:32:20] <Cryowolf> adding a service fee to the product, whatever it is would be better. Then that service fee is used for a higher salary
[18:32:24] <TsundereNoises> and it's not nice to fuck over waiters as some attempt to make a political/societal point
[18:32:37] <TsundereNoises> especially since, when you're only fucking over the waiters, you aren't actually accomplishing anything 
[18:32:56] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, no but in my case it would be more like "I dont have money, I wasn't expecting to pay ANOTHER 15%"
[18:33:25] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: looks like each country has their own way of cutting, fx. a pair of danish cooks visited americ and went to a butcher, they had to tell the guy to cut like this, here and here to get what they wanted. to make a danish dish in the american danish town. The guy looked at them very weirdly.
[18:33:27] <Cryowolf> its pretty much only the US that does this
[18:34:55] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, lol. I used to go across Öresund to eat Hackebiff, the one where they are cooked for a long time in those shaped frying pans with large slices of onion in them etc
[18:35:20] <Cryowolf> there was this one restaurant in Helsingör and oh my god they made the best hackebiff
[18:35:38] <TsundereNoises> !later tell Urchin[emacs] That comic is absolutely canon K-on, it's a shame it wasn't in the anime
[18:35:55] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: there must be more onions then beef...
[18:36:12] <Bco1981> and drenched in brown sauce
[18:36:19] <Cryowolf> yes
[18:36:39] <Cryowolf> with mashed potato and lumps of potato in them. Some lingon on the side
[18:36:46] <Bco1981> yes
[18:37:02] <Cryowolf> and some red "cole slaw" or whatever you call it
[18:37:05] <Cryowolf> when you use the red one
[18:37:40] <Cryowolf> and then you can dig in and learn that you dont need to pay premium to get some of the best food on the planet

[20:39:06] <SpiritOfSummer> OjousamaNoises: how does text disgust you
[20:40:06] <OjousamaNoises>  SpiritOfSummer because the whole fun thing about quotes is that they trigger people's memories of whatever funny thing you said, maybe out of context, maybe not
[20:40:41] <OjousamaNoises> so adding lame quotes to yourself just kind of ruins the fun thing about them

[20:43:15] <SpiritOfSummer> so I don't think other people are the best at saving somebody's best quotes either

[20:51:02] <OjousamaNoises> WWJ!AQ
[20:51:30] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: but actually, I do think others are better than ourselves at choosing, it's just that too many people are inattentive and don't really add any quotes at all
[20:51:42] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: but if you see a really lame quote, there's like a 90% chance someone added it to themselves
[20:52:07] <OjousamaNoises> and likewise, sometimes I've thought something wasn't the funnier part of what I said, but then thinking back on it later, I agree with the person who quoted me
[20:52:21] <SpiritOfSummer> well the thing is
[20:52:27] <OjousamaNoises> I think that distance can really help, otherwise quotes become very ego-driven
[20:52:49] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: I will absolutely !addquote you the next time you make me laugh though
[20:52:51] <SpiritOfSummer> it's possible I find myself funnier than others do 
[20:52:54] <OjousamaNoises> although really I probably would anyway
[20:53:00] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: which is somewhat my point
[20:53:09] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: but sometimes you might also only be funny at the wrong times
[20:53:20] <SpiritOfSummer> and so funny quotes saved by others will be more what everybody finds funny about you instead of you to yourself 
[20:53:38] <OjousamaNoises> like I think me, ButterNoodle, Urchin, and one other person I can't remember add more quotes than most of the other users combined
[20:53:56] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: yes, but that's exactly WHY I think that's a better system
[20:54:10] <OjousamaNoises> you come in and imoutobot greets you with a quote, it reminds people who you are a bit
[20:54:33] <SpiritOfSummer> to be honest I can see people getting carried the hell away with saving their own stuff too
[20:54:56] <OjousamaNoises> SpiritOfSummer: oh yeah, there are some people with a bunch of quotes added to themselves, and most of them are so lame

[20:57:39] <name100> wa ka ri ma shi ta
