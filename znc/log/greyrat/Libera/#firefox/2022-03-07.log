[02:34:25] <t4nk_freenode> https://devtoolstips.org/tips/en/disable-event-listeners/ according to that page you can disable event listeners by unchecking them in the list
[02:34:40] <t4nk_freenode> I don't have any checkboxes to uncheck
[02:35:06] <t4nk_freenode> using 97.0.1 on linux

[02:39:45] <t4nk_freenode> so I can just use the context menu to copy text, but I don't really understand how it works with these evenlisteners
[02:40:49] <t4nk_freenode> I've used some code like scriptCode.push('function disableSelection(e){}');, I guess it overrides the existing one and does nothing

[13:41:23] <mimorek> Croran: Caspy7[m] : What do you mean by "bridge"?
[13:57:56] <Caspy7[m]> mimorek: a way to let people connected to one network chat in rooms of another network.
[13:57:56] <Caspy7[m]> I'm currently connected to a Matrix server but I'm able to chat on this IRC server via a bridge
[14:00:30] <mimorek> Caspy7[m]: Ok thanks. That's new to me.
[14:02:29] <Caspy7[m]> another advantage in this case is that matrix keeps a history/scrollback for most rooms so in here I can see the scrollback whenever I reconnect
[14:03:42] <Caspy7[m]> been a while since I've assessed the state of IRC so I don't know if most libera supports that (3.0 or something?) or if most IRC clients do too
[14:10:28] <Croran> hmm i need to create an account? what's 'continue with SAML'?
[14:12:37] <mimorek> <Caspy7[m]> another advantage in this case is that matrix keeps a history/scrollback for most rooms so in here I can see the scrollback whenever I reconnect   >> Isn't that what every irc client does (depending on the configuration ofcourse)?
[14:13:19] <mimorek> Caspy7[m]: Is this what you mean: https://matrix.org ?
[14:14:21] <Caspy7[m]> Croran: I don't remember or know SAML, but I think when you use the single sign on that it simply utilizes the method you choose (like github) to authenticate, then you choose a username. So perhaps it's account creation in some sense, but no need to choose a password or remember a new username
[14:15:30] <Caspy7[m]> mimorek: as I said, it's been a while for me with IRC, but my long experience for many years was that if you aren't connected then no, you can't see conversation that happened while you were disconnected
[14:16:16] <Caspy7[m]> mimorek: yes, there are multiple matrix servers on the net, they are federated (connected) together so you can connect to one and then chat on any of them
[14:16:43] <Caspy7[m]> mozilla.org has their own server, and then there's matrix too
[14:17:38] <Caspy7[m]> the main way many will connect to mozilla's is through https://chat.mozilla.org/ - this is nice as it's approachable for non-techie folk who are looking for support, for instance
[14:18:25] <Caspy7[m]> both that and https://matrix.org/ use the "Element" web client, though there are other standalone Matrix clients
[14:21:01] <mimorek> Caspy7[m]: Ok thanks.
[14:22:38] <Caspy7[m]> Matrix also allows for inline images and link previews (think twitter-style article info) and finer grained room controls like whether these are allowed
