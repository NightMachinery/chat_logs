[00:04:32] <xnaas> was looking at the RHEL-based stuff more
[00:04:41] <xnaas> didn't realize they were still on 4.x kernel
[00:04:42] * bookworm shudders
[00:04:48] <xnaas> even more behind than Debian!
[00:04:48] <xnaas> lol
[00:05:07] <bookworm> centos is essentially rhel fwiw, or well, was
[00:05:14] <bookworm> now they have CentOS stream
[00:05:52] <fnutt> Does anyone of you have Don't Starve Together game and can please help me test if my self-hosted server is listed and possible to join? (on PC/Mac/Linux)
[00:05:58] <fnutt> Pretty please.
[00:05:58] <xnaas> Yeah, "CentOS Linux" was killed off (7 supported for several years still) in favor of CentOS Stream.
[00:06:37] <fnutt> Wondering if my port forwarding is good.
[00:06:43] <xnaas> https://xnaas.info/tmp/sre.webp negative, ghost rider
[00:06:46] <bookworm> I'm afraid my laptop only has the intel integrated graphics... anything more than stardew valley I can't play
[00:07:34] <Activ8> Don't Starve Together ? what is this lol
[00:07:53] <Activ8> a steam game, no thanks ill pass
[00:08:13] <fnutt> https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/
[00:08:25] <fnutt> I was hoping someone here had the game.
[00:09:39] <xnaas> You hate Valve, the company responsible for Linux gaming finally coming into viability in the last few years? lol
[00:10:33] <xnaas> fnutt: https://xnaas.info/tmp/ips.webp evidently I know a lot of people who have it...but I don't myself. ðŸ˜¬
[00:11:20] <xnaas> One of them is playing ARK right now...I could check if they're available to check for you? ðŸ˜…
[00:39:47] <ska> Activ8: What platform to use, what to avoid, what options are cost effective and easy to maintain. That type of advice.
[00:40:23] <ska> I'm interested in subscription-based platform, that only delivers digital content.
[00:41:12] <fnutt> Donâ€™t worry xnaas. But thanks. 
[00:41:38] <xnaas> aight
[00:41:58] <Activ8> ska you can do it with wordpress but may be better with a proper shop based model.  Any will do you can get plugins for download platforms now
[00:52:23] <ska> Activ8: I saw wordpress based solution but was worried about dealing with maintenance and security etc. 
[00:52:46] <Activ8> you get the same with all websites, you still have to maintain
[00:53:29] <ska> Even on Shopify for example?
[00:57:43] <Activ8> yeh sure they still have plugins
[00:57:52] <Activ8> they bring security updates out and what not every now n again
[00:58:01] <Activ8> every online store requires plugin updates once in a while
[00:59:18] <ska> They don't manage those updates?
[01:03:06] <Activ8> who?
[01:03:44] <Activ8> you can auto-update in wordpress now if you want there's an option there so you don't have to but I personally would never auto update as there's far more chance of something breaking on a custom store
[01:03:52] <ska> I thought Shopify would do maintenance on all those pluggins.
[01:05:50] <Activ8> the devs yeh they all do
[01:06:23] <Activ8> you still have to maintain your own site, unless your paying someone to maintain and secure it
[01:08:50] <Activ8> I look after 2 wordpress online stores now and I built them both and get paid to maintain them

[02:36:24] <johncs> i consulted with some local tax folks, but they didn't know enough about international businesses
[02:36:50] <johncs> i feel like one of them should've known about EU VAT at least though ðŸ˜­. all well... i won't be particularly late, if at all
