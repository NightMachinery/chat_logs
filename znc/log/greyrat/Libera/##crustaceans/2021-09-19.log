[00:02:50] <buttsbot> 10/10 attempt to make the ugliest house imaginable : McMansionHell
[00:04:02] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[00:29:33] <quanticle> I have to say, while I *appreciate* McMansionHell, I don't understand it. The people who build and buy these houses like them. And it's not like a bunch of rando redditors making fun of them is going to stop them from buying existing McMansions or building new ones. So... what's the point? Why subject yourself to this ugliness?
[00:30:08] <ngoldbaum> the lulz
[00:30:18] <manicennui> quanticle: What's the point of all of the complaining we do on the Internet?
[00:30:23] <manicennui> It is how we cope.
[00:30:33] <manicennui> And the rest of us have to look at these shitty houses in our neighborhoods.
[00:30:41] <manicennui> Not that people do that shit in my neibhorhood.
[00:31:14] <quanticle> Yeah, but like... it's one thing to complain about technology. Technology is our job. We're subjected to the ugliness, whether we want to be or not. But this? This is verging on specifically going out and finding things to be mad at.
[00:31:17] <quanticle> Why?
[00:31:38] <quanticle> Like people want to live in shitty houses? Okay.
[00:31:42] <quanticle> What's it to you?
[00:31:52] <quanticle> It's a free country
[00:32:03] <riv> its funny :D
[00:32:35] <riv> i think i read a really good analysis of it recently actually
[00:32:39] <riv> probably someone in here linked it
[00:32:47] <riv> but i forgot the details
[00:33:03] <manicennui> quanticle: Again, it wouldn't matter as much if we didn't have to look at their shitty houses.
[00:33:19] <manicennui> But I don't understand why you believe that complaining about tech isn't any less inane.
[00:33:47] <manicennui> s/isn't/is/
[00:34:31] <manicennui> I also happen to believe that architecture has a big impact on us.
[00:35:02] <quanticle> >And the rest of us have to look at these shitty houses in our neighborhoods
[00:35:04] <quanticle> Right, that's my point. These houses *aren't* in your neighborhood. I've looked at the Zillow listings for some of them and they're all like *at least* 800,000. Most of 'em are over a million. And we're not talking a million dollars in California, no, it's like a million dollars in podunk nowheresville. So unless you're both seriously rich and living in like Arizona or Texas, you have nothing
[00:35:05] <manicennui> There is a reason why we enjoy looking at photographs of Amsterdamn, and I believe it contributes to their happiness.
[00:35:06] <quanticle> to worry about w.r.t. McMansion hell. And if you *are* a millionaire living in Arizona or Texas, hell, you're probably looking at these houses and thinking, "Hey, these are some great ideas!"
[00:36:17] <manicennui> quanticle: The suburbs here are filled with McMansions.
[00:36:23] <manicennui> You don't have to be rich.
[00:36:28] <manicennui> And many of us in tech basically are rich.
[00:38:01] <mouseghost> ok so give me money
[00:38:13] <manicennui> In exchange for what?
[00:39:44] <quanticle> I feel like Neal Stephenson captured this attitude in _In The Beginning Was The Command Line_: "Nothing is more annoying to sophisticated people to see someone who is rich enough to know better being tacky--unless it is to realize, a moment later, that they probably know they are tacky and they simply don't care and they are going to go on being tacky, and rich, and happy, forever. Microsoft
[00:39:46] <quanticle> therefore bears the same relationship to the Silicon Valley elite as the Beverly Hillbillies did to their fussy banker, Mr. Drysdale--who is irritated not so much by the fact that the Clampetts moved to his neighborhood as by the knowledge that, when Jethro is seventy years old, he's still going to be talking like a hillbilly and wearing bib overalls, and he's still going to be a lot richer
[00:39:48] <quanticle> than Mr. Drysdale."
[00:40:31] <manicennui> I don't get it.
[00:40:46] <manicennui> I don't think anyone in that subreddit expects to change the minds of rich tacky people.
[00:40:50] <goodger> amsterdamn?
[00:41:26] <manicennui> Sorry for the mispelling.
[00:41:30] <manicennui> misspelling
[00:42:18] <quanticle> No, that's the point
[00:42:33] <quanticle> They're not going to change the minds of rich people who build McMansions
[00:42:41] <quanticle> That's *why* they get annoyed
[00:42:42] <manicennui> And I don't think they believe they will.
[00:42:45] <manicennui> So what's the problem?
[00:43:00] <manicennui> quanticle: I think your problem is that you think the things you get annoyed with are somehow more important.
[00:43:42] <manicennui> That you are somehow different for complaining about the "right" things.
[00:43:57] <manicennui> Nearly everyone bitches about shit they can't hope to change.
[00:44:08] <manicennui> It's clearly a way of coping.
[00:44:14] <manicennui> What more is there to understand?
[00:44:49] <riv> https://commonedge.org/architecture-aesthetic-moralism-and-the-crisis-of-urban-housing/ she writes interesting stuff
[00:44:50] <buttsbot> Architecture, Aesthetic Moralism, and the Crisis of Urban Housing – Common Edge
[00:44:52] <manicennui> This channel is like 75% bitching about shit we won't change.
[00:45:09] <riv> frustrating that i cna't find that post i was thinking of though
[00:45:49] <goodger> quanticle: one thing you have to learn about this channel is that manicennui is an unstoppable force of mindless pseudo-controversial blather
[00:46:14] <goodger> complaining doesn't alter it
[00:46:15] * manicennui pats goodger on the head.
[00:49:01] <quanticle> lol
[00:49:22] <gerikson> quanticle: Reddit is entertaining
[00:49:40] <quanticle> Wait, did you suggest that manicennui is the McMansion of ##crustaceans
[00:49:40] <gerikson> someone finds it fun to look at Zillow listings and write snarky on pics
[00:49:43] <quanticle> That's a bit harsh innit
[00:49:46] <gerikson> others find it fun to read
[00:49:57] <gerikson> *shrug*
[00:50:18] <manicennui> quanticle: goodger is just an angry cunt. He has no other emotions.
[00:54:21] <goodger> pretty soon this channel's going to be more ignored than not
[00:55:28] <manicennui> riv: This article is decent. I agree with the author for the most part. I think this is actually related to the subreddit in question too though.
[00:56:10] <manicennui> The best submissions are ones where not only is the place ugly, but it is unnecessarily large, using far more resources than are needed by a family, usually including a huge lawn that must be maintained.
[00:56:18] <manicennui> And they often have bad functional design.
[00:57:44] <manicennui> I see these buildings that are mentioned in Chicago, and frankly they aren't even as ugly as half the shit that gets built in the suburbs, and they tend to be far denser.
[00:57:51] <manicennui> They aren't affordable though.
[00:57:56] <manicennui> Basically nothing affordable gets built.
[00:58:04] <edk> there are lots of classy mansions that equal them in extravagance, though
[00:58:14] <edk> and in general i think we don't find that as offensive
[00:58:42] <manicennui> edk: A lot of submissions on that sub are just huge compounds that aren't especially ugly.
[00:59:04] <gerikson> there's a banality of bad design
[01:00:35] <edk> manicennui: i don't really read that sub so i can't comment i guess
[01:01:04] <manicennui> Pfft. That's not how the Internet works. Comment away.
[01:02:19] <edk> okay. having spent almost a minute skimming through the submissions there, my authoritative opinion is that /r/McMansionHell is quite appreciative of excessive mansions as long as they have good architecture
[01:02:47] <manicennui> Yeah, it is about aesthetics for the most part.
[01:03:04] <manicennui> But they do tend to point out bad functional design from time to time.
[01:03:20] <manicennui> I wouldn't take it seriously as commentary on architecture or housing development in general.
[01:06:44] <manicennui> I'd fully support a series of really plain buildings being built in Chicago in an effort to create some affordable housing, but they would probably not actually be affordable, and when they are affordable they often turn into crime-infested areas of the city.
[01:07:08] <manicennui> A mixed affordability building seems like it might solve that problem.
[01:07:31] <manicennui> But the affordable units would have to be regulated to prevent people with money from buying them.
[01:07:57] <manicennui> I really think the true solution to affordable housing is to tax the fuck out of non-primary residences.
[01:08:30] <manicennui> The transition would be the hard part, but it should prevent housing from becoming another investment tool for the rich.
[01:09:03] <edk> honestly i'm all in favour of taxing the fuck out of anything a median income family can't afford
[01:09:14] <riv> +1
[01:10:33] <manicennui> edk: I think taxing non-primary residences would have more support.
[01:10:35] <jjuran> Perhaps the value of pointing out the poor taste of the McMansion owners is a means of asserting superiority.  In other words, even though they have the money to own such a place and we don't, we're the better folks for not doing so.
[01:10:51] <manicennui> jjuran: I mean, I'm clearly superior.
[01:11:13] <manicennui> Joking aside, I think shitting on other people to make oneself feel superior is a common human trait.
[01:11:33] <riv> jjuran, yes this is what the article i had read was saying
[01:11:39] <manicennui> I don't really have a problem with the less fortunate shitting on the rich.
[01:11:52] <riv> it's also kind of a coping mechanism for not being able to afford them, (even though they suck)
[01:12:10] <manicennui> Do I get a pass if I can afford some of them?
[01:12:18] <edk> no you get eaten
[01:12:25] <manicennui> There are some massive houses in that sub that are only $600-800k.
[01:12:39] <manicennui> Which I find surprising, even out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:12:58] <manicennui> Like 6k+ square foot monsters.
[01:12:59] <edk> jjuran: to me that "even though" suggests the default assumption would be that those who have money are better
[01:13:33] <edk> manicennui: and as for the other thing, i agree with that, i'm just saying i'd also agree with any other tax that mostly affects the wealthy
[01:13:59] <manicennui> edk: I think that tax would need to be defined at the county or even city level.
[01:14:41] <manicennui> At the federal level it would have to be fairly high to not affect people living in places like NYC or SF who aren't actually wealthy.
[01:14:57] <manicennui> Biden's cutoff of $400k seems fair.
[01:15:05] <edk> i wasn't really thinking you'd implement it as one tax, more as a rule of thumb. i do see what you mean, but there's another angle to it
[01:15:22] <manicennui> But property taxes are already set locally.
[01:15:27] <manicennui> And directly address the problem.
[01:15:40] <manicennui> You could even lower property taxes for primary residences and still make it work.
[01:16:01] <manicennui> After you price out most investors you'd probably have to reconsider it.
[01:16:01] <edk> yes, they only address the problem if they disproportionately affect property that is not a primary residence
[01:16:27] <edk> you could make the argument property taxes that don't do that are regressive even
[01:16:58] <edk> but the other angle is that taxes are like insurance; they work by averaging
[01:17:15] <manicennui> In planning my escape from the 9-to-5 work life, I've been thinking a lot about the fact that if I stay here, I'll likely be paying over $1k a month for property taxes and association fees even if I manage to pay a place off.
[01:17:35] <edk> if you make the local adjustment resolution too fine even most wealthy people will be in wealthy neighbourhoods where they're not particularly wealthy
[01:17:52] <edk> that's quite a bit
[01:18:11] <manicennui> Cook County has really high taxes.
[01:18:30] <manicennui> And you can't really buy a decent condo here for less than several hundred thousand.
[01:19:04] <manicennui> When I look at real estate in North Carolina, the low property taxes always seem insane.
[01:19:18] <manicennui> And is a big reason why I'm still considering moving there.
[01:19:19] <edk> i'm no stranger to high house prices in cities but the property tax surprises me a bit
[01:21:16] <manicennui> edk: I paid $290k for my place. The property taxes are over $5k per year, and the association fee is currently about $320 per month.
[01:21:28] <manicennui> And my place is less than 1000 square feet.
[01:21:46] <manicennui> It's not a bad place, but I wouldn't want to live here long term.
[01:21:50] <manicennui> There are also no amenities.
[01:22:08] <manicennui> The association fee is that high because it is a really old building.
[01:22:10] <edk> see the price sounds entirely reasonable to me; london will do that to you
[01:22:20] <manicennui> edk: Sure, it is reasonable.
[01:22:35] <edk> the property tax less so
[01:22:42] <manicennui> But that is like $750 per month.
[01:22:54] <manicennui> Property taxes and association fee.
[01:23:36] <edk> that association fee seems horrible too but the property tax is the bit i really don't understand
[01:23:39] <manicennui> Buildings that are newer with the same level of amenities as this building will often be $200 per month or less for the association fee.
[01:23:47] <manicennui> edk: Cook County
[01:23:48] <edk> would the tax be lower too?
[01:23:55] <edk> it's graded by energy efficiency here
[01:24:24] <manicennui> https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-again-ranks-no-2-in-u-s-for-highest-property-taxes/
[01:24:24] <buttsbot> Illinois again ranks No. 2 in U.S. for highest property taxes
[01:24:41] <manicennui> edk: No, it would be higher assuming the unit is worth more.
[01:24:45] <manicennui> It's by value here.
[01:24:58] <manicennui> Here being all of the US AFAIK.
[01:25:11] <manicennui> I'm not aware of a county where it is done differently.
[01:25:14] <ngoldbaum> assessed value
[01:25:16] <manicennui> There are various discounts available.
[01:25:23] <ngoldbaum> which can deviate from the actual value
[01:25:26] <manicennui> Usually for old people.
[01:25:37] <manicennui> But we actually pay a company to dispute the taxes every where.
[01:25:45] <edk> we have discounts for old people, students, in london there's even one for single people
[01:25:49] <manicennui> The amount we pay the company is less than the amount we save.
[01:25:51] <manicennui> It is insane.
[01:25:52] <ngoldbaum> also don’t talk about the incredibly regressive horrible way california does property taxes
[01:25:56] <edk> and it's based on value too but there's also energy efficiency bands
[01:26:06] <ngoldbaum> also the rules about property twxes for golf
[01:27:41] <manicennui> There are a lot of reasons why I want to stay here, but property taxes and association fees on old buildings (which is much of Chicago) are reasons why I'd probably move.
[01:28:45] <manicennui> Unless I become far richer.
[01:28:51] <ngoldbaum> the way courts have decided things, because country clubs operate as a co-op, and because 51% change in ownership stake has never happened, the property taxes are still assessed at the *1976* value
[01:29:14] <edk> ngoldbaum: well that's... different
[01:29:37] <manicennui> I think there should be huge discounts for people who don't move for a long period of time.
[01:29:47] <edk> yeah, but emphasis on people
[01:29:53] <manicennui> People shouldn't have to pay outrageous property taxes just because their neighborhood gentrified.
[01:30:08] <manicennui> I know some of the senior discounts address this to some extent.
[01:30:42] <manicennui> I'm not a huge fan of taxing primary residences in general.
[01:31:13] <manicennui> And I think there is actually an argument to be made that it could seriously help the average person when they retire if they can stop paying them at some point.
[01:31:17] <edk> some counties consist pretty much entirely of primary residences
[01:31:36] <manicennui> We have a large number of different programs in the US to help people with various things.
[01:31:50] <manicennui> And I think a lot of them are dealing with the problems caused by other laws and regulations.
[01:32:00] <edk> there's not much geographic redistribution of wealth though
[01:32:06] <edk> or really any other redistribution of wealth
[01:33:16] <quanticle> "Create a problem, sell the solution" applies just as much to politics as it does to everything else
[01:33:17] <manicennui> In cook county, even if you own your home, you are unlikely to reduce your housing expenses below maybe $500 per month.
[01:33:30] <manicennui> This might seem cheap until you realize how little some people receive from social security.
[01:33:48] <kline> poor people shouldnt own homes, e z
[01:34:01] <manicennui> kline: We've pretty much achieved that.
[01:34:03] <riv> how else will we keep them poor
[01:34:27] <kline> (ha ha only serious, it would be seriously nice if we didnt have to use property as such a significant metric of success and store of value)
[01:34:39] <manicennui> For those of you not in the US, social security payouts are based on something like the average of your income for the last 10 years that you worked.
[01:34:43] <manicennui> And there is an overall cap.
[01:34:57] <edk> it would be nice if owning a home wasn't essential yes
[01:34:59] <manicennui> So if you never managed to make very much while working, you get to be fucked when you retire too.
[01:35:01] <edk> but it's a trap
[01:35:26] <edk> in order for home ownership to not be essential the renting market would need to not be exploitative
[01:35:34] <manicennui> To be clear, you don't receive the average of your income. The amount is just determined from that.
[01:35:37] <edk> in order for the renting market to not be exploitative homes would need to be easy to own
[01:35:43] <edk> homes are most people's primary appreciating asset
[01:35:52] <kline> (poor people shouldnt own homes, and neither should most people _need_ to generally, and the advantages of home ownership oughtnt be so beneficial as they are if we had better ways for people of all stripes to safely manage sub-house amounts of money without bleeding multiple house-amounts of capital over their lifetimes in rent)
[01:35:53] <manicennui> https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/Benefits.html
[01:35:54] <buttsbot> Social Security Benefit Amounts
[01:35:59] <edk> if that asset suddenly became easy to acquire it would lose value
[01:36:09] <manicennui> Social Security benefits are typically computed using "average indexed monthly earnings." This average summarizes up to 35 years of a worker's indexed earnings. We apply a formula to this average to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the basis for the benefits that are paid to an individual.
[01:36:15] <manicennui> I guess it is more than 10 years.
[01:36:20] <kline> >PIA
[01:36:20] <edk> so you'll never fix the house price problem politically, homeowners who are scared of negative equity will always stop you
[01:36:40] <edk> and because it's not fixed anyone who does manage to become a homeowner will keep that up
[01:36:53] <manicennui> I know people, including family members, who basically survive on SS.
[01:36:56] <edk> also in general i disagree with anything that starts "poor people shouldn't"
[01:36:57] <manicennui> It is not great.
[01:37:16] <quanticle> >ha ha only serious, it would be seriously nice if we didnt have to use property as such a significant metric of success and store of value
[01:37:18] <quanticle> I don't know, I think that this is just human nature. We've been using property as a metric of success and store of value since literally time immemorial. If anything, it's gotten better in recent times. Used to be, the *only* way you could get rich was to own a lot of property.
[01:37:26] <kline> edk, reverse right to buy scheme wherein you 1) make non-homeownership less of a big deal and then 2) allow release of equity by the govt buying up houses for social use
[01:37:30] <ngoldbaum> kline: i hear they offer a top tier vpn
[01:37:34] <manicennui> Especially when you consider the fact that Medicare, the health care program you are eligible for when you retire, also does not cover everything, so people have supplemental insurance.
[01:38:42] <manicennui> kline: There are a number of benefits to home ownership that have nothing to do with having a place to live, unfortunately.
[01:38:42] <edk> kline: i don't think that's fundamentally flawed but it would be spectacularly difficult to actually do and require a government with a 20-30 year view
[01:39:08] <manicennui> Most people are aware of the fact that interest can be deducted from taxable income to some extent.
[01:39:16] <manicennui> This actually helps me a lot. I always get money back.
[01:39:28] <manicennui> But you also have to consider what is happening when you rent.
[01:39:39] <kline> edk, yeah, and tbh 1. is a still a massive unsolved problem
[01:39:43] <manicennui> You are paying for a place for someone else, and they are increasing their capital.
[01:39:44] <kline> so its a bit like draw the circles
[01:39:47] <kline> then draw the rest of the owl
[01:39:51] <manicennui> Continuing the transfer of wealth.
[01:40:38] <edk> i'm paying a charity for mine, they use the profits to house people who can't afford it
[01:40:50] <manicennui> And if you manage to pay off your mortgage, your housing expenses will be much lower than if you were renting the same place.
[01:41:26] <manicennui> Also, rent increases in many areas easily exceed increases in property taxes each year.
[01:41:40] <manicennui> So you are locking in your housing costs to some extent, with smaller increases.

[02:48:17] <manicennui> I finished watching all available episodes of Attack on Titan. It is good, but definitely not my favorite.
[02:48:58] <manicennui> I think the dialogue is pretty bad for the most part.
[03:02:54] <kline> available where?
[03:03:08] <manicennui> First season is on Netflix.
[03:03:15] <manicennui> Entire series on Funimation.
[03:03:46] <manicennui> Also on Crunchyroll.
[03:03:58] <quanticle> And on a torrent site near you!
[03:04:31] <manicennui> Pretty sure you can watch it for free on Funimation/Crunchroll.
[03:04:37] <manicennui> Probably with ads.
[03:08:28] <kline> but the funimation/crunchyroll/netflix translations are generally not good, at best
[03:08:41] <kline> actively rewritten at worst
[03:10:49] <manicennui> Everyone gives Netflix a lot of shit about anime, but I generally find it far more enjoyable to watch anime when it is on Netflix, and not just because they are the only streaming company that is competent when it comes to software development.
[03:11:12] <manicennui> Granted I haven't watched dozens of series.

[03:44:13] <kline> manicennui, no problem, but generally netflix/cr are aiming for commercial success in a western market, and will significantly re-write dialogue to support that cause
[03:44:45] <kline> sometimes this is just to rewrite turns of phrase that dont translate well, but even at this level its been known to break injokes and call backs
[03:45:36] <kline> at worst, they deliberately rewrite for western palatability, which, right or wrong, can have a negative effect
[03:46:19] <kline> japan has different cultural mores. im not saying its right to directly bring across japanese content that might not be considered appropriate in the west, but in that case id rather they just didnt bring it over at all
[03:47:16] <kline> making a show shittier just so you can make more money without offending people or dumbing down cultural idioms that arent directly understood is bad practice
[03:47:53] <manicennui> Understood.

[03:48:25] <manicennui> I have a hard time judging people's complaints about how manga is adapted or translated because so many anime fans complain about the dumbest shit.
[03:48:57] <manicennui> "There is a panel in the manga where <minor character> smiles (which has no impact on anything. This totally ruins it."
[03:49:55] <manicennui> Sorry, implying that they left it out in the anime
[03:53:33] <quanticle> It's basically the same as the LotR fans complaining about how the movie left Tom Bombadil out
[03:57:01] <manicennui> Nah.
[03:57:19] <manicennui> Movies have to cut things, including characters.
[03:57:32] <edk> i don't often hear lotr fans complain about that
[03:57:41] <quanticle> I do
[03:58:03] <manicennui> But manga fans will find a single insignificant panel that adds absolutely nothing missing and act like it is one of the biggest problems with the anime.
[03:58:28] <quanticle> Yeah, not just manga fans
[03:58:30] <quanticle> Like
[03:58:33] <quanticle> All fandoms do that
[03:58:34] <manicennui> It would be more like if Peter Jackson cut a line of dialogue where Frodo said hello to Sam one time.
[03:58:37] <quanticle> Fantasy fandooms
[03:58:42] <quanticle> Comic fandoms
[03:58:54] <manicennui> Most of the complaints I see about LOTR seem like more significant changes that most don't matter.
[03:59:08] <manicennui> mostly
[03:59:42] <manicennui> I think the problem with Tom Bombadil is that most people who read the books don't even know why he was in them.
[04:00:59] <edk> yeah
[04:01:21] <manicennui> Not saying there isn't a reason, just that he is hard to figure out.
[04:01:32] <manicennui> I've read some plausible explanations.
[04:02:50] <manicennui> I've seen the thing I've describe for every action/shonen manga I've read about.

[04:03:08] <manicennui> SPOILERS
[04:03:21] <manicennui> Someone's laugh was not in the manga.
[04:03:31] <manicennui> The laugh was not at all important.
[04:03:55] <manicennui> "One of the most memorable moments of the series is Annie's creepy and shocking laugh"
[04:03:57] <manicennui> It really isn't.
[04:04:57] <manicennui> It was also not at all shocking.
[04:05:24] <manicennui> It might have been a bit out of character, but in the moment it seemed understandable and a reasonable reaction to the situation.
[04:05:53] <manicennui> And whether she laughed or not was not at all important to the story or anything else.
[04:06:36] <manicennui> I never thought about it again later.
[04:07:47] <manicennui> I saw similar comments about Fullmetal Alchemist.
[04:08:10] <quanticle> I guess my question is, like with the McMansions, why do you care?
[04:10:13] <kline>  manicennui | I have a hard time judging people's complaints about how manga is adapted or translated
[04:10:22] <kline> i get that, there are a lot of whiney tryhards
[04:11:40] <kline> im just suggesting that basing your opinion of a show through the most unashamedly mass-market-targeting for-profit enterprises is perhaps not going to reflect necessarily what a show is supposed to be
[04:12:44] <kline> tbh i think that aot is generally not an amazing show, but if youre interested in watching pretty much any foreign media, lowest barrier to entry equivalents of ultra-processed foods are not going to be the best representation

[04:20:16] <manicennui> kline: What do you suggest people do instead? Spend years learning Japanese to watch it in the original language?
[04:20:38] <edk> fansubs
[04:20:40] <manicennui> It's not as though the original wasn't made by a for-profit company.
[04:20:55] <manicennui> I'm guessing that many fan subs are just as bad.
[04:21:02] <quanticle> "Air for the crew was provided by a bleed air system on the engine compressors. This air was hot and had to be cooled before being pumped into the cockpit. This cooling was provided by a large total-loss evaporator running on a mixture of 40% ethanol and 60% distilled water (effectively vodka). This system garnered the aircraft one of its many nicknames, the 'supersonic booze carrier'. As the
[04:21:04] <quanticle> system vented the coolant after use it was possible that the aircraft could run out during flight, and comfort had to be balanced by the possibility of running out of coolant. Numerous cases of Tu 22 crews drinking the coolant mixture and becoming paralytically drunk led to a crackdown by Soviet Air Force authorities. Access to the bombers after flights was restricted, and more frequent
[04:21:06] <quanticle> checks were made on coolant levels. This higher level of security, however, did not end the practice outright."

[04:21:19] <kline> fansubs dont have a commercial incentive to rewrite
[04:21:39] <kline> some fansubs are garbage, some are just bad, some put in deliberate rewrite for comedic character
[04:21:47] <kline> so sure, pick your fave
[04:22:19] <quanticle> "Boris turn down the A/C we need to save the booze for the post mission party!"
[04:23:50] <manicennui> And the source of fansubs is going to be piracy, which I don't support.
[04:24:35] <kline> western fansub piracy steals essentially 0% of the market
[04:24:46] <dimadima> good evening EDT
[04:24:47] <edk> i do think cr and netflix have an incentive to modify anime into inoffensive corporate slop which, while it may also exist in the country of origin, is at least tempered there by the creators' involvement in the process
[04:24:59] <kline> funimation, cr, etc exist because the JP producers dont even release to the western market
[04:25:20] <kline> you cant steal profit away from something that theyd never sell to you in the first place
[04:25:38] <edk> artists tend to get upset when corpos put pressure on them to corrupt their vision
[04:25:49] <edk> there's no such force limiting cr
[04:26:09] <manicennui> kline: Funimation is how they release...
[04:26:16] <manicennui> They are playing licensing fees.
[04:26:30] <kline> if anything, fansubbing has been the grassroots growing and developing the western anime market and will realistically, long term, be a net-positive generator for the anime industry
[04:26:32] <dimadima> wow vodka cooling
[04:27:42] <quanticle> Yeah, Russian engineering sure was a thing, huh?
[04:27:43] <manicennui> s/playing/paying/
[04:28:05] <manicennui> kline: For that to be true, people would have to be using piracy just to sample things and then eventually pay for them.
[04:28:05] <kline> tl;dr: home subbing is making the anime industry
[04:28:20] <manicennui> I think a small number of people do that.
[04:28:37] <quanticle> Didn't Crunchyroll get started by basically hosting a bunch of fansubs?
[04:28:51] <kline> manicennui, fansubbing is almost exclusively the demand signal for what is wanted in the western market and without it, nothing would ever get released
[04:28:57] <kline> quanticle, yeah
[04:29:18] <manicennui> kline: Nonsense.
[04:29:21] <quanticle> Like they used the demand for pirated content to prove to Japanese studios that they should be allowed to distribute officially licensed releases. It was really scummy
[04:29:43] <manicennui> Many shows are simulcast now.
[04:29:49] <manicennui> And have been for years.
[04:29:52] <kline> quanticle, im not sure that it is. everyone is beginning to win
[04:30:42] <kline> operating outside the rules is fine if the situation is simply that no one will consider writing the rules until youre operating
[04:30:57] <quanticle> I mean, it was scummy of Crunchyroll to use the fansubbed content to get a bunch of fat distribution contracts without acknowledging or giving back in any way.
[04:31:21] <kline> oh, sure
[04:31:23] <quanticle> Well, I don't know about that; it seems way too close to what e.g. Uber and AirBNB do
[04:31:34] <quanticle> "Laws don't matter lol, we'll grow so fast your lawsuits can't stop us"
[04:31:54] <kline> well, uber and airbnb i dont think are the same
[04:32:03] <kline> the taxi and hotel markets did already exist
[04:32:21] <edk> they're also massive corporations, fansubbing teams are just a bunch of dedicated nerds
[04:32:30] <kline> in the UK, the whole regulation issue was non-existant since we already have the concept of private hire, so it was just an app front for that
[04:32:48] <edk> not exactly, there are still licensing rules they tried to ignore
[04:33:00] <kline> whereas fansubbing was until recently literally the only way to get japanese content in the west
[04:33:04] <quanticle> Fair enough
[04:33:35] <kline> edk, yeah, but thats just them being shitty - its not that they were operating greenfield, just they wanted to fiddle at the borders and pretend it didnt apply to them
[04:33:39] <edk> yeah
[04:33:47] <kline> private hire is a thing, they were just a frontend for private hire
[04:33:50] <edk> yes
[04:34:54] <kline> in the west, there is no general anime industry, just a small handful of commercially subbed, hand picked series and made-for-western market
[04:35:09] <kline> 99% of shows do not get western releases outside of fansubs
[04:35:18] <kline> (im sure someone has the actual number)
[04:36:17] <edk> nfi, but i also think the quality of the releases that do exist is crap, and that's something your average western anime fan has no way to vote with their wallet on
[04:36:18] <quanticle> Even today, there are a bunch of shows that don't get Western releases.
[04:38:50] <kline> the idea that fansubbing is piracy is true only in the most academic sense
[04:39:37] <kline> in practice it has no effect on bottom lines not because its niche but because it has no commercial release that it is stealing revenue from, its that simple
[04:41:11] <kline> you could argue that this means that once its on cr/netflix/etc you need to stop using fansubs but i still would say that that would be a net loss for animators because we should ensure that while the market is western market is still 1% of the size of the domestic market that we send consistent signals for quality content, not low-cost-high-margins dreck
[04:41:35] <kline> this will benefit animators, producers, distributors, and viewers in the long run

[20:46:56] <river> i mean mouses are hard to draw with already but still

[20:51:07] <gwozniak> Do you do a lot of drawing?
[20:54:13] <river> no but it's a good test of how precise you can control the thing
[20:57:33] <gwozniak> sure, I guess
[20:58:00] <gwozniak> Never been an issue for me. Drawing with a mouse or trackball is terrible in either case, in my experience
[20:58:31] <gwozniak> Moving it to point to something or drag or whatever is basically the same. Ergonomically, I find the trackball better over time
[20:59:52] <river> i was interested in this mouse that has a trackball on the side
[20:59:54] <gwozniak> I have found tracking a straight line is easier with a trackpad than a mouse or trackball

[21:06:34] <gwozniak> I'll reply tactfully
[21:10:59] <gwozniak> river: I suppose if you are travelling with the mouse a lot, the trackball could be a hindrance
[21:11:43] <gwozniak> gerikson: I do not wish to count the number of pointing devices I have used over the years
[21:12:06] <gwozniak> For a while I used a Wacom tablet
[21:12:25] <river> i mean like moving it around on the mousepad
[21:12:30] <river> the extra weight of the trackball
[21:12:50] <gwozniak> Sounds like you want a mouse, then
[21:13:12] <river> yeah i can't figure out which one to get
[21:13:21] <gwozniak> I used a vertical mouse for a while. It was pretty good, but my arm didn't care for it after a couple of years
[21:15:20] <river> yeah I have a vertical mouse but i don't really like it, I don't use it
[21:15:36] <river> I can't decide if it actually makes sense ergonomically
[21:16:14] <gwozniak> It did for me (for a while)
[21:16:44] <gwozniak> Using a typical mouse for me these days is a bad idea, except for short periods
[21:19:58] <river> hmm
[21:20:07] <river> maybe i really should just give a trackball a go

[21:45:54] <indigo> Trackballs are nice, I like the Kensington expert mouse
[21:46:10] <indigo> I went back to a regular mouse though
[21:46:38] <indigo> Can’t play shooter games well with a trackball
[21:48:01] <Brekkjern> It's hilarious when everyone in the group tries though :P
[21:48:25] <Brekkjern> We used to play CS on mousepad only back in school. Everyone sucked and it lead to hilarious games
[21:49:05] <indigo> I’d be down for that
[21:49:19] <gwozniak> indigo: yes. Important point is that I don't play games
[21:49:22] <indigo> ”fire in the hole!”
[21:50:52] <gwozniak> archive.org is pretty slow right now (for me, at least)

[23:26:28] <manicennui> I'm watching this video about an introvert (his description) in Japan, and he went to an unmanned convenient store.
[23:26:44] <manicennui> To pay, he walked toward the register and it seemed to know which items he had already.
[23:27:28] <manicennui> https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/02/business/jr-east-open-100-unmanned-convenience-stores-next-four-years/
[23:27:29] <buttsbot> JR East to open 100 unmanned convenience stores in next four years | The Japan Times
[23:27:31] <manicennui> Wonder whether it was that.
[23:27:40] <manicennui> "Utilizing a system developed by Touch To Go Co., a joint-venture company of JR East, stores have around 50 cameras installed inside to identify every item customers pick up."
[23:28:11] <ngoldbaum> anazon fresh stores do the same thing
[23:28:33] <manicennui> Yeah, I was just curious whether this was more widespread in Japan. Looks like it is just taking off.
[23:29:08] <manicennui> When searching for that I noticed this: https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/Japan-s-Daiei-to-open-unmanned-supermarket-with-Chinese-startup

[23:32:47] <dimadima> got to love being tracked in every possible way just to get food
[23:33:30] <manicennui> I don't have a problem with it.
[23:33:53] <manicennui> Most people willingly join the card programs at grocery stores.
[23:34:14] <dimadima> I do, but it's cool that people do not
[23:34:19] <river> i just got a nectar card
[23:34:27] <river> hopefully ill get some free money
[23:34:30] <manicennui> The fewer humans I have to deal with the better generally.
[23:34:56] <dimadima> Hah you have to deal with them, when they're homeless and on the street
[23:35:09] <gwozniak> I'm generally happy with chatting with those at the checkout
[23:35:11] <dimadima> like when they set up an encampment outside your house
[23:35:18] <gwozniak> Not that I chat a lot, but I appreciate it
[23:35:46] <manicennui> gwozniak: I only seem to enjoy that at smaller stores where I actually get the same people over and over again.
[23:36:02] <manicennui> Several of the people at my favorite coffee shop know me.
[23:36:35] <gwozniak> I generally only shop at smaller places, but it's really my wife who does most of the shopping for our place
[23:36:48] <manicennui> There is a smaller "European grocer" nearby. I might know some of their employees if I shopped there more.
[23:37:23] <manicennui> I think some of the cashiers at the supermercado in my old neighborhood probably knew me.
[23:37:36] <manicennui> But we didn't really socialize.
[23:38:49] <manicennui> I just don't really enjoy small talk, and shared interests are unlikely to come up in a retail setting.
[23:39:30] <gwozniak> Just saying "hello" is nice.  It can be fun to actually answer the question, "how are you?"
[23:39:45] <manicennui> As if I would tell them the truth!
[23:40:44] <manicennui> Looks like my favorite coffee shop is accepting travel mugs again.
[23:40:58] <manicennui> I should really try to get up early enough to walk down there and buy breakfast in the morning.
