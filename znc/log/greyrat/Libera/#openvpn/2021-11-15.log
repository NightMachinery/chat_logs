[21:15:55] <xx> I receive these two warnings on client when connecting:
[21:16:08] <xx> WARNING: 'link-mtu' is used inconsistently, local='link-mtu 1553', remote='link-mtu 1549'
[21:16:12] <xx> WARNING: 'auth' is used inconsistently, local='auth SHA256', remote='auth [null-digest]'
[21:16:30] <xx> this is the server and client config files: https://0x0.st/-R21.txt
[21:16:48] <xx> client is OpenVPN 2.5.1
[21:17:00] <xx> server is OpenVPN 2.4.11
[21:17:19] <xx> both are using openssl
[21:17:47] <xx> I suspect the 'auth' warning is the source of the 'link-mtu' warning
[21:17:57] <xx> but I don't know what causes the auth warning in the first place
[21:18:16] <xx> both the client and server config have 'auth SHA256' in the config files
[21:18:48] <xx> any help fixing this would be appreciated
[21:19:24] <xx> the connection does work, but I'd like to deal with the warnings too

[23:13:33] <xx> I've seen some posts online about this, but nobody was willing to go the full way of specifying their openvpn versions used (both server & client) and the config files
[23:13:46] <xx> so I at least provide the versions and config files, so that the mystery can be solved
[23:17:26] <ordex> xx: what cipher is being used?
[23:22:30] <xx> AES-128-GCM for data TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 for control
[23:22:41] <xx> I'm aware that GCM doesn't use the auth keyword
[23:22:47] <xx> but tls-crypt and still does
[23:22:57] <xx> *but tls-crypt and tls-auth still does
[23:31:08] <ordex> xx: tls-crypt uses AES-CTR/SHA256 regardless of your options
[23:31:13] <ordex> tls-auth...let me check
[23:31:57] <ordex> yeah, tls-auth uses what you have specified in 'auth'
[23:32:18] <xx> is it documented somewhere that I can drop 'auth' if I'm using tls-crypt and not tls-auth?
[23:32:53] <ordex> it's the documentation for --tls-auth that says it is used for tls-auth
[23:32:58] <ordex> sorry
[23:33:06] <ordex> it's the documentation for --auth that says it is used for --tls-auth
[23:33:24] <xx> and the documentation is definitely up to date? tls-auth came a few years before tls-crypt
[23:33:24] <ordex> it does not mention tls-crypt - this should be enough :)
[23:33:36] <ordex> xx: the manpage definitely is
[23:34:16] <xx> heh, where even is the official manpage for 2.5 anyway? https://openvpn.net/community-resources/reference-manual-for-openvpn-2-4/ is the latest published one on the website
[23:34:33] <ordex> I checked 'man openvpn' :D
[23:34:36] <ordex> but it should be somewhere
[23:35:05] <ordex> xx: https://openvpn.net/community-resources/reference-manual-for-openvpn-2-4/
[23:35:06] <ordex> ops
[23:35:11] <ordex> xx: https://build.openvpn.net/man/openvpn-2.5/openvpn.8.html
[23:35:44] <xx> thanks, so I'll make a note to remove 'auth SHA256' if AES-GCM (or chacha) and tls-crypt but not tls-auth is used
[23:36:26] <ordex> you can still keep it there,but it does nothing, othe than creating noise. 2.5.x should just ignore it and indeed sends "null"
[23:36:31] <ordex> *other
[23:37:00] <xx> I really don't want to be keeping superflous/deprecated options on config files, it makes a mess
[23:37:40] <ordex> agreed
[23:38:13] <ordex> I am also for not using auth at all
[23:40:02] <xx> I'll be testing this to see if it removes that link-mtu warning as well (I suspect it will). Other than that, I hope my config files are ok.
[23:40:58] <ordex> btw why ssticking to those versions and not going to latest stable?
[23:41:31] <xx> linux packaging and openwrt packaging, all of them too slow to keep up to date with upstream
[23:41:56] <xx> and I'm not gonna try building crypto-related stuff myself
