[05:36:30] <Henry151> I'm working on the css and design on my site https://romp.network/ and I am having a little hiccup, maybe you can help me solve
[05:36:56] <Henry151> if you see the little image under the "storage" column, when you hover on it it gets bigger, you'll notice though that the background image changes size too
[05:37:10] <Henry151> I want the background image/the rest of the site to stay still, and only the little image to get bigger
[05:37:13] <Henry151> any tips?

[06:44:55] <FunkyBob> Henry151: wow, that's annoying... when I hovre over the Storage image, because it shifts it's no longer hovered... causing rapid flickering
[06:45:28] <FunkyBob> did you know there are many more useful block elements other than DIV?
[06:45:39] <FunkyBob> like main, section, article... header, footer...
[06:46:17] <FunkyBob> as well as aside and nav
[06:47:49] <Henry151> FunkyBob: I'm a bit new at this I suppose. Just starting to get the hang of making the page look how I want it to.
[06:48:31] <Henry151> for the longest time I would just copy someone else's page and swap things out for my own, but now i'm starting to be able to sorta make it look how i want on my own.. a lot to learn still though
[06:48:43] <FunkyBob> i find it's a lot easier to keep track of the purpose of stuff when it has meaningful elemnts
[06:49:08] <FunkyBob> I find this image really useful - http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png
[06:49:29] <FunkyBob> as well as their quick reference forelements - http://html5doctor.com/
[06:50:07] <Henry151> wow that is excellent
[06:50:16] <Henry151> i will refer to this
[06:50:22] <FunkyBob> for your menu... instead of float [with all its hazards], you might find flex a better choice
[06:53:37] <Henry151> well.. just switch the word "float" to the word "flex" (without further modification) makes it pop all three menus into one column on the left, instead of having them side by side in a row (when on a full-size screen) and in a single column (when on a mobile screen)... can you point me toward how to make flex do the desired behavior?
[06:54:20] * Henry151 goes looking for the documentation of flex
[06:54:33] <FunkyBob> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[06:55:50] <Henry151> excellent
[06:56:35] <Henry151> ... any advice about how to make my thumbnail enlarge when hovered on, without making the background image shift in size?
[06:58:51] <FunkyBob> am mangling at the moment to test it out
[06:58:53] <FunkyBob> I've done that before
[07:00:04] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[07:00:18] <FunkyBob> root of the problem is you're changing the height of the page by changing the height of the content
[07:01:15] <Henry151> hmm yeah.. I was noticing as well that in different size browsers (or when zooming in and out on the page) the position of the text and elements relative to the background image changes, which I would prefer it to not, because i want to keep the dark text on the lighter parts of the image
[07:01:31] <FunkyBob> https://codepen.io/FunkyBob/pen/eYGrezq?editors=1100
[07:01:44] <Henry151> i wish there were a way to "lock" the background image to the text/elements so that it stays the same relative to them
[07:02:55] <Henry151> hmm
[07:03:11] <Henry151> now if i could understand how you did that, but in a way that i could implement it without mangling the rest of the page..
[07:03:39] <FunkyBob> 1. position: relative; the _parent_ of the image, so it is the reference point for absolute positioned chiuldren
[07:03:45] <FunkyBob> 2. position: absolute; the thumbnail
[07:03:56] <Henry151> because, i do have the page looking how i want it to look, more or less. and with my limited experience, it's very hard and time-consuming for me to get it back to how i want it, once it's looking differently
[07:04:02] <FunkyBob> this has the downside of removing the image fron the content flow, so it no longer effects sizing

[07:04:25] *** Joins: eson123 (~whatever@118.69.128.37)
[07:04:50] <eson123> anyone knows how can i use some color such as $teal-200 or such according to this https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/color/, usually bootstrap set color through classes such as warning, light, dark, ...
[07:05:17] <Henry151> well maybe i need to look at a different way to do this -- is there any way to "lock" the background image size to the text size, so that zooming in and out or changing display size doesn't alter the exact position of the text on the background image itself?
[07:05:27] <FunkyBob> eson123: that looks like LESS or SASS (iirc Bootstrap uses less)
[07:05:44] <FunkyBob> Henry151: you're mixing up different issues...
[07:06:08] <Henry151> because having the text position relative to the mountains change when i zoom in and out or when i have a different display size, is already making it impossible for me to control how the page looks
[07:06:33] <Henry151> if the text and the background image were locked to one another, i could get the text positioned just right relative to the mountains and all, and know that it would look that way on any device
[07:06:45] <FunkyBob> Henry151: try  background-size: contain; on your body
[07:07:04] <Henry151> then separately, i would like to have the little thumbnails that when you hover on them they get bigger; but they also shouldn't alter the relative position of text vs background image
[07:07:09] <Henry151> FunkyBob: ok i'll give that a shot
[07:07:14] <FunkyBob> Henry151: the background image is covering the <body> element... the <body> element is changing size because its contents is changing size...
[07:09:18] <eson123> FunkyBob: i guess i have to do this the hard way
[07:09:28] <eson123> i haven't tried either less or sass :P
[07:09:35] <matsaman> eson123: CSS does variables on its own now
[07:09:47] <matsaman> bootstrap is shite
[07:09:59] <FunkyBob> was about to mention vars...
[07:10:12] <FunkyBob> but if you're already using BS, keep using BS I guess...
[07:10:16] <eson123> yea if you mean by adding the color code #20cetc like that then i am doing it
[07:10:19] <FunkyBob> though I thought they, too, used css vars now
[07:10:27] <FunkyBob> eson123: no, we mean css vars

[07:10:46] <Rockwood> matsaman, FunkyBob happy new year
[07:12:19] <Henry151> hmm this is no good.. https://i.imgur.com/1Ttbmns.png https://i.imgur.com/Y4peVut.png zooming in and out makes it look all mangled and awful. I guess locking the text to the background image won't have the desired result at all. I need the background image to stay the size of the window, so that when i zoom in and out my background image stays exactly the same size, and only the text grows and shrinks. is
[07:12:25] <Henry151> that possible?
[07:12:52] <FunkyBob> Henry151: I really don't know what you mean by "locking the text to the background image"
[07:12:57] <Henry151> perhaps instead of locking the background image to the "body" element, is there some way to lock it to a 'higher-up' element?
[07:13:08] <FunkyBob> so you want the image to always fill the viewport, and never change size?
[07:13:17] <FunkyBob> the background image is ALREADY "locked" to the body
[07:13:20] <Henry151> yes, i'd like to try that
[07:13:21] <FunkyBob> because you put it on  the body
[07:13:26] <Henry151> i see
[07:13:33] <Henry151> maybe i should put it on a different element
[07:13:36] <FunkyBob> the part I mentioned that you seem to keep ignoring
[07:13:41] <FunkyBob> is the body element is changing size
[07:13:45] <FunkyBob> because its content is changing size
[07:13:49] <Henry151> ok, i see
[07:13:51] <Henry151> i understand now
[07:13:54] <FunkyBob> really?

[07:14:11] <Henry151> i will try to put the background on a

[07:14:18] <FunkyBob> if you set the body and html elements to width: 100vw; height: 100vh;
[07:14:23] <FunkyBob> you might start from a happier place
[07:14:33] <FunkyBob> the only 'higher up' element than body is html
[07:14:38] <FunkyBob> or do you mean lower... a descendant?
[07:15:02] <FunkyBob> I don't think changing what the background is attached to is the problem
[07:15:30] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[07:16:47] <Henry151> well i would love it if the background did not change size at all, when i zoom in and out with the ctrl+ or ctrl- buttons on my web browser
[07:17:07] <eson123> FunkyBob: ok so according to that, i assume var($teal-200); should do the job ?
[07:17:12] <FunkyBob> that's an entirely separate issue to the one caused by your resizing image
[07:17:17] <FunkyBob> eson123: no
[07:17:24] <FunkyBob> because $whatever is NOT in your CSS
[07:17:39] <FunkyBob> it's coming from the LESS that bootstrap is using to generate the CSS
[07:18:22] <Henry151> FunkyBob: well, the resizing image is changing the size of my "body", but it's not changing the size of my display or my screen; i'm hoping to achieve "the background image stays the same size on the screen, no matter the size of the other elements"
[07:18:23] <eson123> i guess i have to do the color code then, idk less
[07:18:45] <FunkyBob> Henry151: yes, so I started trying to help  you achieve that
[07:19:16] <Henry151> set body and html elements to width 100vw and height 100vh?
[07:19:23] <FunkyBob> yes
[07:19:44] <FunkyBob> that locks them both to being the same size as t he viewport of the browser
[07:20:00] <FunkyBob> you'll likely also want overflow: auto; on body
[07:21:53] <matsaman> Rockwood: & to you
[07:23:00] <Henry151> FunkyBob: this is awesome
[07:23:01] <Henry151> thank you
[07:24:12] <Henry151> only thing i would like to change now, is that there is some white border area showing on either side of the background image, i would love it if we could make it "120% of the size of the screen" so that it's sure to spill out over the outside edges; but setting width and height each to 120vh and 120vw didn't seem to have the result i was imagining
[07:24:35] <FunkyBob> Henry151: probably need to remove the default padding from html
[07:24:48] <FunkyBob> you come up with the most hacky solutions by default
[07:25:08] <FunkyBob> "should I look at what's causing it? or just hack my way arund the problem messily?"
[07:25:35] <Henry151> sorry
[07:25:42] <Henry151> i do try to learn the right way
[07:25:54] <Henry151> you have taught me a lot in the last hour alone :)
[07:26:38] <Henry151> so, removing the default padding from html; my imagined way to do that was setting "padding: 0px" in my html css.. but that seemed to have no change
[07:28:43] <FunkyBob> do you know how to use the Inspector in your web browser?
[07:29:04] <Henry151> there may be no way to get the result i'm looking for; but i can describe it: https://i.imgur.com/hIemz8p.png https://i.imgur.com/CqFg9d9.png in the first image there is space on the left and right of the bg image, on the second i've changed the size of my browser window, and now there's white space above and below my bg image. I'd love it if there were never any white space above, below, or to either side
[07:29:10] <Henry151> of my bg image
[07:29:11] <Henry151> FunkyBob: yes i use it constantly
[07:29:27] <FunkyBob> Henry151: then use it to investigate if it's margin or padding that's on your HTML and BODY by default
[07:30:59] <Henry151> it doesn't look like it is..
[07:31:56] <FunkyBob> there's an 8px margin on BODY
[07:31:59] <Henry151> but this brings my desired result clearer, i think: https://i.imgur.com/jvWo7MB.png see how now, there's a really big white gap on either side of the bg image? i want some kind of constraint telling it that it can never shrink narrower than the width of the viewport or display area, even if to do so the top and bottom have to poke over outside of the screen
[07:32:04] <Henry151> oh
[07:32:46] <Henry151> i don't see that in my inspector
[07:33:26] <Henry151> likewise, i want it to never allow white space above or below the bg image, even if to do so it has to have a lot of the sides cut off, does that make sense?
[07:33:35] <FunkyBob> it shows on chome as the Computed colour box...
[07:33:41] <FunkyBob> also as part of the user-agent style sheet
[07:33:50] <FunkyBob> did you look at the other options for background-size?
[07:33:53] <FunkyBob> perhaps you want cover instead?
[07:34:06] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size
[07:34:47] <Henry151> hmm i'll see how that performs
[07:34:50] <Henry151> thank you for the link
[07:35:11] <Henry151> https://i.imgur.com/Sk11Okk.png also see, i don't see any 8px thing on body in my inspector, as far as i can tell
[07:35:33] <FunkyBob> get in the habit of consulting MDN :)
[07:35:45] <FunkyBob> switch to "Computed"
[07:35:59] <Henry151> wooohooo

[09:03:55] <programmar> god this is frustrating, how can i fill out the lower part of a range slider if it is opened on chrome ? https://jsfiddle.net/tusL47yd/1/, that code works as expected on Firefox but on Chrome it kinda ignores the lower fill tho
[09:04:01] <programmar> pls help
[09:16:13] <oksushi> programmar: it looks like that has annoyed a lot of people before you https://github.com/samuelcarreira/webkit-input-range-fill-lower
[09:16:41] <theskillwithin> isn't there a new css property that does this?  its form-something
[09:17:27] <theskillwithin> https://jsfiddle.net/tusL47yd/1/
[09:17:31] <theskillwithin> accent-color?
[09:18:13] <oksushi> more annoyed developers https://dev.to/munkacsimark/styled-range-input-a-way-out-of-range-input-nightmare-jeo
[09:18:54] <oksushi> and more https://codepen.io/duplich/pen/qjYQEZ
[09:18:57] <oksushi> sheesh
[09:19:54] <programmar> my goodness, what keywords did u put into google to find that @.@
[09:20:02] <programmar> i have been struggling so long trying to find the right post
[09:20:18] <oksushi> “css ms-fill-lower”
[09:20:59] <theskillwithin> programmar https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/zL6pc74d/
[09:21:38] <theskillwithin> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/accent-color/
[09:23:28] <theskillwithin> watch out it doesn't work on safari yet, but it will soon
[09:24:01] <programmar> wait what, "accent-color : purple;"
[09:24:03] <programmar> and it's blue
[09:24:15] <theskillwithin> huh? looks purple to me
[09:24:27] <programmar> damn am i colorblind @.@
[09:24:44] <programmar> oh no, i just changed it to yellow, still blue
[09:24:45] <theskillwithin> programmar lets try red https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/5yezhkqj/1/
[09:24:59] <programmar> yep, still blue here
[09:25:02] <programmar> on Chrome
[09:25:14] <theskillwithin> so am I
[09:25:21] <theskillwithin> are you on the latest version of chrome?
[09:25:41] <theskillwithin> https://caniuse.com/?search=accent-color
[09:25:58] <programmar> Version 90.0
[09:26:14] <theskillwithin> ah you need to update chrome
[09:26:40] <programmar> oh so that attribute doesn't support older chrome :( ?
[09:26:51] <programmar> sed
[09:27:12] <theskillwithin> ya its relatively new
[09:27:39] <programmar> only if there is a way to do this on all version
[09:27:43] <programmar> except those which are too old
[09:29:35] <theskillwithin> I still use it, but everything im working on right now won't be launched for another 6 months as well
[09:29:52] <theskillwithin> it will probably be a lot safer to use in 6 months
[09:30:12] <theskillwithin> unless you want it to work in IE,  but screw IE
[09:31:03] <programmar> nya i never want to develop a site for IE, but some slightly older version of chrome is still nice
[09:31:10] <programmar> not everyone updates their browser

[10:44:43] <Henry151> heh because i didn't realize that was an option
[10:44:49] * Henry151 blushes
[10:44:55] * Henry151 goes to fix it
[10:45:36] <FunkyBob> you didn't remove the margin from body
[10:45:47] <FunkyBob> and for some reason you're still using float for the horizontal nav stuff...
[10:45:57] <FunkyBob> so you have to use silly "float containment" strategies
[10:46:49] <FunkyBob> but hey, it's a process :)
[10:46:52] <FunkyBob> and it's looking a lot better
[10:48:12] <FunkyBob> also t here's footer instead of <div class="footer"
[10:48:30] <FunkyBob> next we can work on learning to use selectors so you don't have to keep repeating styles :)
[10:49:17] <FunkyBob> (am also wondering why you keep adding width: 100%;  ... block elements do that naturally)
[10:49:54] <Henry151> ah, i didn't know..
[10:50:26] <Henry151> i'm using float because i played with flex containers for about twenty minutes and i couldn't make it look like it does
[10:50:49] <FunkyBob> I added "display: flex;" to .description and it just worked.
[10:51:13] <theskillwithin> don't forget to fix that horizontal scroll
[10:51:38] <FunkyBob> flexbox can take some time to get your head into
[10:51:39] <FunkyBob> `flex

[10:51:56] <theskillwithin> flexbox froggy ftw
[10:51:59] <FunkyBob> theskillwithin: we were tryiing to resolve the issue with the background image not covering the viewport
[10:52:19] <FunkyBob> am thinking perhaps making only html that big, making it have the background, and make it sticky?
[10:52:57] <Henry151> i switched to flex
[10:53:00] <FunkyBob> add background-attachment: fixed;
[10:53:35] <FunkyBob> also... check the validator errors... you can't have <p> inside <Hx> ...
