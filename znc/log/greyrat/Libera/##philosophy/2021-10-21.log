[00:01:10] <mannequin> columbus was clever
[00:01:16] <thunder> yeah. this was a common naval combat technique, because a person in the crow's nest could observe an enemy ship while their own vessel is hidden over the horizon
[00:02:21] <thunder> on a smaller scale you could do this in your living room with a single lamp and a strip of brown paper. place various chopsticks at regular intervals and measure the length between the position of the chopstick and the end of the shadows. now do the same thing for an arch or sphere whose circumpherence is twice the length of the paper used on the flat surface. note the differences, which using triangulation can be used to compute the angle of the
[00:02:21] <thunder> light source. that will give an object demonstration of the principal used in ancient times to compute the circumpherence of the earth.
[00:03:46] <thunder> as far as I understand it anyway

[00:09:04] <mannequin> well
[00:09:33] <mannequin> it seems that humanity instead of being more and more enlightened does otherwise
[00:09:51] <mannequin> someone said once to me
[00:10:05] <thunder> the liberal arts are dead
[00:10:05] <mannequin> if not the we would become omnipotent
[00:10:29] <thunder> they've been replaced with unimpeachable ideologies

[00:11:10] <mannequin> our mortality is our fate
[00:11:22] <mannequin> this is what keeps us down
[00:11:50] <mannequin> someone said to me once
[00:11:51] <wasd> are you talking, since the dawn of time or is there some age when man was peak elightened and we've been going down hill since then.
[00:11:57] <mannequin> human destination is to work
[00:12:27] <mannequin> well, knowledge became a privilege
[00:12:54] <mannequin> you know, like european feudalism
[00:13:11] <thunder> it always was. public school (other than monasticism) wasn't even available to most people prior to the 20th century.
[00:13:43] <mannequin> well, antique was brutal but greeks and romans were more chill when it comes to knowledge access
[00:13:53] <mannequin> on the other hand, they didn't know too much
[00:14:13] <wasd> compared to now?  public libraries?  internet?
[00:14:34] <mannequin> yeah man, we got the great internet and dogmas are spreading instantly
[00:14:38] <wasd> surely you can't argue the average roman had better access to knowledge?
[00:14:45] <mannequin> it didn't help as expected
[00:15:04] <mannequin> well, it's about of system of beliefs, not actuall knowledge
[00:15:07] <mannequin> because
[00:15:12] <mannequin> that's a part of human nature
[00:15:20] <mannequin> we are like lost in fog
[00:15:50] <wasd> like depression though, maybe we're just mulling something up
[00:15:59] <wasd> like an AI singularity.
[00:16:11] <mannequin> back in my days everyone wanted internet, now, the internet has us
[00:16:43] <thunder> the government and corparate establishment have largely lost people's confidence, and people tend to take an all or nothing approach in response, rejecting all knowledge received from any associated source in the belief that it's propaganda rather than enlightened truth
[00:16:59] <mannequin> this is what it is
[00:17:15] <thunder> the attempt to control the dissemination of credible information has backfired
[00:17:19] <mannequin> but i can understand it's rather for safety of the species
[00:18:02] <wasd> The internet has given access to scientific papers and you can even email questions to the authors and get responses.
[00:18:20] <mannequin> yeah
[00:18:25] <mannequin> and many people don't like that
[00:18:42] <wasd> That some choose to use that resolve to find out what betty had for tea or whether russia will deploy armies of nanobots into their soup doesn't really seem that important.
[00:18:46] <mannequin> i grew up in a different reality
[00:18:48] <thunder> to a degree. there's a huge array of prerequisite knowledge to even understand a lot of that stuff, much less ask a question credible enough to receive a polite response

[00:24:17] <mannequin> revolution eats the children of it's own
[00:24:33] <mannequin> well i was a gear on the technoboom in the society
[00:24:38] <mannequin> now it became a monster
[00:25:19] <wasd> all changes take time to adjust.  We're probably just in the "WTF?!" phase of information overload and distortion.
[00:25:29] <mannequin> most of the people were super enthusiastic about this
[00:25:32] <wasd> I personally wouldn't assume it will always be like that.
[00:25:52] <mannequin> i have no clue what will happen in 30 years
[00:26:11] <wasd> it's easy to see the negative of now too though (in fact, that perspective is almost pushed too)...
[00:26:18] <mannequin> but last few years show significant technological progress, it's accelerating
[00:26:55] <mannequin> internet became like water and oxygen
[00:28:30] <wasd> or Heroin
[00:28:46] <mannequin> you can look at it like that
[00:29:15] <mannequin> but water and oxygen can be dangerous as well
[00:29:26] <wasd> positive social media dopamine response, I was thinking.
[00:30:51] <mannequin> it's same story, different times
[00:31:01] <mannequin> most of us are just pawn in this game
[00:31:18] <mannequin> and it is played since humanity emerged
[00:31:42] <mannequin> same game, different methods

[00:32:23] <mannequin> hard to think about it
[00:32:32] <thunder> on the bright side, once consumer space flight becomes ubiquitous, the flat earth debate will die out
[00:33:14] <mannequin> freedom is a mirage
[00:33:26] <thunder> freedom only exists in the context of limitations
[00:33:43] <wasd> don't forget some contrast though.  "the internet" isn't just social media junkies.  scientists can share data across the globe, analysing the results of all sorts of things they never used to have access to.
[00:34:02] <thunder> why the internet was invented in the first place
[00:34:11] <wasd> news about what is happening no longer takes days or weeks to get from one place to another.
[00:34:15] <thunder> apart from the military application
[00:34:42] <wasd> How quickly are relief funds etc now organised?
[00:35:20] <thunder> just as quickly to be consumed by the charity's employees, or some other group of pirates
[00:35:38] <wasd> knowledge share and activity coordination basically, but the ingenious ways people apply that is fascinating.

[08:00:29] <causative> it's difficult for me to understand how "people" and "speech by people" seems to occupy a special ontological place in some people's discourse, as if inanimate objects were all placed in some other, less relevant category
[08:00:54] <causative> but maybe it is a result of a difference in how social reasoning emerges in their brains compared to in mine
[08:02:49] <causative> I say, "things are real," they say, "but who says that? that's what really matters, what people say." I wonder if this is really a *philosophical* difference, or actually a *biological* difference in our brains
[08:06:41] <thunder> fwiw, dr. caroline leaf (a neuroscientist) is where I got that number. 63 days is the minimum to see effects of neuroplasticity using modern high def brain scans
[08:07:05] <thunder> specifically when forming and/or reforming habits
[08:08:22] <causative> did you get it from Dr. Caroline Leaf, or did you get it from an article citing Dr. Caroline Leaf?
[08:08:53] <thunder> I saw a lecture by her where she stated and elaborated on this.
[08:09:07] <causative> Dr. Caroline Leaf's "63 days" claim is three "21 day" steps, which she is selling as "21 day detox" on her website here: https://21daybraindetox.com/
[08:09:07] <ro-bot-o> [url] Dr. Leaf 21 Day Brain Detox Program | 21daybraindetox.com
[08:09:17] <causative> in other words this is clickbait, not science
[08:09:45] <thunder> she's selling a product, but I've yet to see any claim that it's not based on sound science, of which she herself is a pioneer in the field
[08:10:00] <thunder> ie. neuroplasticity research
[08:11:28] <causative> it is obvious to anyone that the specific "21 day" figure (or tripled to "63 days") is an advertising jingle, not sound science
[08:11:34] <thunder> personally, if I came across something with such widespread practical implications, and few/no people were thus far aware, I'd probably sell some kind of howto myself just to get it out there and not pauper myself with the effort
[08:11:45] <causative> sound science would give a range like "15-30 days"
[08:12:11] <causative> in biology the real figure is never going to be exact

[08:13:06] <thunder> tbd as in I'm not gonna preconceive a conclusion until I've investigated the publications she's made in a scientific capacity
[08:14:05] <thunder> as I said, she also made it clear it's just a minimum period, and that for some people, particularly with deep seated habits (such as those founded in trauma), it may take longer
[08:14:31] <thunder> minimum as in the minimum time before conclusive results appear amongs her test subjects
[08:14:35] <causative> Dr. Leaf's publications are popular self-help books
[08:14:45] <causative> looking on google scholar I don't see any published papers by her
[08:14:46] <thunder> did you check google scholar or equiv?
[08:15:10] <thunder> okay. well I'll do likewise at some point and decide accordingly
[08:15:47] <causative> the "21 days" figure should be placed in the same category as "learn C++ in 21 days"
[08:16:39] <causative> i.e. marketing nonsense that sounds good and sells books
[08:16:39] <thunder> sure. tbh, I don't much care if the number is completely accurate so long as the overall method is effective. getting my panties in a bunch over minutia isn't in my nature
[08:17:08] <causative> well, it's a warning sign that you are consuming marketing copy, not science
[08:17:25] <causative> it makes the rest of it suspect
[08:18:30] <thunder> true. though as someone who's already gone through a process with all the same features she's outlined, I can say it works and it's a good concise description of the process involved
[08:19:33] <thunder> so if I want to communicate with other people about howto, I can refer to her with gnostic confidence in what I'm sharing. the 63 days thing isn't critical imo, though I do understand why you'd take it as a red flag

[10:24:26] <causative> let's say you are looking at a picture of a maze, and you are trying to solve it by drawing an imaginary line through the maze. This is an example of thinking using images that I do, and since you said you also think using images, I'
[10:24:34] <causative> I'll suppose you also solve mazes like that.
[10:24:45] <causative> how is the imaginary line structured like a human language?
[10:27:34] <causative> it's structured by the fact it must not cross itself or the walls of the maze, and it must stretch from the entrance of the maze to the goal

[10:33:31] <Player001> in its being-for-us we have a line in our imaginary-symbolic reality which completes a maze.
[10:34:02] <causative> so answer the question: the line is a signifier, yes or no?
[10:34:07] <Player001> of course if we restrict ourselves to the imaginary (the realm of images) the line is not even a line. We just have a field of vision in which it appears
[10:34:41] <Player001> and any further attempt to clarify and abstract will make use of signifiers and language

[10:36:46] <causative> are you saying the line itself is a signifier, or are you only saying the words "the line" are a signifier?
[10:37:01] <Player001> in its raw being, in the field of vision about which nothing could be said as abstraction has not been made, it is not a signifier I suppose
[10:37:24] <Player001> causative: one of Lacan's points is the fact of the barred signifer
[10:37:46] <Player001> there is a separation between signifier and signified
[10:38:01] <Player001> such that unmediated access to the signified is impossible
[10:38:39] <causative> so, at last, I have pried out a simple fact about your position: you do *not* consider mental images such as lines to be signifiers. You only apply this designation to words in human language.
[10:38:40] *** Joins: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan)
[10:38:51] <causative> But you *do* accept that you use these mental images to think with.

[10:46:29] <Player001> because in think using the image of the line, abstraction has already been made, which is a symbolic process.
[10:47:32] <causative> when I say "the image of the line" I am never speaking of the *words* "the image of the line," nor am I speaking of an *abstraction* of the image of the line

[10:49:08] <Player001> we have a line and a maze through which it passes
[10:49:31] <causative> yes, and *separately* from that, we have the words or concepts "the line" and "the maze"
[10:49:53] <causative> I am not much concerned with the latter, I am referring only to the former: the actual maze, and the actual imagined line
[10:50:23] <Player001> using no abstraction, the most that could be "thought" about this is "it exists"
[10:50:50] <Player001> but of course we can't even do the second without bringing in signification
[10:51:03] <Player001> so do we think using this pure image?
[10:51:24] <causative> well, when I solve a maze, what I think about the line is nonverbal, but if expressed in words it would be something like:  "Can the line go over here? no, dead end. How about here? ok, I can get through here. Ah, and around this bend. There, solved it."
[10:51:25] <Player001> we see it and noting else

[10:51:38] <causative> I just trace the line mentally, as if I was tracing it with a finger or pencil
[10:52:31] <Player001> so you know the rules of mazes
[10:52:51] <Player001> you're using the unary trait of the maze
[10:53:05] <causative> just like I don't use words when catching a baseball
[10:53:17] <causative> it's a visual and kinematic process, not a verbal one
[10:53:38] <causative> things take form not because I have named them, but because I have formed the image
[10:53:43] <causative> do you do that?

[11:00:38] <Player001> the use of literal spoken word really isn't important because by language isn't meant one specific human language but signification as such
[11:00:58] <Player001> specifically a totalizing system of such signification
[11:01:57] <Player001> now, catching the baseball
[11:02:13] <causative> if the use of literal spoken word isn't important (to the question of whether signifiers are being used), why do you say that the mental image of the line is not a signifier?

[11:06:28] <Player001> yeah that's not a mental image
[11:06:51] <causative> ...
[11:07:07] <causative> the line is by definition a mental image

[11:07:36] <causative> it's a mental image

[11:08:03] <causative> would any of your prior statements change in light of that?
[11:09:06] <Player001> oh then we're positing a line with the defining property (unary trait) of "it solves the maze"?
[11:10:59] <causative> we're in the process of drawing the line, mentally, to solve the maze
[11:11:06] <causative> during this process the line has not yet solved the maze
[11:11:19] <causative> we're trying to draw it to make that happen, but it has not yet happened, and the line is changing over time
[11:12:02] <Player001> ok yes that is a signifier
[11:12:42] <Player001> because the line has properties
[11:12:58] <Player001> of may or may not solve the maze
[11:13:12] <causative> it has a lot more properties than that
[11:13:34] <Player001> that just links it to more signifiers
[11:13:42] <causative> it has a property of "went here" or "did not go here" for every individual point in the maze, and we may identify millions of such points
[11:13:59] <causative> the line is a continuous object

[11:15:40] <causative> you should have been doing that all along, I don't understand how we got this far on the question of whether the line is a signifier and you're finally saying yes
[11:16:01] <Player001> you like to ask meandering questions
[11:16:13] <causative> I asked direct yes or no questions, you gave meandering answers that you're now changing
[11:16:18] <Player001> and often not exactly to most relevant

[11:16:42] <Player001> I'm not changing the answer
[11:16:52] <Player001> yes
[11:17:09] <thunder> wouldn't it be more specific to say the line "is used as" a signifier?
[11:17:11] <causative> so we do not think just with words, or just with human language - you agree that there is more to thought than human language
[11:17:35] <thunder> I don't think a line has any inherent meaning of it's own beyond that we choose to associate to it
[11:17:46] <Player001> thunder: yeah basically
[11:18:05] <Player001> causative: symbolic order = language
[11:19:03] <causative> this word "symbol" to me suggests a discrete set, such as a letter in the alphabet or a word in the English language - something that may be chosen *arbitrarily*, meaning that the discrete set has no structure within itself
[11:19:25] <Player001> ...
[11:19:30] <causative> we could replace the A in our alphabet with a λ , and vice versa, and nothing would be different
[11:19:39] <thunder> I've been toying with the idea that a thought is essentially a correspondence made between two experiences. it also seems to act something like a vessel for any associated emotional contents.
[11:19:44] <causative> that's what "symbol" means to me - it doesn't matter how things are labeled, the labeling is discrete and arbitrary
[11:19:46] <thunder> two or more*
[11:20:14] <Player001> causative: let's move on
[11:20:29] <thunder> experiences also encompassing other mental products which themselves may also be thoughts
[11:20:33] <causative> included in this meaning is the fact that continuous values, like a real number, or sets of values that have structure, like an element of an algebraic group, are *not* symbols
[11:20:54] <causative> the line, according to this definition of "symbol," is not a symbol; it has spatial structure, not arbitrary structure, and it is not part of a discrete set.

[11:22:04] <thunder> I would even go so far to say that because a symbol/signifier is an correspondence of two or more experiences, a thought is therefore a subclass of symbol/signifier
[11:22:37] <causative> so... do you agree with everything I said? this is a yes or no question
[11:22:52] <causative> don't go talking about Lacan without first saying yes or no
[11:24:13] <causative> ("everything I said" is meant in regard to the definition of symbols just now)
[11:24:57] <Player001> if that's how you feel about the word symbol, I'll keep that in mind
[11:25:05] <causative> thanks for the clear yes or no answer
[11:25:30] <thunder> cajs
[11:25:37] <thunder> oops
[11:26:01] <Player001> you're the one who appears to be stonewalling right now
[11:26:18] <causative> I asked you a simple yes or no question about how you are using the word "symbol" and whether it agrees with my usage
[11:26:32] <causative> either say yes, or say no and explain the difference between your usage and my usage
[11:26:42] <thunder> causative: I'd argue that the line can be part of a discrete set if you think of an example like euclidian geometric propositions. it represents one dimension on a plane
[11:26:48] <Player001> I said symbolic order
[11:27:10] <Player001> basically associated with meaning as such
[11:27:36] <thunder> you can easily add or remove dimensions. the 0 dimension would be the dot, of which the line is an infinite series
[11:27:52] <thunder> or point rather to use the correct term
[11:28:42] <thunder> the point being that the meaning, grouping or ascribed characteristics of the line are contextual (ie. formed by it's associations)
[11:29:48] <causative> Player001, or if you think anything about my stated usage of "symbol" was unclear, you can say that and ask me to clarify
[11:30:11] <Player001> causative: I really don't care about your usage of the word symbol
[11:30:17] <Player001> because it is irrelevant
[11:30:23] <causative> You used the word "symbol"
[11:30:29] <causative> before I did
[11:30:30] <Player001> symbolic order
[11:31:12] <causative> does "symbolic order" not refer to a structure whose elements are symbols?
[11:32:10] <causative> if it does, then what you say to me is meaningless unless we first clarify the notion of "symbol"
[11:32:24] <thunder> the other element is that order can be regarded as arbitrary. math procedes with this by starting with the smallest unit and adding it to it's sum repeatedly. but this isn't a universal understanding among cultures. there are plenty of "anumeric" cultures which don't have words for numeracy. if they did they might just as well decide that two precedes one (for instance because each individual human and most animals are formed from two parents).
[11:34:09] <Player001> causative: the symbolic order is the order of signification, of language, structure, meaning, subjectivity
[11:34:27] <causative> that's very vague
[11:34:48] <thunder> in fact if you consider it, even the idea of "one" necessitates there being something which it is not, which in the direct experience of most people would be "many"
[11:34:59] <causative> it's not specific about what kind of order you're talking about
[11:35:09] <causative> it's not clear what fits into the order and what doesn't
[11:35:18] <Player001> the symbolic order is also known as the symbolic register
[11:35:29] <thunder> you can look at this historically by reviewing the history of the concept of zero/zephir
[11:36:19] <Player001> as opposed to the imaginary (concerned with images and the home of the conscious ego) and the Real
[11:36:26] <causative> Player001, I am used to the distinction between symbolic and connectionist methods in artificial intelligence. Symbolic methods use ideas developed from formal logic, involving discrete sets of objects and function symbols.
[11:37:08] <causative> connectionist methods involve networks, where it is difficult to tell what is signified by what, because everything is just a non-human-readable number
[11:37:23] <causative> except, usually, for the inputs and outputs
[11:38:20] <causative> when you talk about a "symbolic order" I am thinking of something similar to formal logic, with discrete symbols such as we would write in formal logic
[11:38:34] <thunder> not sure how relevant this is to the current discussion, but godel's incompletenesses and semantic primes both come to mind
[11:38:49] <causative> and *not* something continuous and numeric
[11:40:54] <Player001> the symbolic order is where signifiers live
[11:41:10] <Player001> they are also structured in a big chain
[11:41:23] <causative> when you say a "chain" this indicates to me that it has discrete links
[11:41:27] <causative> not something continuous
[11:41:34] <Player001> every signifier connects to other signifiers
[11:41:57] <Player001> I guess it is discrete but not in a formal logic way
[11:42:35] <causative> because the line through the maze is not discrete
[11:42:45] <causative> there are a continuous infinity of ways that line might be drawn
[11:43:15] <Player001> OK
[11:43:48] <causative> but you say it is a signifier, despite the fact it is not discrete?
[11:46:03] <Player001> I say IT is a signifier?
[11:46:09] <Player001> sure

[11:48:24] <Player001> as in, emphasizing that the line is referred to in the singular
[11:48:33] <Player001> so we appear to have made abstraction
[11:48:48] <causative> again not talking about any abstraction of the line
[11:48:53] <causative> only the line itself
[11:49:32] <causative> look, if a computer were drawing this line, it would have an image file - perhaps a bitmap - where it fills in each pixel of the line one by one
[11:49:53] <causative> and it might have another file, or another object in memory, which stores metadata about the image: what it is, what it connects to
[11:50:00] <causative> I'm *not* talking about the metadata
[11:50:03] <causative> I'm talking about the bitmap
[11:50:20] <causative> they're different things
[11:50:36] <causative> when we name the line, the name adds metadata, and the metadata is not the line
[11:50:46] <causative> the line is the bitmap file, not the metadata file
[11:51:10] <thunder> makes sense
[11:52:59] <causative> so I worry that when you say that the line is a signifier, but then you justify it by saying "we appear to have made abstraction," what you *mean* is, that by naming it we have made a metadata file, and that the metadata file is a signifier
[11:53:05] <causative> but I'm not asking about the metadata file
[11:53:09] <thunder> I was out having a smoke and thinking about this, and it occurred to me that every experience is inherently comprised of associations between all the different form of sensory data which are perceived (consciously and otherwise) in the here and now of that experience, even if no other imaginal association is produced in response
[11:53:55] <causative> the metadata file is *also* a signifier, that's not the question, the question is about the bitmap file
[11:53:59] <thunder> that in turn creates a corresponding association in memory, such that the next time we have an analogous experience, that memory will surface consciously or subconsciously
[11:54:18] <causative> and the question is not about any additional metadata files ("abstractions") that may have been created by asking the question
[11:54:47] <Player001> the abstractions are already in the bitmap file
[11:55:07] <causative> no, the bitmap file just has an array of pixel colors
[11:55:40] <causative> the bitmap file acquires meaning through its relationship with other files and objects on the computer, not through anything recorded directly within itself
[11:56:03] <causative> or rather, what is recorded directly within itself is only the raw data, which acquires meaning by its relationship with other things
[11:56:31] <causative> the metadata - such as naming it - is something separate
[11:56:41] <Player001> you literally just described a signifier
[11:56:46] <causative> something separate, which does *stand in relation* to the bitmap file, but *is not* the bitmap file
[11:56:59] <Player001> <causative> the bitmap file acquires meaning through its relationship with other files and objects on the computer, not through anything recorded directly within itself
[11:56:59] <Player001> <causative> or rather, what is recorded directly within itself is only the raw data, which acquires meaning by its relationship with other things
[11:57:33] <causative> fine, and to you, this means that the bitmap file itself - *not* any metadata or language about the bitmap file - is a signifier
[11:57:36] <thunder> causative: with respect to non-word forms of thought/association, how about a musical composition? is that not symbolic of the composer's experience and/or emotion? is it unworthy of or impenitrable to description via that medium?
[11:57:55] <Player001> the signifier acquires meaning through its relationship with other signifiers in the unconscious, not through a direct relation to the signified
[11:57:59] <causative> certainly thunder
[11:58:16] <thunder> another example would be a visual artwork
[11:58:22] <causative> yes that too
[11:58:57] <Player001> what is recorded in the signifier itself are just sounds or an image, which acquires meaning through a relationship to other signifiers
[11:59:12] <thunder> I think like you said it varies from person to person. for me a significant part of my meditation practices had to do with eliminating "word-mind" so that I could bask in the raw experience untainted by description
[11:59:31] <causative> yes, we often think without words
[11:59:40] <causative> without human language
[11:59:42] <causative> animals do too
[12:00:09] <causative> when we do so, we are still thinking with "signifiers" in the sense Player001 has described
[12:00:10] <thunder> part of my motive for doing so was to get a true sense of the territory prior to trying to create a map for myself to recall it's structures
[12:00:15] <causative> but not with words or language
[12:00:53] <thunder> I was wondering about emotions and if they are like thoughts a form of symbolic representation
[12:02:01] <thunder> I know there's quite a lot of feedback between thought and emotion, but it's still challenging to decide what if if the demarcation point is between them in this respect
[12:02:06] <causative> I don't like to call everything "symbolic"
[12:02:23] <causative> to me the word "signifier" is much more acceptable than "symbol" when talking about fuzzy, continuous things such as pictures or emotions
[12:03:23] *** Quits: nooitaf (~nooitaf@95.85.60.197) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[12:03:30] <thunder> sure. I can accept that. I'm in the habit of using symbol because I don't have a great deal of academic jargon floating in my head and it generally gets the idea across to ley people such as myself
[12:03:34] <Player001> thunder: well the emotion itself might be thought to be part of the bodily Real
[12:03:52] <causative> you start talking about these things with the word "symbol," next thing you know you're back in 1973 writing symbolic code for your Lisp machine that will achieve general intelligence within 5 years, as your marketing literature proudly attests
[12:04:04] <thunder> Player001: are you speaking about the mind/body duality question?
[12:04:18] <Player001> not exactly
[12:04:26] <thunder> causative: lel!
[12:06:05] <Player001> just that emotions in their raw being are not part of the imaginary-symbolic order
[12:06:41] <Player001> but of course when you start to think about the emotion itself it becomes a signifier
[12:06:52] <Player001> like "this anger I just felt"
[12:07:16] <Player001> "this anger I just felt was caused by..."
[12:07:47] <thunder> hypothetically, if we always have some emotion or more occurring (consciously or otherwise) in the present, then every time we form a thought/association there is a corresponding emotion(s) that comes along for the ride. so each time we recall any thought or event or whatever, a kind of venn diagram builds up with the constructive/destructive interference creating an aggregate where one or another emotion(s) predominate in association to that
[12:07:47] <thunder> thought. this would normally occur instinctively and relatively unconsciously
[12:08:34] <Player001> I mean that's kind of already how the symbolic order functions
[12:08:54] <Player001> every signifier has associations with other signifiers
[12:10:18] <thunder> it seems to me a bit of a chicken or egg question. like if you experience sadness and think of your friend/relative who passed away, versus you think of your friend/relative and feel sad.
[12:11:38] <thunder> I know from my own experience that it's possible to enter into memories and transform/recontextualize the emotional experience deliberately
[12:12:11] *** Quits: parachute_ (sid433686@helmsley.irccloud.com) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:13:33] <thunder> there are also some physiological queues which are empirically shown to trigger emotions, such as smiling in order to become happy, even in a clinical setting where the person is not told specifically to smile, but simply to speak the long vowel E sound which causes the face to go into an approximately similar state of muscle contraction
[12:14:00] <thunder> it works with some other emotions too, such as U making people sad

[12:19:00] <causative> I think it's better to feel the way you need to feel
[12:19:19] <causative> if you're upset, it's better to accept and acknowledge that you are upset, and watch yourself being upset
[12:19:31] <causative> don't repress it and pretend to be happy
[12:19:31] <thunder> true, but there are occasions where it can become oppressive, particularly if you get into the habit of a negative emotional/thought pattern

[12:20:23] <causative> like Kim Jong Un releasing a press release about how great everything is
[12:20:47] <causative> that's not the way to fix your country, Kim - you need to accept the problems and be aware of them and respond to them
[12:20:49] <thunder> causative: you can be aware of the problem without it overtaking the priorities in the moment. everything has it's time and place.
[12:21:18] <thunder> I'm not advocating spiritual bypassing. just handing out a rudder for the boat
[12:21:42] <causative> I think smiling makes people happy if they basically feel happy and just need an excuse to let it out
[12:22:17] <causative> if people aren't happy, I think it's harmful to try to force the outward appearance
[12:22:32] <thunder> it's sort of analogous to method acting. if you set your mind to it, you can pilot your psyche like a vessel. it's liberating if it's not taken to an unhealthy extreme
[12:23:08] <causative> in my experience, you can't build walls in your mind and force it to go the way you want - if you try, all you will manage is to fool yourself for a while
[12:23:22] <causative> you didn't change what was under the surface, you just painted over it
[12:23:30] <causative> and meanwhile it's still festering
[12:24:10] <causative> you have to look inward and accept that you feel the way you feel. And often this will make you feel better, sometimes even immediately.
[12:24:33] <thunder> an analogy I came up with many years ago was that the psyche is like a forest. if you walk a certain pathway over and over it will become vary easy to traverse, even if the path itself is rocky and treacherous. but all the other paths which are neglected will become overgrown and no longer accessible directions to travel. we have a choice which paths to emphasize and which to let disappear into the jungle

[12:25:33] <thunder> causative: shadow work ;)
[12:25:51] <causative> if you walk the path of "pretending to be happy when you're unhappy," that is what you will find easy to traverse in the future:  pretending to be happy when you're unhappy
[12:27:28] <causative> if you want to clear the "happy" path you have to practice mindfulness and accept that the bad stuff is there. Don't indulge it but do accept it. And maybe by accepting it you'll feel better or something that might help will occur to you.
[12:28:23] <causative> the mindful way of dealing with anger, for example, is to just notice "oh, yes I am feeling anger right now" and sort of watch yourself being angry
[12:28:29] <causative> the act of watching calms you down
[12:28:36] <thunder> I've seen this plenty of times in the newage community, where people are so focused on "love and light" that they become consumed by their shadow and lead around on a little passive aggressive dance by a puppeteer they won't let themselves be aware of. the term for it is usually "spiritual bypassing" and it's antidote is "shadow work". but if you're in the middle of a job interview and find yourself getting annoyed, while it's perhaps a red flag to
[12:28:37] <thunder> be aware of, you don't have to pause the conversation and enter into meditation there and then
[12:29:08] <causative> well, if you're in a social situation where you have to appear happy, you have to appear happy
[12:29:14] <causative> but it's not something that heals you
[12:29:24] <causative> it's something you just gotta do
[12:29:48] <thunder> on the other hand if you get used to feeling happy and learn to genuinely invoke that emotion at will, it can make for a very pleasant experience
[12:30:12] <causative> if you're feeling bad, and have to pretend to be happy, you won't actually feel happy
[12:30:14] <causative> you'll feel worse
[12:30:56] <causative> it's like trying to run on a sprained ankle
[12:31:18] <thunder> it depends. I agree with you in principal, but my own experience and practical use of this process lends me a degree of tempering in my opinion
[12:31:32] <thunder> it has it's place
[12:31:35] <thunder> and it's a good one

[21:32:33] <causative> two concepts are relevant here:  the "upstream" meaning of a proposition, and the "downstream" meaning of the proposition
[21:33:02] <causative> the upstream meaning of the proposition is how the proposition may be derived - what other propositions may be combined to produce the proposition as a consequence
