[00:38:11] <Kaiod> <alMalsamo> "jxself: Sounds sheisty, surprisi..." <- Although the question is not directed at me, I believe this violates the Youtube Terms of Service, in fact, the youtube API itself does not provide support for this.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/61301c979dd5b413a82be0e1aa874353652c6c7d)
[00:38:43] <Kaiod> > <@alMalsamo:libera.chat> jxself: Sounds sheisty, surprising this is legal.  How do Invidious and Piped legally scrape youtube videos, I am pretty sure this violates YouTube's ToS?... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/2f01ba5e1a7b9991f9c96d6c68ef93684c6536da)
[00:44:34] <alMalsamo> Kaiod: Did you right this message? I am confused what libera.ems.host is, why didn't you just write response in channel?  Anyway how does youTube profit from this "piracy"?  They don't get to track users and build information profiles on them and it ruins their ability to see ads
[00:44:50] <alMalsamo> I guess this also applies to youtube-dl and yt-dlp, not just Invidious and Piped
[00:45:48] <alMalsamo> I heard music industry trying to shut down youtube-dl repos, but why doesn't Google go after these projects when they clearly violate the ToS and it ruins Google's primary business model: track users and build info profiles on them, and show them ads?

[12:08:07] <epony> microkernels are weird they can have different licensing in different parts of the kernel even, and sometimes clash licenses which explains why theyr performance is weaker (especially for SMP and SMT processing)
[12:08:29] <epony> ^ that's a joke
[12:09:06] *** zhenruyan1 is now known as zhenruyan
[12:09:45] <epony> but the perfomance and overhead in context switching and parallelism degradation of efficiency is well known, the primary reason these are not used on servers and parallelised workload
[12:10:21] <epony> but that's not really bothering someone who insist on the license more than the technical details
[12:10:57] <epony> for the other part of humanity except that person, you know it already, technical details are crucial

[20:19:45] <isf> if you see that issue i recommend dont accept the service kompowiec
[20:19:45] <Andrew> You'll like it cuz it!s in Java
[20:19:59] <isf> becouse never is good the drm even if is for promotion a no-drm service
[20:20:45] <Andrew> "service"
[20:21:12] <isf> or service or a product
[20:21:27] <isf> always drm is bad becouse drm always is propietary software
[20:22:03] <Kaiod> kompowiec2: I think this applies anyway, the condemnation of DRM. However, I recommend you contact info@defectivebydesign.org, possibly they should be more clear about this.
[20:23:21] <kompowiec2> well apart from the fact that they just have a great radio, many years ago they let it run in free software with m3u but it was obviously abused by pirates so they turned it off.
[20:24:16] <kompowiec2> Kaiod, other more extremal example it skype and their SIP support. If you paid, you can run skype on linphone
[20:25:09] <isf> if the provider have DRM
[20:25:19] <Kaiod> kompowiec2: I think this is similar to Spotify. If you pay the premium, you can use free clients, but it's still DRM anyway.
[20:25:21] <kompowiec2> i consider it extreme as most users will not pay for this service and will be stuck in a walled garden.
[20:25:25] <isf> the best we can do is in terms of freedom repecting is say no to him
[20:25:38] <isf> and search a provider who respect your freedom with his service without DRM
[20:25:40] <kompowiec2> Kaiod, spotify is DRM even if you paid, so i think that it's bad example
[20:26:00] <isf> Spotify is completly DRM
[20:26:04] <kompowiec2> yeah
[20:26:32] <isf> literal you pay a service with DRM becouse you dont have freedom on it
[20:26:38] <isf> that is the reason DRM exists 
[20:26:39] <labrador> just use a media player
[20:26:48] <labrador> and a local library
[20:26:49] <isf> for put users in a state of unless
[20:27:10] <isf> i recommend buy a Music Player with your music on it without DR;
[20:27:11] <isf> DRM
[20:27:16] <isf> beter than phone
[20:27:19] <isf> better*
[20:27:28] <GNUHacker> ffmpeg guyz
[20:27:28] <Kaiod> kompowiec2: The fact is that it limits the use of free clients to payment only, so the free client can be used, only if you pay. In any case, I think it is DRM in the same way as ISF said, and in fact, we should deny it. However, you can contact the campaign, and see better with them, maybe they explain the situation in another way.

[21:59:37] <labrador> Maybe someone from fsf could answer that

[22:00:15] <labrador> nope not realistic

[22:17:06] <labrador> Oh fuck yeah ncmpcpp can be made to do that. I just need to define %l - Lyrics for the tag and then make a column display %l in a colour

[22:18:09] <jillejr> that cmd name though
[22:18:24] <jillejr> doesn't really flow off the tongue
[22:19:00] <labrador> lmao yeah. Its a pretty bad name. But thats the reason I like cli things. They're usually very extensible
[22:20:18] <jillejr> saw a movie review of a movie set in the future, like 2100, and the reviewer exclaimed "so unrealistic, it's the future, do you want me to believe we would still be using terminals?!?"
