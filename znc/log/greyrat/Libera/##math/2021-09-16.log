[00:23:04] <droid3> But my curiosity is how do you factor polynomials in several variables???
[00:23:41] <droid3> Is there away to test if a polynomial in several variables is reducible and if so to reduce it ???

[00:24:42] <droid3> I can do grobner base to find ideal membership or if two ideals are members of one another using a reduce grobner bases. Or even solve systems of polynomial equations in several variables
[00:26:11] <droid3> But is there away to factor polynomials in several variables or determine irreducibility ???? Grobner bases seem to only be a way to write polynomials in linear combinations of a generating set nicely.
[00:26:56] <droid3> I was thinking grobner base idea could some how be used to check irreducibility or factor polynomial in several variables yet its not really working well for me.
[00:28:23] <droid3> So maybe grobner bases isnt the right idea. But if not how does one normally factor polynomials in several variables into irreducibles ? When its one variable over a field that not bad and even over a finite field we still got Berlekamp's algorithm Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm.

[00:29:38] <droid3> But several variables is where i am still pondering.... As i can treat it as F[x,y,z] = F[x,y][x] so factor taking only x as a variable.
[00:30:06] <droid3> Yet that sort of a problem as F[x,y] isnt a field its more an integer domain.

[00:30:34] <cuppajoeman> But this is a set and I only only want one value from it
[00:30:49] <riv> can you describe what the function does?
[00:31:12] <cuppajoeman> Yeah, it gives any element x st f(x) is the minimum value on X
[00:31:20] *** Joins: DrMax_ (~DrMax@132.215.96.37)
[00:31:24] <riv> droid3, I think factoring F[x,y][z] is less general than factoring F[x,y,z]
[00:31:26] <droid3> which is fine if it was say Q and Z but being able to solve F(x,y) function field to its ring of integers F[x,y] isnt so obvious like Q to Z proven by einstein and gauss.
[00:31:43] <riv> cuppajoeman, is X infinite?
[00:31:56] <cuppajoeman> I'm not sure
[00:31:58] <cuppajoeman> I suppose it could be
[00:32:01] <riv> it's tricky if X is infinite
[00:32:13] <riv> because there may not be an attainable minimum value
[00:32:32] <cuppajoeman> Oh, like if you have the function -x right?
[00:32:34] <riv> like 1/x on R_{>0} for example, it gets close to 0
[00:32:43] <droid3> riv the problem is sure if we where in the case single variables factoring Z[x] or Q[x] is pretty much the same method /same thing proven by gauss and einstein.
[00:33:03] <cuppajoeman> Ok, lets assume for the moment that X is finite,
[00:33:55] <droid3> As you probably already know. But in several variables if i have F[x,y,z] and treat it as polynomials in a single variable x over a integer domain F[y,z] then how does one factor?

[00:48:51] <droid3> But the next obvious generalization and final generalization would be to polynomials in several variables which is what i am currently stuck on.
[00:50:15] <droid3> finding roots for single variable and roots for several variable polynomials are pretty easy with newton and jacobins and other root finding algorithms. Plus Galois proved its impossible for nice closed forms in general.
[00:51:17] <droid3> So root finding is not what i am after i am only after the factorization problem into irreducibles and apparently i havent found anybody that knows algorithms or a theory on how to do it in general for several variable polynomials

[00:52:53] <droid3> This is the most general problem as anything weaker the UFD for the base field would imply the problem is sort of meaning less because irreducibles wont equal primes and when F is a ring not even an integer domain primes arent even irreducibles.

[00:58:51] <droid3> your thinking about using a field extension that is algebraically closed then reducing down to the base field you orginally started with but how where you think of it just by knowing the roots
[01:01:13] <droid3> mwt I am a bit confused on this root reduction thing you where thinking on. With one variable over an algebraically closed field like C C[x] we got all the irreducible polynomials as (x-r1)(x-r2)(x-r3)....(x-rn) so its all linear terms your building up.
[01:01:55] <droid3> and because complex roots are in conjugate pairs implies over the reals R[x] we have all irreducible factors being of degree 1 or 2
[01:02:13] <mwt> In multiple variables, I think they are not necessarily linear
[01:03:00] <droid3> right because there not nessarily a PID domain just a UFD.
[01:03:09] <mwt> you can have entire planes of roots
[01:04:17] <droid3> right so roots dont help you like they do if your factoring R[x] you can take it to C[x] get all the roots which give you all the linear factors which are the irreducibles over C
[01:04:33] <mwt> if you knew that every point s.t. x^2y-y^2=3 was a root, then you could probably reduce by (x^2y-y^2-3) right?
[01:04:53] <droid3> then build it up to R[x] polynomials because complex conjugates and the fact your only going to have deg 1 , or deg 2 things.
[01:05:30] <droid3> but when going to several variables even over an algebraically closed field i dont see any relation that helps for knowing the roots to being able to factor

[02:57:40] *** Joins: captain_awesome (~captain_a@69.168.163.234)

[02:59:13] <buster> Vornicus, three great circles generically divide the sphere into 8 triangles. these are equal in pairs: the area of ABC is equal to the area of A'B'C', where A' is antipodal to A, and so on. also, each lune (or digon, or if you really insist, diangle) is composed of two of the triangles.
[02:59:14] <droid3> its interesting because everybody can understand the problem and factorization is very useful to know so has many application as well as just a beautiful pure math theory.
[03:00:57] <droid3> not to mention grobner bases even with the f4 f5 algorithms are still exponential runtime so i imagine if grobner bases method would help the factoring several variable polynomial into irreducibles is going to have algorithm runtime of exponential
[03:00:59] <buster> Vornicus, can you take it from there?
[03:02:10] <droid3> At any extent it just be nice to know how to distingish irreducibles from reducible polynomials as a starting point. Because without this you cannt really take it to the next step and solve factorization.
[03:03:06] <droid3> I suppose irreducible ideals are the ideas that are maximal so one could add an element and check to see if the reduce grobner base is one the whole ring. But that even has problematic parts to it.
[03:03:55] <Vornicus> Think that might help.  I then have - okay I have four things A M N P; I need A, and I know that A+M+N+P = 2pi, A+M = 2a, A+N = 2b, A+P = 2c... yeah this gets me there
[03:04:38] <buster> yep that should do it
[03:05:37] <Vornicus> thank you
[03:05:45] <droid3> like you need a way to be able to pick a element outside your <irreducible ideal>. If you could always determine this then you could always compute <irreducible ideal , chosen element> and if you get a reduce grobner bases of <1> = whole ring you know it must be irreducible because the ideal generated by that irreducible element had to be a maximal idea

[03:15:25] <droid3> ok all stop brainstorming now but am very interested to here anybody that can give a general algorithm or solve this problem.
[03:16:22] <droid3> I think the base field being a finite field would be slightly easier the over  Q, Z,C infinite domains/field.

[05:18:30] <aac> what are propositions in math?
[05:18:49] <aac> what makes equations important then ?? they can just be right or wrong
[05:19:10] <aac> oh ok after proved what happens ? what is approving one equation
[05:19:22] *** Quits: mefistofeles (~mefistofe@user/mefistofeles) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:19:56] <PlanckWalk> I don't know what you mean by "approved" there
[05:20:06] <PlanckWalk> Or "after proved"
[05:20:10] <PlanckWalk> Err, "approving"
[05:20:47] <aac> an equation that can be used later to do other stuff, i mean , what the equations are for anyway ?? i guess they are aproved by truth value
[05:21:03] <aac> if they are aproved, one can build other stuff from it
[05:21:05] <aac> if its wrong no
[05:21:25] <aac> my question is, how do you determinate if a equation is wrong?
[05:21:27] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[05:22:22] <aac> for example, we have values x=0 y=6 that make the equation wrong. Is the equation still correct?
[05:23:15] <aac> for example , in terms of propositions, For all x's , if it fails, i can replace bby some X's
[05:23:25] <PlanckWalk> If you have a context in which x and y are already defined with those values, then *in that context* the equation is false.
[05:23:54] <aac> and that breaks the equation right? because if the equation is correct, there are some wrong values (and if they're wrong, A!=B)
[05:24:16] *** Quits: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:24:19] <PlanckWalk> An equation with free variables is not the sort of things that has "correctness".
[05:25:17] <aac> Ok. the question is : if i prove that the equation has values that make left_hand_Side != right_hand_side ...they it pertains to all those quation that were discarded
[05:25:28] <PlanckWalk> Just like "she is tall" is not "correct" or "incorrect" unless you specify who "she" is.
[05:25:33] <aac> so that "breaks" the equation
[05:25:59] <PlanckWalk> (Ignoring the vagueness of "tall")
[05:26:08] <aac> :)
[05:27:03] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[05:28:47] <PlanckWalk> If you can prove that there are assignments of values that make the equation false, then you have proved "there exists x, y such that not(x = y + 1)"
[05:29:13] <aac> in that case , what happens?
[05:29:22] <PlanckWalk> You haven't proved "not(x = y + 1)", because that's not a proposition.
[05:30:08] <PlanckWalk> aac: What happens next is up to you.  Was that a useful thing for you to prove?
[05:30:52] <aac> 0=6+1 , this indicate that left side != to right side
[05:31:05] <aac> so isnt it a not?
[05:31:07] <captain_awesome> Seriously.... How do you go from "notation" and "symbols"... to the true meaning in your head?
[05:31:20] <captain_awesome> The hardest part for me is understanding the meaning behind the symbols.
[05:31:36] <PlanckWalk> aac: You still seem to be assuming that "x = y+1" means "for all x and y, x = y+1".  It doesn't.
[05:31:45] <aac> oh i see
[05:31:57] <aac> i think i got it thanks
[05:31:58] <aac> :)
[05:32:19] <aac> generally that's not the case right? when people make equations, what are they thiking?
[05:32:26] <aac> like for all x's or?
[05:32:36] <PlanckWalk> In *some* contexts, those quantifiers are assumed - but those contexts are usually pretty obvious.
[05:33:25] <PlanckWalk> Like  sin(theta)^2 + cos(theta)^2 = 1  usually means "for all real theta"
[05:33:50] <aac> so..its bad. You have to know which contexts to use
[05:33:55] <PlanckWalk> Or  (x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2
[05:34:14] <PlanckWalk> Context is very important yes
[05:34:30] <PlanckWalk> (Not just in math.  In everything.)
[05:34:33] <aac> so..isnt there a "default" assumpiton? how can we know the context?
[05:34:42] <aac> could be zillion of people working...
[05:34:50] <aac> what context would they choopse?
[05:35:20] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[05:36:14] <aac> so in x=y+1, we are interessed in both wrong and correct values
[05:37:07] <aac> how does proof by contradiction works?

[05:37:44] <aac> so ..there is wrong :)

[05:38:32] <aac> so..could you use the P , with correct and wrong answer?
[05:38:40] <aac> since they are both valid
[05:38:49] <PlanckWalk> P is a proposition
[05:38:59] <aac> can it be true or false
[05:39:08] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:39:08] <aac> assuming the context you mentioned
[05:39:23] <PlanckWalk> Note that in most contexts, an equation is not a proposition
[05:39:40] <aac> so if a equation can be right or wrong, can't we use it in propositions'
[05:40:13] <PlanckWalk> A bare equation isn't a proposition
[05:40:51] <aac> ok..so it can considered true or false?

[09:13:57] <qergle> but ultimately you want the purple
[09:14:09] <biberao> well
[09:14:21] <biberao> finding the yellow
[09:14:28] <qergle> you know the yellow already
[09:14:29] <biberao> the same technique as before
[09:14:44] <biberao> so the yellow and blue and done the purple
[09:14:46] <biberao> let me do it
[09:14:53] <qergle> you don't need to find the yellow, you know it
[09:15:28] <biberao> yes
[09:15:32] <biberao> its the same as the red
[09:15:40] <qergle> no
[09:15:50] <biberao> no
[09:15:51] <biberao> ?
[09:16:24] <qergle> when you found the red, what was the other leg of that triangle?
[09:16:38] <qergle> green=hyp, red=leg, other leg was how long?
[09:17:10] <biberao> its also 5?
[09:17:13] <qergle> sure
[09:17:23] <biberao> how do you prove that?
[09:17:31] <qergle> red and yellow are perpendicular
[09:17:40] <biberao> ok
[09:17:40] <qergle> and red bisects AD
[09:18:01] <biberao> i see

[09:39:36] <droid3> ya guys you probably heard of Schwartz-Zippel lemma and algorithm for probabilisticly testing if a polynomial expression F[x,y,...z] = 0 aka the zero polynomial. Its easy when where in single variable polynomial but several variable polynomials is the difficult part.
[09:40:18] <droid3> I know i know i am really overkilling this polynomial factorization talk but its an important missing piece to fully completion of all polynomial issues.
[09:42:10] *** Quits: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[09:42:39] <droid3> Anyway if we can find a method to determine p(x,y,...z) = 0 polynomial then we also have a way to determine when two polynomials in several variables are identical because p[x,y,...z] = g[x,y,...z]  => p[x,y,...z] - g[x,y,...z] = 0 and where back to the Schwartz-Zippel problem.

[13:30:47] <Hazey_Dream> Other than brute force, what would be a way to determine the divisors or multiplier, for a given number, where neither the divisor/multiplier, nor the result of applying them are repeating decimals?
[13:32:10] <Hazey_Dream> For example: For 24, multiplying it by roughly 1.666667 can result in the whole number 40, but that multiplier is a repeating decimal, so should be excluded from the list.

The "chance" that can happen are simply (number of shared items) / (number of items in either subset combined), because the further order doesn't matter; then to count permutations you just multiply that by n!, the total number of permutations

[21:22:28] <pikapika> Oh right. Much simpler proof, yes.
[21:22:37] <Simplar> Let n be the sum of the first two and sum of the last two digits. n is a natural number that can take values from 1 to 18. If a_n the quantity of two-digit numbers with sum of their digits equal to n, then the number we look for can be expressed as (a_1)^2+(a_2)^2+...+(a_18)^2. The two-digit number with sum of its digits equal to n consists of digits (a) and (n-a), where 0<=a<=9 and 0<=(n-a)<=9. Thus, 0<=a<=9 and (n-9)<=a<=n. If n<=9, then there exists
[21:22:37] <Simplar> (n+1) matching numbers: the value range of a will be [0;n]. If 9<n<=18, we have (19-n) matching numbers: the value range of a becomes [n-9;9].

[21:28:46] <pikapika> and 18 if it was upto 9999
[21:28:48] <int-e> Simplar: So two pretty different problems then. Fine.
[21:29:04] <qergle> 00:1,01:2,...,09:10, 10:2,...19:9, 20:3,...29:8, ...
[21:29:13] <Simplar> int-e: they are similar. to me, the latter problem is the key to solving the first problem, if i can trim.
[21:29:29] <int-e> Not fundamentally different... but going up to 4444 makes things quie a bit more tedious because the symmetry between the first and second pair is lost.
[21:29:47] <int-e> So... it's no longer a sum of squares.
[21:30:09] <pikapika> int-e, does not matter
[21:30:10] <Simplar> ...well, oh snap. :|
[21:30:19] <pikapika> since the sums have to be equal
[21:30:29] <pikapika> and the last two digits can be upto 99
[21:30:33] <pikapika> but the first two only upto 39
[21:30:48] <pikapika> it means upto 3999 the analysis is stil lsame
[21:31:16] <pikapika> oh right
[21:31:20] <pikapika> we can't take a sqaure
[21:31:26] <pikapika> the left term will be different
[21:32:00] <pikapika> the range of numbers for the left two digits is (00)...(44)
[21:32:30] <pikapika> so the left sum total combinations will have a different formula

[23:05:45] <sebboh> riv, half a bit, yes.  And, darn, ok.  It boggles my mind that there can be 1.29 billion unused symbols there and no room left to store something.  But yes, as qergle said, I need all 32 bits to go up to 3 billion.  There is one thing I know how to store.. "valid or not".  Simply, if it's greater than 3 billion, it's not valid, a transmission error
[23:05:46] <sebboh> must have occurred.  Is that really the best I can get?  Can I not spread my valid symbols across the space somehow.. uh I don't know what I'd gain in doing that.
[23:07:07] <riv> well you could do this
[23:07:10] <sebboh> riv you mean when I store 3 billion + another 3 billion, in a total of 64 bits, I'd have room for a parity bit.  Sure, I can see it.

[23:08:35] <riv> (this isn't really useful for advisable but thought id mention it)
[23:09:31] <riv> yes that's a good point, you could alternatively double represent some numbers - which would give an extra storage bit on occasion (1.29/3 of the time)

[23:10:47] <riv> it's probably overkill here though
[23:11:44] <sebboh> riv, so if I interleave the used and unused symbols.. instead of keeping them in big blocks. Aka spread the symbols across the space, yes..  Then like, is that *better* in some way?  What does it gain me?  Like, it occurred to me to do it, but I don't know what for. heh

[23:51:45] <riv> X(w) = Sum[n=-inf to inf] x[n] e^(-i w n) = Sum[n=-inf to inf] u(n) e^(-i w n) - u(n-5) e^(-i w n) =
[23:51:58] <riv> i got something different from you
[23:52:41] <riv> we can also shift the second part of the summation, assuming absolute convergence. to get the summand u(n) (e^(-i w n) - e^(-i w (n + 5))
[23:52:52] <riv> may not be valid though
[23:53:37] <millido> riv: Eh, as I understand it that's just a notation thing. To make it clear that it is the function in the complex plane

[23:58:47] <millido> No, that's wrong. It's because that is the transformed function. Thank you though. Your first thing there makes sense
