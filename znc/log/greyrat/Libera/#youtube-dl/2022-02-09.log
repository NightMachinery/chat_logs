[15:49:24] <nimaje> ok, strange and the output of --list-formats?
[16:04:18] <clarkk> nimaje, OK, i have to make an admission. I always use yt-dlp to list formats, because it gives more information (esp the filesize) and in a better format. yt-dlp shows the file with id 139, whereas youtube-dl doesn't.  Is there an obvious reason why?
[16:04:27] <clarkk> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1230116
[16:04:43] <clarkk> See a comparison of the -F output in this pastebin ^^
[16:09:51] <nimaje> yes, that is the problem, for some reason youtube-dl doesn't see some of the formates, thats also why I asked for that output as yt-dlp listed that format for me
