[08:33:38] <coeus> amigojapan, the goal is to bring happiness to the whole world. I can't do that unless I'm happy als
[08:33:43] <coeus> also*
[08:36:51] <coeus> The way it works is people see that your happy and good looking, they will be attracted to you, and want to get to know you better. If you show that you love and care about them, wish them to be happy also, then you start to notice a big change in how they respond
[08:37:57] <coeus> does that sound like narcissism to you?
[08:41:09] <Sapphirus> Alas you age and are no longer good looking. Are you still going to cling onto that cliche? 
[08:42:13] <coeus> I still get womon winking at me
[08:42:25] <coeus> smiling at me
[08:42:32] <Sapphirus> I see what amigojapan was saying. lol
[08:43:16] <amigojapan> coeus: what about when you are 70 
[08:44:05] <amigojapan> coeus: you won't of wanted to marry someone that liked you for your looks then
[08:44:21] <amigojapan> You won't be happy
[08:44:28] <coeus> when I'm 70? that's 30 years from now, I won't even care then
[08:44:51] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I do all the house work too :|
[08:44:52] <amigojapan> 30 years go by in a blink
[08:45:03] <amigojapan> Ouch ButterNoodle 
[08:45:11] <coeus> they way I eat and take care of myself, I will live till I'm 115
[08:45:19] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have a confession to do to you

[08:47:10] <coeus> that's too much exercise at 75 years old
[08:47:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I shaved all my beard :(
[08:47:23] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: if u stroke everyday, you'll never stroke out
[08:47:26] <ButterNoodle> damn
[08:47:29] <coeus> my guess is that it affected his blood circulation

[08:47:44] <ButterNoodle> ....

[08:48:11] <amigojapan> I see coeus maybe. My dad was a health freak
[08:48:15] <coeus> you should only exercise when you are healthy enough for it

[08:49:05] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: only minimum stubble remains
[08:49:09] <ButterNoodle> oof
[08:49:27] <ButterNoodle> well thanks be to the gods for work from home.. it'd grow back in soon
[08:49:45] <coeus> when you are 75 your body weight drops down to about 1/3 of it's maximum
[08:49:55] <coeus> maximum being fat
[08:49:57] <ButterNoodle> idk what I'll do when I have to cleanup for an appearance in front of execs
[08:50:00] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: not as bad as my son. When he got his first electric razor he shaved his eyebrows off lol
[08:50:04] <Sapphirus> I think there's some merit to the old proverb "A light burning too bright will sooner exhaust itself."
[08:50:04] <ButterNoodle> coeus: is that a fact?
[08:50:30] <coeus> unless you have a really healthy metabolic rate, yes
[08:50:45] <coeus> healthy gut means you can eat more food
[08:50:49] <ButterNoodle> I love medical information from the internet
[08:51:11] <ButterNoodle> its almost always sometimes remotely accurate in a sense
[08:51:19] <ButterNoodle> *for some people
[08:51:27] <amigojapan> coeus: my dad's was not fat.i said he was a health freak and he followed a very strict diet
[08:51:56] <coeus> he should have been eating as much good food as he can, short of being fat

[08:55:18] <coeus> when you are 75+, the age when most people get seriously ill and die, you should only excerise for increasing body mass index, which is probably 10-15 minute short exercises

[09:57:10] <Sapphirus> There definitely is a point. For one, it's GPU accelerated, and two it's super performant. 
[09:57:13] <mexen> I find that switching emulators is a matter of how configurable they are. I use terminal but I used  St extensively 2 years ago. I understand alacritty is about speed?
[09:57:28] <mexen> I use terminator*
[09:57:31] <Sapphirus> Further, it's portable and cross platform.
[09:58:52] <Sanras> Sapphirus: I know about the first point of it being GPU accelerated, but I only use a terminal for a few things, and it doesn't usually involve tons of text being output. I don't think I would really benefit from the extra speed. And it being cross platform doesn't matter when I don't use anything other than Linux and Windows
[09:59:21] <Sapphirus> That's fair.

[10:00:08] <Sanras> If you have one that is
[10:00:27] <coeus> no, I don't think it was the fan, sounded more like a pc speaker

[10:03:11] <Sapphirus> and I've heard a few anecdotes about how shitty it is to dock one.
[10:03:33] <coeus> well anyway, I pulled up the reset windows screed and was about to reset my pc when the ticking stopped
[10:03:40] <coeus> screen*
[10:03:44] <Sapphirus> Even my graphics card from the middle of last decade supports MSP ....
[10:03:47] <Sapphirus> what's wrong with Apple?
[10:03:52] <Sanras> How would a software reinstall fix a hardware issue?
[10:04:02] <Sanras> Unless you think it's a software issue
[10:04:22] <coeus> obviously software
[10:05:21] <Sanras> Well, it's hard to tell from your description. A ticking can be many things
[10:05:23] <Sapphirus> I considered getting an M1 Mac Mini to mess around with, but putting up with MacOS is the compromise.
[10:05:34] <MootPoot> record and post vid?
[10:05:49] <Sapphirus> coeus, just download hwinfo to see if your CPU is overheating.
[10:05:51] <Sanras> MootPoot: That's a good idea
[10:05:55] <coeus> it was more like a very low sounding pulse 
[10:06:06] <Sapphirus> That would be one good way to tell if the cooling chassis has bitten the dust.
[10:06:28] <coeus> it's not overheating
[10:06:30] <Sanras> If the fan doesn't sound like a jet engine, I'm sure the temps are fine
[10:06:46] <Sapphirus> No HDD?
[10:07:05] <coeus> his laptob doesn't even have fan
[10:07:11] <coeus> it's completely solid state
[10:07:21] <Sapphirus> Then I have no idea what. 
[10:07:29] <Sanras> You mean it's passively cooled?
[10:07:36] <coeus> HP Corei3 
[10:07:46] <coeus> 2020
[10:07:46] <Sapphirus> I doubt it's passively cooled if it's an HP. lol

[10:18:17] <coeus> I hear no fan whatsoever
[10:18:24] <coeus> nothing
[10:18:46] <Sapphirus> You see that grate on the bottom?
[10:18:49] <coeus> pretty sure I would hear the fan
[10:18:53] <Sapphirus> That's where the air intake is.
[10:19:06] <coeus> there is no air intake

[10:20:20] <Sapphirus> There is. I looked up similar models of laptop and found pictures/video of it disassembled. 
[10:21:00] <Sapphirus> Whether or not you can hear a fan is irrelevant to that fact.
[10:21:55] <coeus> okay
[10:22:00] <Leo--> o/
[10:23:08] <coeus> well, I don't think what I was hearing before was the fan
[10:23:26] <Sapphirus> Air is pulled in through that grate by the heatsink assembly and then exfiltrated back out.
[10:25:16] <Sapphirus> There might be a problem with that assembly. You'll know for sure if it completely dies and your laptop begins to heat up.
[10:25:40] <Sapphirus> And if you don't have a warranty, well tough luck then, I guess.
[10:25:43] <coeus> it has never heated up on me

[12:28:26] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: just watching it for the first time, but I remember being really skeptical of the book
[12:28:43] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: no spoilers, I inted to watch harry potter completly some day
[12:28:53] <KatrinValerie> We had intense history lessons on WW2 at the time, so I was very aware of the anti-semitic imagery in her books
[12:29:26] <KatrinValerie> at first I thought she was going to take this somewhere towards liberation, so the book ending in Harry keeping up the status quo was extremely disappointing
[12:29:41] <KatrinValerie> and the elves as a slave race were always really icky to me
[12:29:53] <KatrinValerie> I never understood why nobody would ever listen to hermoine

[12:30:29] <KatrinValerie> I am sorry
[12:30:34] <amigojapan> its ok

[12:30:46] <amigojapan> I see
[12:31:21] <KatrinValerie> I just remember that the series really killed my interest in reading literature for fun

[12:32:10] <Urchin[emacs]> KatrinValerie: I've read first few novels of Harry Potter as a kid, only regarding it as light throwaway brainless reading for entertainment, never really thought it was worth discussing in any way, so I was always puzzled by the huge fanbase that actually wanted to discuss things

[12:32:36] <Urchin[emacs]> KatrinValerie: always filed it away as something akin to say, Mirai Nikki in qualit
[12:32:41] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it's a gruesome read, because you'll think how could anyone ever think that this man would not set out to exterminate all jews.
[12:33:30] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie, my dad once read it, as a Jew, to know what it was like, he said it is badly written
[12:33:55] <KatrinValerie> The jewish questions was also what united Hitler and Stalin, we should never forget that and be very very watchful for antisemitism
[12:34:06] <KatrinValerie> Because it's a hallmark of totalitarism
[12:34:36] <KatrinValerie> And there are many masks for it
[12:34:43] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: probably not only antisemitism, btu any kind of genocidal stuff
[12:34:58] <KatrinValerie> Even anti-fastistic antisemitism is a thing
[12:35:01] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: true
[12:35:11] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: which is why I am currently so frightened about the US
[12:35:20] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: mein kampf was almost entirely plagiarised, afaik

[12:41:09] <KatrinValerie> nobody adheres to do one thing and do it well anymore
[12:41:20] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie, well, it needs to run ok on android phones, so it cant be very heavy
[12:41:27] <KatrinValerie> lots of libs with lots of functions that are often poorly maintained and optimized
[12:41:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: but it really is a tough problem, you should at the very least use something to parse the grammar
[12:42:11] <KatrinValerie> from there it is easier to create a highlighter for js
[12:42:11] <amigojapan> hmm
[12:42:35] <KatrinValerie> Then you just assign different grammatical constructs different colours
[12:42:46] <KatrinValerie> Eg typenames get green, variable names orange
[12:42:48] <KatrinValerie> or something
[12:43:00] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: after I have the syntax highliting box ready, add save and load buttons, and I think I am done
[12:43:14] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Colours are your choice entirely, I just like retro neon green and orange, reminds me of good old monochrome displays
[12:43:42] <KatrinValerie> The colours just touch me on a deeper level
[12:43:50] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I guess that owudl look cool, but I think a web library woudl support doing that too
[12:43:54] <KatrinValerie> I feel at ease when I see that orange glow

[14:07:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: let me check if it still works
[14:07:31] *** Joins: hok7z (~hok7z@user/hok7z)
[14:08:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah it still works fine, they may take away the page, but I am sure it will remain online
[14:08:29] <MootPoot> It still works but no updates and no more official vanced downloads

[14:15:38] *** Quits: Iolo (~iolo@user/Iolo) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:15:56] <Sapphirus> Just use a mobile browser, like Firefox, with ublock
[14:16:30] <Sapphirus> Vanced was always an overhyped pos imho
[14:19:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: its a hacked youtube client for android that does nto display ads and lets you use all the youtube premium features for free
[14:20:22] <DunceCotus> well no wonder it was shut down
[14:20:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: youtube is shooting itself int he foot, many of us are just not iwlling ot either pay for youtube premium nor  watch with ads... or withought closing our phone screens
[14:20:30] <DunceCotus> Google are IP pricks
[14:20:50] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: youtube may come after ublock origin next
[14:21:11] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: the only mobile browser that allows plugins is firefox
[14:21:41] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: and that does not give you access to other youtube premium featurers
[14:22:40] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, since ublock origin is indiscriminate in its ad blocking capabilities, I doubt it.
[14:22:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the vanced app web page seems to still be there
[14:23:29] <Sapphirus> Very much a security tool because the vast majority of ad networks are filled with garbage.
[14:23:49] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: if youtube really put its head on it, they could force ads by doing things like not serving hte video until enough time has gone by for the ad to have been displayed on the client
[14:24:11] <Sapphirus> Then I will stop using YouTube.
[14:24:24] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: that is easy to say but hard to do
[14:25:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah, the vanced app page is still working, no change
[14:25:29] <Sapphirus> There's tons of YouTube competitors that content creators & podcasters I follow use as alternatives.
[14:25:48] <Sapphirus> YouTube can only push this nonsense so far and going after applications like Vanced is probably as far as they'll go.

[14:26:17] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/igttv1h59qm81.jpg
[14:26:26] <Sapphirus> They may try to may bork ublock origin's functionality in Chromium-based browsers.
[14:26:27] <Sapphirus> That one I can see.
[14:27:03] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/ph8qzsacc5n81.jpg
[14:27:42] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they can legally force them to take the youtube ad blocking off  of it tho, they dont need to hack anything, they have legal support
[14:28:08] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, again, I don't see that happening. 
[14:28:17] <amigojapan> ok
[14:28:53] <Sapphirus> There's almost nothing they can do legally against a browser add-on like ublock origin.
[14:29:02] <Sapphirus> Vanced I can see because it's basically a YouTube application.
[14:29:23] <amigojapan> alright Sapphirus, I hope you are right
[14:29:52] <Sapphirus> One thing I hope I'm wrong on is what they'll try to do to bork add-ons in their browsers.
[14:30:17] <Sapphirus> Google holds a monopoly over the browser market and browser engines.
[14:30:43] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: but doing that could easily tip the people to go back to firefox
[14:30:52] <Sapphirus> Yep
[14:31:03] <amigojapan> its risky business for them
[14:31:20] <Sapphirus> There's no legal means by which they can target gorhill and ublock origin.
[14:31:36] <Sapphirus> Ad blocking in of itself is legal in Canada and the US.
[14:31:58] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I think since they own the plugin sotore they could just ban it too
[14:32:14] <amigojapan> chrome plugin store
[14:32:15] <Sapphirus> They could, but then people would just download Firefox.
[14:32:23] <amigojapan> yup
[14:32:31] <amigojapan> at least people like us
[14:32:37] <Sapphirus> And that's what's going to happen now that Vanced has been shuttered.
[14:32:46] <Sapphirus> People are going to download Firefox mobile and install ublock origin.
[14:32:48] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: on the apple side, they recently allowed safari to have ad blocking
[14:33:17] <Sapphirus> Those who aren't aware of that being an option -- well, they'll put up with YouTube.
[14:33:22] <amigojapan> ublock origin mobile, th ePCplugin does nto work on firefox mobile
[14:33:45] <Sapphirus> Firefox on iOS is basically a shim of webkit/safari
[14:33:47] <Sapphirus> Useless as shit
[14:33:56] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I thin people who are aware of vanced will be aware of firefox too
[14:34:15] <Sapphirus> Firefox Mobile has gotten real good over the past few years, too.
[14:34:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: but I think ti is very recent, but they have ad blocking even on the ipad now
