[10:41:26] <plankers> and watch the look on his face at the end of the day when all the unskilled laborers pick 4 times as much
[10:41:51] <mats1> i hear the new guys get fucked over and have to pick the difficult fruit
[10:41:52] <Joanna> I don’t have any furniture besides low tables and a bookcase
[10:42:01] <plankers> i hear the new guys like to complain a lot
[10:42:02] <mats1> while the old timers know how to avoid the overseers
[10:42:37] <piou> Joanna: imagining that everyone can live like you just because your conditions allow you that lifestyle is arrogant
[10:42:52] <Joanna> plankers: thst would be hard on the back, I guess they eventually develop the proper muscles
[10:43:05] <plankers> almost like they developed a skill for it
[10:43:05] <Joanna> piou: why can’t you ?
[10:43:15] <mats1> there's no question the way things are, tend to be highly unpleasant for the have-nots, and that's just definitionally what a civilisation ~is~, hierarchy
[10:43:17] <piou> Joanna: I happen to do, but I also know that I'm very privileged to do so
[10:43:39] <Joanna> Which part do you do ?
[10:43:43] <plankers> sigh
[10:43:57] <piou> Joanna: different people have different conditions, not everyone has local access to most things, not everyone can compensate physically for the tools that assist them on a daily basis
[10:44:31] <mats1> it is possible for things to work a certain way, because the universe doesn't care about feelings, without it being intrinsically wrong
[10:44:39] <piou> Joanna: I don't own a car, I live rather frugaly, I pay attention to how much energy I waste
[10:45:00] <mats1> airplanes fly in the sky, aren't submarines, though that'd be interesting and cool
[10:45:00] <Joanna> piou: well that’s right people live in places made for cars but the climate control is optional in many places
[10:45:22] <Joanna> piou: are you in france ?
[10:45:24] <mats1> i know its hard not to take it personally
[10:45:31] <piou> Joanna: I happen to be in France yes
[10:45:59] <Joanna> I know French hate air conditioning also :)
[10:46:27] <mats1> you want to change it, then get yours and force your will on the rest of us
[10:47:29] <Joanna> My point is I could live a more wasteful lifestyle like all the people who live around me but I don’t because I don’t want to become weak and dependent upon things like that.
[10:47:37] <mats1> with a pen, a ledger, a checkbook, from the end of a gun or at the head of a rocket division, whatever it takes
[10:48:24] <Joanna> mats1: don’t worry it won’t be me enforcing how you will live it will be people who are far less benevolent:)
[10:49:43] <Joanna> As a matter of fact people are already enforcing how you live and you didn’t notice..

[10:56:12] <mats1> dunno, haven't seen a post mortem on the warship fire yet
[10:56:37] <mats1> its unclear what mistakes were made, if any, that prevented effective fire suppression
[10:57:14] <mats1> the uss miami had a lot of ongoing work that iirc worsened the fire and response to it
[10:57:29] <mats1> wouldn't have happened that way at sea
[10:59:01] <Joanna> I don’t like the tactic of blaming flunkies for big industrial accidents. Like blaming train engineers for texting when the train crashes. Nobody asks why it was physically possible for two trains to have a head on collision. Nobody asks why oil tankers are in the arctic. It’s always the flunkie at fault when. The problem is systematic
[11:00:14] <plankers> the problem is the people who like the system and resist change
[11:00:27] <plankers> the system could totally change without violence, if the stakeholders would let it
[11:00:29] <plankers> they wont, though
[11:00:57] <plankers> fortunately nature seems to be taking care of the violence for us
[11:01:04] <plankers> thanks nature!
[11:02:10] <Joanna> plankers: the problem is that people only pay attention to what they are told to pay attention to they are like a horse with blinkers on
[11:03:04] <plankers> its not that they dont see the problems with their own thinking, its that theyre motivated to forget them when they come across them
[11:03:08] <mats1> there is an element of regulatory capture in these accidents
[11:03:09] <plankers> thats true of anybody
[11:03:34] <Joanna> The system will collapse sooner or later living in luxury and letting other people do your thinking for you makes you a lot less likely to survive
[11:03:53] <mats1> it is possible for gentlemen to disagree on certain points and agree on others
[11:04:01] <plankers> collapse/dissolve slowly and imperceptibly
[11:04:06] <plankers> my money is on the latter
[11:04:13] <mats1> that 'the system' requires reform -- absolutely, i think so
[11:04:36] <plankers> but you do like the system
[11:04:39] <plankers> youve said as much
[11:04:51] <mats1> many people in certain camps believe the solution is an ever greater expansion of the state, and i do not buy that in the least

[11:05:20] <mats1> if 'the system' is the smart ruling over the strong, and them ruling over the stupid and weak, sure
[11:05:20] <plankers> expanding the state without modifying its workings would be catastrophic
[11:05:24] <Joanna> mats1: excessive regulation disempowers people and makes them have the foolish fantasy that other people are making sure everything is safe. Nothing could be further from the truth.

[11:06:44] <mats1> i'll reiterate that i think socialism is best defined -- not as a social welfare state -- as a continuum of the state's participation in the economy
[11:07:03] <plankers> the people who coined the term would disagree
[11:07:35] <mats1> and its this that i think is the primary poison ruining the world today, wherever you look, ru, cn, usa, eu, the state's involvement in economy is obscene
[11:07:37] <Joanna> There are two options.. the option of voluntarily switching to a less opulent life style or suddenly having the opulent lifestyle disappear overnight
[11:07:42] <plankers> socialism without an eventual transition to marxism isnt socialism
[11:08:17] <plankers> but ya know, calling a transition like that several generations ahead of time is a fools errand

[11:09:20] <plankers> hayek missed the mark with his socialist calculation problem

[11:14:41] <plankers> or at least national scale
[11:14:48] <mats1> i wouldn't go that far, but yes, us/cn/ru are by many measures, centrally planned economies
[11:14:58] <piou> Joanna: but being damaged was something that happened very fast, and spices don't keep their value in time as the smell fades away
[11:15:03] <plankers> no no, you misunderstand
[11:15:07] <mats1> whether they work or not, will be a matter for history books
[11:15:14] <plankers> theres no price coordination going on within walmart whatsoever

[11:15:31] <mats1> what
[11:15:45] <plankers> prices only come in when walmart interacts with other entities
[11:15:55] <plankers> but within the organization the price signal isnt used
[11:16:03] <plankers> yet things get where they need to go
[11:16:48] <plankers> really all firms are centrally planned

[11:17:30] <plankers> https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564287/the-peoples-republic-of-walmart-by-leigh-philips-and-michal-rozworski/
[11:17:35] <plankers> book im reading, good stuff
[11:17:39] <mats1> walmart has supply chain like everyone else
[11:18:22] <plankers> an interesting thing about walmarts supply chain: the suppliers actually determine the amount of supply
[11:18:33] <plankers> rather than rely on demand signals to be passed up the chain
[11:18:56] <mats1> ill put it on my list
[11:18:57] <plankers> the latter scenario causes a bullwhip effect which causes supply inefficincies
[11:20:24] <plankers> basically the book is interrogating the huge blindspot people have for all the centrally planned "socialist" activites that take place within market actors
[11:21:04] <plankers> and also asking why we demand democracy in our government but not in our workplaces
[11:21:42] <mats1> lol on this latter item

[11:21:46] <jokoon> hello
[11:21:57] <plankers> funny to you, sad to me
[11:22:05] <mats1> 'flat' hierarchy? like valve? or occupy wall st?
[11:22:24] <plankers> since when is democracy flat
[11:22:42] <jokoon> Ive heard about the usb rubber ducky, how does an OS protect itself from this?
[11:22:56] <mats1> jokoon: usbguard
[11:23:38] <jokoon> mats1, that's not an OS feature
[11:24:04] <mats1> what exactly are you asking? how does an os defend itself against usb HID?
[11:24:10] <jokoon> I mean up to date system cannot protect themselves against this?
[11:24:20] <jokoon> against a rubber ducky
[11:24:25] <mats1> you could lock your workstation
[11:24:48] <piou> jokoon: generally, by doing something like usbguard (and usbguard is just enabling specific configuration on the OS)
[11:24:52] <mats1> plankers: whats the big idea here, everyone from sales to IT gets a referendum every time accounting wants to make an entry in accounts receivable?
[11:25:03] <plankers> sure, thats an idea
[11:25:18] <mats1> that's a bad joke
[11:25:23] <plankers> the "big idea" is that we democratically decide what the idea is
[11:25:30] <jokoon> piou, so OS are not using a secure configuation by default?
[11:25:33] <mats1> some people ethnically despise management, i get it
[11:25:43] <plankers> no, i dont think you do
[11:25:59] <flimsypondreed[m> also how does a HID device bypass auth/lock screens?
[11:26:06] <mats1> it does not
[11:26:16] <flimsypondreed[m> right
[11:26:21] <piou> jokoon: what a rubber ducky does is act like a keyboard. The only difference is that no one is actually typing, it's coming from the chip. There is no way for a computer to prevent that without preventing keyboards in general.
[11:26:26] <piou> jokoon: so no
[11:26:36] <flimsypondreed[m> I think that's the question jokoon  is asking
[11:27:06] <jokoon> piou, can't an OS just not allow a USB device acting both as a USB keyboard and something else?
[11:28:27] <mats1> if societies were small and homogenous again, i could imagine some nominal degree of democracy in the workplace, like a trading or pirate ship
[11:28:51] <piou> jokoon: not really no, not in the general case at least. Besides I'm not convinced that it's acting as a keyboard and something else at the same time, I'd have to check. But USB is made to support multiplexing, and having different devices connected through a single usb port is normal. Think of pluging your mouse and keyboard on a usb hub.
[11:28:53] <mats1> doesn't remotely scale though
[11:29:20] <jokoon> piou, oh I see
[11:29:22] <mats1> too many people 3+ standard deviations from the mean
[11:32:12] <mats1> last thing i'm going to do is risk my life and livelihood by letting some dipshit carry a vote and also slept through trig, algebra, calculus
[11:33:03] <Joanna> mats1: I agree democracy only really works on a small scale
[11:34:22] <mats1> send those fellas to the field, and night class, but anything more and i'll start thinking about giving money and arms to angry men to see the dipshits stepped on

[11:37:18] <plankers> i never said anything about hierarchy at all
[11:37:31] <Joanna> Hmm
[11:38:01] <plankers> once anything gets big enough, you need some level of hierarchy
[11:38:27] <plankers> but to just give up on democracy entirely inside of the workplace for *reasons* makes absolutely no sense to me
[11:38:56] <piou> I guess the difference is that the company has an owner when a nation doesn't
[11:39:02] <circuitbone> tackling the big issues?
[11:39:07] <plankers> unionization is an attempt to graft democracy onto the firm, but not a very effective one

[13:09:11] <piou> Joanna: first of all most people are fully vaccinated in France so there's no issue there, second you can always get a temporary pass with a negative test (which now costs money, but still), and then the conditions aren't very different from what they were during lockdown so people that managed then should manage now even if they don't want to get vaccinated.

[13:12:49] <duude__> It's kind of like, - if the vaccine was a speeding bus. You can either risk getting ran over while walking on a crosswalk or eat an indefinite amount of vaccines in a N period and teleport across

[13:14:25] <duude__> Have you people already had covid, by the way?
[13:14:34] <duude__> I have
[13:14:38] <sebbu> i haven't
[13:14:47] <Apachez> I might have had
[13:14:49] <sebbu> or i didn't notice
[13:14:55] <duude__> Mine was asymptomatic
[13:14:58] <Apachez> got a "cold" in around march 2020 and was down for a week
[13:15:00] <sebbu> i might be a healthy carrier
[13:15:03] <Apachez> but never tested
[13:15:05] <duude__> Family got sick, I didn't
[13:15:09] <duude__> We all tested, I was positive too
[13:15:09] <Apachez> got my first jab a few weeks ago
[13:15:16] <sebbu> never got a jab
[13:15:25] <Apachez> will see when I get my second and can finally develop magnetism and my own 5G cell ;)
[13:15:29] <sebbu> no tests
[13:16:24] <Apachez> its funny how the same antivaxers mixes their claims
[13:16:41] <Apachez> first "we should be on the safe side since we dont know the longterm effects"
[13:16:56] <Apachez> 5 min later "you will become magnetic and emit 5G radiowaves!!!"
[13:17:10] <Apachez> so isnt just the last one a shortterm sideeffect? ;)
[13:17:19] <piou> Joanna: but it can't entirely be a personnal choice. The only way to kill the virus is to trap it in pockets where it can't spread anymore and hope it dies before evolving. The goal of the sanitary pass is to reach heard immunity: as it is a ratio between number of vaccinated people and number of people in circulation the two ways to attain it are either to vaccinate as many people as possible or
[13:17:22] <Apachez> since due to first claim its not been that long on the market?
[13:17:25] <piou> to avoid having as many non-vaccinated people as you can in circulation. Not vaccinating and then circulating puts everyone at risk. There should be a strong incentive not to circulate if you can spread the virus.
[13:17:43] <sebbu> Apachez, you mix antivax and trolls/conspirationists together
[13:17:56] <Apachez> also the claims and counterclaims if the vaccine actually stops the spread or not
[13:17:58] <piou> Joanna: now that incentive should be two-fold: it should also give you the tools to stay at home if you don't want the vaccine, otherwise it's pushing you through the door which is stupid.
[13:18:16] <piou> But still, that's what the sanitary pass is about.
[13:18:21] <sebbu> we had a shot at killing the virus in december 2019
[13:18:24] <sebbu> we didn't took it
[13:18:41] <Apachez> so if the vaccine doesnt stop the spread then its up to me if I want to take a risk with the vaccine or take a risk with a date with ICU and be nude with butt facing up

Last update: 20m ago.
[13:19:53] <piou> Both because the virus is very dangerous and because the vaccine is much better understood than what people think
[13:19:58] <circuitbone> it’s easy to qualify who skipped basic science.
[13:20:00] <Apachez> and the above is confirmed cases
[13:20:11] <Apachez> so out of 199M cases there are 4.24M deaths
[13:20:21] <Apachez> so thats about 2.13% mortality rate
[13:20:57] <piou> Mortality isn't the only outcome though
[13:21:02] <piou> *bad outcome
[13:21:06] <Apachez> and thats a pretty bad "sideeffect" of geting the decease I would say
[13:21:21] <Apachez> yeah but still
[13:21:30] <piou> yeah, that's even worse
[13:21:34] <Apachez> around here the longterm effects claims to be about 2x the mortality rate
[13:21:54] <sebbu> well, as a young person, the risk of covid are LOW
[13:22:05] <circuitbone> #covidiots are awaiting to chat now
[13:22:14] <Apachez> but if I knew that "you will cough for a week and then be fine" then sure I would prefer the real deal instead of a vaccine that might have sideeffects
[13:22:16] <sebbu> isn't like 90% of covid death >70yo ?
[13:22:30] <Apachez> but since 2.13% is in the lottery of total fail Im opting for the vaccine
[13:22:39] <piou> sebbu: I've always hated that "argument". Is it really not important that you pose a risk for others even if young?
[13:22:56] <sebbu> the other pose more of a risk to me
[13:23:13] <sebbu> my risk is low because i don't go out much
[13:23:20] <Apachez> I am also looking forward to become magnetic
[13:23:23] <sebbu> my risk is getting infected
[13:23:25] <Apachez> even if that would probably suck :P
[13:23:27] <piou> sebbu: and mortality isn't the only bad outcome, I've seen people in their 30s that have serious lung scars and are going to need help breathing for years

[13:34:05] <Joanna> piou: I don’t think any source besides personal experience will be good enough to satisfy you :)
[13:34:11] <Apachez> demanding sources even if you dont care for those is just an argumentation technique nowadays

[13:48:03] <TheLinuxNerd> I thank the gov for getting myself vaccinated with 1 dose of Pfizer, for coughing two months blood and for the marvellous gift of having itching rash on my skin, the gov and Pfizer both hold my eternal gratitude :-D and daily I will bless them "may the gov & Pfizer burn in the pits of hell, if there is such a thing as hell"

[13:49:05] <piou> jokoon: segregation is the whole point, what's more problematic is that people should have proper accomodation to stay at home if they don't want to be vaccinated
[13:49:07] <jokoon> To be honest, I think the sanitary pass will be made obsolete when the 4th wave is over, or when another vaccine is needed... But I doubt those 2 things will happen

[22:49:10] <bewees> Is there any security advantage in separating a VM that runs a mirror repository and builds packages for hosts in the LAN from the local webserver that serves the packages to the clients? I think not, as the webserver also is supposed to serve the binary packages to the hypervisor, thus everything is taken over anyways, better to properly secure the webserver right?

[23:22:26] <ajak> ...actual security separation, yes
[23:24:18] <bewees> ajak: if I'd monitor the systems hourly and thoroughly I might act quickly and shutdown the webserver, I think that's out of my "effort model", so I'm going to mingle them together :-)
[23:24:20] <Apachez> bewees: if it builds then it most likely got some private key stored to sign those builds.. pretty bad if an outsider gets access to that

[23:25:13] <bewees> Apachez: Sure, but if the webserver which serves all the built packages to all systems including the hypervisor it's game over too I worry :-)
[23:25:20] <bewees> ajak: Yeah :-)
[23:25:45] <ajak> then no private keys signing binpkgs since you're supposed to trust the binary packages anyway
[23:25:50] <ajak> they're not being distributed by a third party
[23:25:57] <ajak> so there's no benefit to signing them

[23:28:30] <bewees> Good question, I might still add a signature, if I have less trusted clients - less trusted clients can't communicate with trusted clients anyways directly, but upon failure I should encount for that
[23:29:06] <ajak> if your client is untrusted then it shouldn't matter, because hopefully your webserver is read only?
[23:30:35] <bewees> Yes read only, but is it maybe possible that an untrusted client on the same switch can fiddle with the packages that are served via HTTPs to another client?
[23:31:39] <ajak> HTTPS is theoretically not MitM-able
[23:33:12] <bewees> Gotcha, when I reach the task of setting up the repository server I will see if it's a couple more configuration add signature, else I should be fine either way :-)
[23:37:29] <ajak> portage doesn't have native support for signing binpkgs, no
[23:37:37] <ajak> (not afaik, anyway)
[23:37:47] <ajak> because you should trust the server you get binpkgs from
