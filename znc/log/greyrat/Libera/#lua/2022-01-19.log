[00:02:21] <J_Darnley> "self.name = name" will overwrite in self before anything else is done
[00:03:29] <J_Darnley> so when you call that function using Plugin it will write there
[00:06:20] <J_Darnley> you probably want to create the new object first (a table) then assign the new members in that and finally set the metatable (or just the __index member) to Plugin for the methods
[00:08:02] <q66> return setmetatable({name = name, packerConfig = {}, isEnabled = true}, Plugin)
[00:08:11] <q66> and add __index directly into Plugin pointing to self
[00:08:16] <q66> i mean pointing to Plugin itself

[01:14:02] <d1rewolf> Why would this code (https://pastebin.com/xQQE7PM1) give lua: plugin.lua:29: method 'enabled' is not callable (a nil value), even though p is not nil?
[01:15:56] <J_Darnley> table lookups go through the __index key of the metatable (if not found in the first table) and I don't see any __index in this snippet
[01:16:01] <d1rewolf> i feel like i'm missing something obvious, but can't see it. I'm tired :)
[01:16:17] <J_Darnley> p.enabled is nil, Plugin.enabled is a function
[01:16:28] <J_Darnley> but Lua can't get from the former to the latter
[01:17:00] <J_Darnley> q66 said you needed __index in the metatable pointing to Plugin
[01:17:23] <d1rewolf> J_Darnley: ok, yeah, I missed that key point. thank you
[01:18:33] <J_Darnley> You're welcome.  I've forgotten that several times myself
[01:19:34] <q66> each instance needs to be a new table, it has a metatable attached, which is the Plugin; metatable is a table of fallback functions to use when an operation is not otherwise defined (e.g. when looking up a nonexistent field)
[01:19:53] <q66> so by making Plugin your metatable, you declare that Plugin should contain all the fallback operations
[01:20:17] <q66> and __index is special, it can be a function or it can be a table, if it's a table it's the same as if it was a function(self, key) return index_value[key] end
[01:20:39] <q66> so basically by setting __index to Plugin, you make sure that all members not present in the instance will be looked up from Plugni
[01:20:55] <q66> this is what allows method callls to work
[01:21:22] <q66> foo:bla() == foo.bla(foo) == if "bla" is in "foo", look it up, otherwise look it up from __index, then call it with foo
[01:23:05] <q66> (i.e. plugin.__index = plugin is the same as plugin.__index = function(t, key) return plugin[key] end)
[01:30:17] <d1rewolf> q66: great explanation. thanks very much for taking the time

[03:01:15] <d1rewolf> or...is there another remote debugger you would recommend? I'm using lua to develop my neovim config, so being able to interact from another terminal (one not attached to nvim) would really help

[04:29:03] <J_Darnley> Unless the socket module behaves strangely for modern Lua then the require does not create a global of the same name
[04:29:37] <J_Darnley> so you need to assign that table you see printed to some variable then call its functions through that
[04:29:56] <J_Darnley> so in the repl something like: socket = require("socket")

[17:16:39] <jdarnley> I have clearly misunderstood something fundamental about lua posix and exec.  It doesn't return to my Lua code which I now see is clearly stated in the manual for the exec functions.
[17:17:27] <jdarnley> So my question is: how do I start a child process and wait for it to finish before continuing in Lua?
[17:21:39] <kakolainen[m]> just use pcall and read("a")?
[17:23:09] <kakolainen[m]> btw when you have .* at the start of your find pattern it actually starts searching from the end of the string, that's why .* and .+ can be bad with long string
[17:24:07] <jdarnley> Oh I think I was over-thinking it with the string issue.  Too much handling of strings in C recently.

[18:31:31] <d1rewolf> hello all. I am really enjoying the ability to configure neovim with pure lua. However, I really, really could benefit from an interactive debugger. I've tried mobdebug, but get "error loading module 'socket.core' (https://pastebin.com/hRpEaQsm). I assume the embedded lua is not compiled with something mobdebug uses? Is there a way around this or have any of you found a debugger which works with neovim (assuming someone here might be 
[18:31:31] <d1rewolf> a nvim user)?

[18:49:26] <kakolainen[m]> afaik mobdebug only needs sockets, first try if you can get some socket library to work if not then you can try hack mobdebug to use pipe files
[18:57:07] <jdarnley> If "_luaL_prepbuffsize" is the symbol that is not found then does that indicate a version mismatch of Lua headers when building one or more things?

[19:07:55] <kakolainen[m]> Lua 5.1 doesn't have _luaL_prepbuffsize, both mobdebug and sockets will work fine with 5.1

[19:08:39] <d1rewolf> kakolainen[m]: ^
[19:09:25] <d1rewolf> ignore the require("main"). That is inconsequential
[19:09:44] <kakolainen[m]> first you need to figure out which Lua version you are running then install correct version of libraries/change the require path
[19:10:04] <d1rewolf> kakolainen[m]: the local environment lua or the neovim lua? I assume neovim has lua compiled in?
[19:11:01] <kakolainen[m]> just try  print(_VERSION)
[19:12:36] <d1rewolf> kakolainen[m]: Lua 5.1
[19:12:47] <d1rewolf> from within neovim
[19:14:29] <kakolainen[m]> you are using 5.4 library path, get 5.1 libraries and use 5.1 library path
[19:15:26] <kakolainen[m]> about none of the 5.4 libraries will work with 5.1
[19:15:38] * d1rewolf nods.

[20:13:58] <d1rewolf> kakolainen[m]: what would you say the easiest path to getting luasocket installed for 5.1 is? I am on macOS and was able to install lua 5.1 via homebrew (brew install lua@5.1). However, luasocket doesn't appear to be included. would i be better off to try to install everything from source?
[20:14:59] <d1rewolf> are any of the lua version managers maintained? I see luaver and lenv
[20:16:01] <kakolainen[m]> are you using zerobrane?
[20:16:43] <d1rewolf> kakolainen[m]: I have zerobrane, but not using it at the moment

[21:37:03] <technomancy> on the other hand installing libs that have C in them without apt tends to be nightmarish so it's just a matter of lesser of two evils.
