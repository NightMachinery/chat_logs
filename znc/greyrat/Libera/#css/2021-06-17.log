[08:06:46] <Auctus> you can see on the right how im achieving it with solid color, im creating 2 overlapping divs to "cut" chunks out of the solid border

[15:25:08] <entuland> test them big enough and in isolation to verify if it really is the icons or something else in your page
[15:26:06] <entuland> some icons have more "visual weight", so to speak, off center, even if their bounding box is perfectly balanced, and that may throw you off
[15:26:37] <DrowningElysium> Yeah, it's more the visual weight

[19:27:26] <jwpapi> How can I make my site exactly 100% high, so that it’s not scrollable?
[19:32:05] <scara> I want content of div to not wrap, I rather have scroll bars, that would be less broken on small screens
[19:35:29] <entuland> jwpapi, you can force the body / main div to be position: fixed; inset: 0; and clip any overflow
[19:36:14] <entuland> scara, there is no need to have it "partially broken" - you can control all the layout at any breakpoint and make so it looks good on small screens
[19:36:43] <entuland> in both cases, jwpapi and scara, it would be useful to share your live page or a working fiddle so that we can see what you actually are dealing with
[19:36:51] <scara> I have no idea how CSS works, I just used this https://codepen.io/Pestov/pen/BLpgm
[19:37:17] <entuland> then you should start getting a grip on the basics: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
[19:37:22] <scara> I just have https://codepen.io/Pestov/pen/BLpgm but with more items defined
[19:37:42] <entuland> I dislike codepen cause it doesn't let users save if they're not registered, consider using jsfiddle instead
[19:37:50] <entuland> where anyone can fork, save and re-share
[19:38:13] <entuland> jsfiddle or any other online sandbox that doesn't force registering
[19:38:23] <scara> 1 moment, I would have to redact names
[19:38:30] <entuland> no rush
[19:39:37] <entuland> by the way, it's likely impossible to make such trees look good on a small screen without altering how you lay the tree out
[19:39:57] <entuland> there simply isn't enough space to keep that layout with a large horizontal tree
[19:40:32] *** Joins: rapha (~jrs@user/rapha)
[19:40:34] <rapha> hi all
[19:40:39] <entuland> o/
[19:40:50] <rapha> is there a way with CSS to insert an empty page in the middle between two paragraphs when printing?
[19:41:15] <entuland> sure, you have control over the page breaks with CSS
[19:41:33] <entuland> did you check the available properties on the docs about the print media?
[19:42:04] <scara> jsfiddle wont work, the box is empty
[19:42:21] <entuland> you may have forgot to add some libraries or the alike, scara
[19:42:29] <entuland> also, you need to run after you make the changes
[19:42:29] <scara> ??
[19:42:41] <scara> still, run does nothing
[19:42:47] <entuland> save and share it anyways
[19:42:54] <scara> Can I not just make it scroll?
[19:43:05] <entuland> hard to say without seeing your code
[19:43:21] <entuland> of course you can force it not to scroll, the point is _how_ exactly
[19:43:26] <scara> https://jsfiddle.net/eyq3zcg9/ nut it wont let me see the code so idk
[19:43:35] <scara> but*
[19:43:54] <entuland> that fiddle seems working, I can see the tree on the output box
[19:44:23] <scara> Oh there we go
[19:44:41] <scara> it works for me too, I had acidentaly pressed blocked instead of allow
[19:45:04] <entuland> now, that technique with absolute positioning is going to make a mess when the page shrinks
[19:45:06] <scara> I want this to work on small phones, its okay if it scrolls
[19:45:19] <entuland> the easiest solution is to force the width of the container
[19:45:29] <entuland> so that it won't get shrunk
[19:45:35] <scara> As I said above, I have no idea how CSS works, I just know basics like how to color things
[19:45:58] <entuland> and as I said above, if you have to deal with these things, you'd need to study the basics a little better
[19:45:59] <scara> I used that codepen above
[19:46:12] <scara> CSS is so confuseing
[19:46:15] <entuland> you need to have some understanding of how it works if you need to adapt it
[19:46:22] <entuland> everything can be confusing if you don't know it
[19:47:25] <scara> true
[19:48:26] <scara>  width: 1200px;
[19:49:26] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/wh8f3Le1
[19:49:27] <entuland> yes
[19:49:49] <entuland> 1000px should be enough in that specific case, but you'll need to account for the names width in your real case
[19:50:15] <entuland> the border there is just to have a clue at where the box ends
[19:50:53] <entuland> the overflow: auto; on the body isn't really necessary, ignore that
[19:51:08] <scara> heh?
[19:51:12] <entuland> eh
[19:51:14] <scara> what are you talking about
[19:51:21] <entuland> I'm talking about my fiddle
[19:51:34] <entuland> you can have the entire page scrollable horizontally to account for that large div
[19:51:35] <scara> Doesn't say so
[19:51:43] <scara> Whare are you seeing body?
[19:51:45] <entuland> yes, it does at the top of the CSS
[19:51:56] <scara> no?
[19:51:57] <scara> ...
[19:51:59] <entuland> in _my_ fiddle
[19:52:14] <scara> I can't see your fiddle
[19:52:20] <entuland> did you click on my link?
[19:52:30] <scara> I did now...
[19:52:55] <entuland> the point there is that you can either have the whole page scroll horizontally, or only your specific div
[19:53:04] <entuland> which would likely be better on a small screen
[19:53:55] <entuland> but that technique of using relative and absolute positioning makes it a mess
[19:54:20] <scara> I don't know
[19:54:21] <entuland> cause the "div.tree" element isn't growing in height, all the descendants are overflowing
[19:54:36] <entuland> yeah, there are a lot of technical subtleties to be aware of with that design
[19:55:06] <entuland> not something you can easily grasp without studying CSS better
[19:55:31] <scara> I tried to make my own but it kept makeing a line
[19:55:50] <entuland> I would probably use a grid layout there
[19:56:09] <entuland> where you have better control of the placement and you can also obtain overlapping of the tree branches
[19:56:50] <entuland> alternatively, use a graph library leveraging on JS
[19:57:16] <scara> oh see this works .tree li {float: left;text-align: center;list-style-type: none;}
[19:57:18] <entuland> I'm sure there are such libraries out that would simplify your life a lot if you need to make many different trees like that
[19:58:04] <scara> What would javascript help with? it would just change the css, why not just add the css to begin with
[19:58:23] <entuland> it would help rearranging the graph according to the available space
[19:58:38] <scara> I don't know
[19:58:45] <entuland> https://dzone.com/articles/top-6-javascript-family-tree-diagram-libraries
[19:59:22] <scara> Well thank you
[19:59:27] <entuland> way better than rolling your own or trying to adapt that mess of floats you found
[20:00:12] <entuland> yw

[20:00:55] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[20:01:01] <scara> seems that ul>li does the same
[20:01:18] <scara> ohhh wait couldn't I just flip the entire thing 90 degrees?
[20:01:19] <entuland> that's just about how you store / present your data in the markup
[20:01:28] <scara> flip: deg(90) or something
[20:01:38] <entuland> yes, but that may not be a good idea
[20:02:26] <entuland> it's up to the user to decide whether to use your website in portrait or landscape mode
[20:03:14] <entuland> if you only need to do a single tree, feel free to hack what you have found away by hardcoding the dimensions and call it a day
[20:03:31] <entuland> if you need to extend it in the future or create multiple trees, use a library
[20:04:17] <entuland> if you don't need any interaction or reflowing, create the tree with some program and save it as an image, and call it a day again :P
[20:04:23] <scara> Javascript bad tho
[20:04:28] <entuland> why bad?
[20:04:42] <scara> Most libraries are minified and sometimes ofuscated
[20:04:54] <scara> you would also have to trust the site admin
[20:05:01] <entuland> uh?
[20:05:02] <scara> I hope one day it will die out
[20:05:28] <entuland> if you don't like obfuscated libraries, find one that isn't obfuscated - minified is okay
[20:05:36] <entuland> in the end it's not like you have to touch or alter the library
[20:05:45] <entuland> I don't get what you mean with trusting the side admin
[20:05:57] <scara> Javascript is used a lot to track users and has had security vulnerabilities. I also see some websites (though its rare) that have javascript that can crash your browser or atleast make it super laggy
[20:06:18] <entuland> if you're paranoid about that investigate on the libraries you plan on using
[20:06:19] <pavonia> JS will likely be replaced by wasm, an even more obfuscated code :p
[20:06:23] <rapha> entuland: thx got it working with 2 page breaks and a space in between them
[20:06:37] <entuland> yw rapha, glad you were able to sort it out
[20:06:51] <scara> Even if I trust a library, I could never dream of forceing my family to run the javascript
[20:07:11] <entuland> then either learn CSS to use a proper grid layout, or store that tree as an image
[20:07:19] <entuland> or hack away that mess of floats you've found
[20:07:24] <entuland> you have plenty of non-JS solutions
[20:08:31] <entuland> that technique with floats and relative / absolute positioning is a true headache, IMANHO

[20:10:43] <entuland> another alternative is building that tree in a vector program and save it as SVG
[20:12:04] <entuland> the advantage of the SVG approach is that you could still style it with CSS and add interaction without using JS and without having to learn the grid layout
[20:12:53] <entuland> you could as well write some code that builds that SVG out from your tree data automatically
[20:13:16] <scara> How would this be easier in SVG=
[20:13:18] <entuland> so that you just have to update a file on the server and the server side code generates the SVG as needed
[20:13:36] <entuland> I didn't say it would be easier (although it could be)
[20:13:39] <scara> I don't think you could even do this in svg
[20:13:40] <entuland> it's just another approach
[20:13:46] <entuland> sure you can
[20:14:19] <entuland> http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2021/03/svg-family-tree-generator-v60.html
[20:15:34] <entuland> that's just an example showing how not only it can be done, but it's being done, I found that page just by googling, I can't endorse it
[20:15:53] <scara> I have a headech now
[20:16:35] <entuland> yeah, too much stuff at once without the proper basics - just decide what you want to achieve as end goal and then you can decide how to achieve it
[20:16:44] <stenno> /??.>....
[20:16:48] <stenno> sorry
[20:17:08] <entuland> eheheh, coding in B*F or something? :P
[20:17:15] <stenno> i knew it :P
[20:17:22] <stenno> any code is valid bf
[20:17:26] <entuland> ehehehe
[20:17:41] <stenno> the interpreter just ignores all the characters that aren't bf
[20:18:02] <entuland> sometimes I'll study the Piet language :P
[20:18:14] <stenno> i recommend malbolge for a good time
[20:18:40] <entuland> oh god
[20:18:46] <entuland> speaking of headaches ahahaha
[20:18:57] <stenno> mhm
