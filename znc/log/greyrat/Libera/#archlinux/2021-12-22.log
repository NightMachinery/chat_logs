[00:56:33] <alschaapman> I don't care for Chromium personally, but as you may be aware, a lot of web app developers target it, which may be a worthwhile consideration if the problem you're trying to solve is specifically that a web app you're using is broken

[02:15:02] <sharperguy> Anyone know of a very simple tool that allows you to run several long-running scripts in paralell and view their output in real time? I.e something like a very lightweight systemd that runs as a user in a single directory.
[02:15:52] <Foxboron> sharperguy: systemd-run and use journalctl?
[02:16:32] <tansabau> don't you just mean something like tail -n?

[02:18:39] <sharperguy> tansabau: well one option would be to just open several terminals and then just run each script in each one. Another would be to start both in the background from a single script. You could also automate starting them in screen sessions and use screen to switch between the output of each program. But i thought there might be a premade solution. 
[02:19:11] <sharperguy> systemd-run seems to need root priviledges so that would be overkill for this purpose i guess

[02:21:48] <BrainDamage> sharperguy: use --user
[02:22:13] <BrainDamage> sharperguy: if you want a standalone tool: task-spooler
[02:22:26] <Namarrgon> cambrian_invader: that's the universal version
[02:22:27] <MrElendig> might want to enable linger if you intend to exit the user session
[02:22:31] <Foxboron> cambrian_invader: You log into the wiki and select which style you want
[02:22:45] <Foxboron> cambrian_invader: If you want the old style there are some CSS that needs to be patched
[02:23:01] <sharperguy> ok 'systemd-run --user' seems to work ok. I will look into task-spooler as well. Thanks!
[02:23:31] <Foxboron> sharperguy: systemd-run allows you to essentially make ephemeral "services". It's quite neat even though I havent personally used it a lot
[02:23:54] <sharperguy> yeah i tend to mess with systemd services a lot so at least i know how to work with them
[02:23:56] <NetSysFire> systemd-run is great but i recall some problems with units persisting, so --transient may be important

[04:00:08] <mefistofeles> yeah, because 'murica
[04:00:11] * mefistofeles shrugs
[04:00:20] <MacGyver> I find dd/mm/yyyy almost equally silly.

[04:01:03] <mikebutash> I've been threatened to be banned once already today for cursing, must be the season.

[04:02:21] <mefistofeles> mikebutash: well, you expecting everyone to be okay with it is also rather thin-skinned
[04:02:36] <mefistofeles> regardless of the fact of it being just rude, most of the time
[04:02:46] <nothereisnotanam> I got used to mm/dd/yy or yyyy, the seperation doesnt really matter to me s long as its not `:`
[04:04:21] <mikebutash> not like I was cursing at someone, just joking around and heaven forbid trying to even be helpful.
[04:04:22] <mefistofeles> for me dd/mm/yyyy is only ambiguous because there are some preferring mm/dd/yyyy
[04:05:12] <mefistofeles> dd/mm/yyyy denotes the hierarchy, whereas the other... can be anything
[04:05:16] <mikebutash> why it's been like 20 years since using irc last for me until recently.
[04:05:32] <d42> hello i use arch btw
[04:05:44] <nothereisnotanam> for some reason, I prefer full month names, becuase it prevents confusion between the day and month, and xxxx for years

[04:08:11] <nothereisnotanam> hard to break old habits of reading it that way

[08:08:43] <jcfrosty> I've got a question after going over the PKGBUILD rules. Is there a Comment method for software author?
[08:08:54] <thurstylark> for what purpose?
[08:09:37] <jcfrosty> I see there is # Maintainer , but I do wish to make sure I'm giving credits to the author.
[08:10:09] <jcfrosty> Yeah, the URL links to their GITHUB, but even so, it just feels appropriate.
[08:10:11] <sheep> the author of the PKGBUILD or of the thing that is packaged?
[08:10:22] <jcfrosty> the thing that is packaged
[08:10:44] <thurstylark> you can put whatever in a comment, but it's not common to credit the upstream author since they're, you know, upstream
[08:10:50] <sheep> the standard way to attribute that is with the url
[08:11:20] <jcfrosty> I just didn't want to do that and cause issue when I submit the PKGBUILD to AUR.
[08:11:33] <jcfrosty> Its an OBS plugin that is very handy.
[08:11:53] <thurstylark> unless it's offensive or whatever, comment contents aren't really paid attention to
[08:12:29] <jcfrosty> Cool, greatly appreciate the insight!

[09:38:15] <jensen> i cloned a repo, made some changes, and now want to create a patch. How can `diff --unified --recursive --text` command to create patch ignore the .git repo which contains binaries that's messing with the patch?
[09:38:52] *** Joins: iqexception (~iqexcepti@180.175.152.191)
[09:38:57] <rcf> jensen: I generally use git itself to create the patch 
[09:39:01] <rcf> i.e. git diff 
[09:39:18] <grawity> jensen: if you cloned a git repo, why would you not be using `git diff` or even `git format-patch`?
[09:39:47] <grawity> the "proper" way of making a patch is to *commit your changes*, then `git format-patch -1` to get a formatted .patch file of the last 1 commit
[09:39:59] <grawity> or generally of however many commits you made
[09:40:58] <grawity> (you don't really need to deal with forks, or branches, the clone is in itself a "local fork" that you can commit whatever)
[09:41:44] <rcf> Branches are nice if you plan on keeping the clone around for a while
[09:41:45] <grawity> but if you don't even want to git commit, then `git diff HEAD` or `git diff @` will automatically show all changes since the current commit
[09:42:02] <grawity> well, most likely so will `git diff` alone, unless you git-add'ed something by accident.

[09:50:05] <jensen> the patch is based on original package's PKGBUILD. when official package updates, pacman will see my patched package of the same name and notify me? How can I automate applying my patch to the original package and install?
[09:50:41] <grawity> 1) no, 2) you don't really

[17:07:17] <earnestly> What happens?
[17:07:18] <colo> earnestly, no, it's not. msft has rather "strict" (i.e., stupid) rules for IP (host AND network) reputation.
[17:07:43] <earnestly> I've read about this awhile ago, thought that might be more solved by now
[17:07:51] <colo> but the good thing about msft/hotmail postmasters is that you can contact an actual human being behind all the automated nonsense

[17:10:22] <jkc> The Before Times
[17:10:31] <colo> problems arise whenever these networks' operators also gobble up services that the actual Internet relies on (such as mail)
[17:10:37] <earnestly> jkc: The future that was
[17:10:49] <BrainDamage> the push towards https, if extended to local networks, paired with completely unfair treatment of self signed certs might force local service to depend on remote ones
[17:11:09] <earnestly> BrainDamage: Or they split off and form their own trust
[17:11:32] <jkc> The treatment of self-signed certs isn't unfair, they're worthless for the purpose of identity assertion. That's the main objective behind PKI.
[17:12:17] <earnestly> jkc: That argument applies to LE too
[17:12:35] <BrainDamage> jkc: correct, but http gets less warnings and weird mating dances than self signed
[17:12:35] <jelle> earnestly: with LE you proof you are X however :)
[17:12:38] <earnestly> So self-signed should be treated the same as lets encrypt certs
[17:12:39] <jkc> earnestly: It doesn't, actually. With LE you have to prove to at least some degree that you control the names going into the cert.
[17:12:40] <colo> jkc, I think it's indeed pretty unfair how the common "warning" signs are worded.
[17:13:09] <colo> there'd be no shame in having TOFU on the TLS-secured web the way we it is commonplace with SSH
[17:13:12] <jkc> BrainDamage: Because http isn't making an identity claim at all.
