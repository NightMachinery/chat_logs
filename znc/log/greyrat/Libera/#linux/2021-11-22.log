[04:38:09] <jim> Psi-Jack, after leaving kde and trying other DEs, which one did you settle on?
[04:38:17] <ayecee> the mail logs should describe the mail that was relayed - sender address, recipient, etc.
[04:38:39] <ayecee> which would only be helpful if the ransomware was using the smtp relay to send mail
[04:38:50] <Psi-Jack> Gnome, actually.
[04:39:11] <Psi-Jack> Took a bit of getting used to, but it's faster, more reliable, and cleaner, in my experience.
[04:39:11] <jim> really... which were the top 3 contenders?
[04:39:33] <Psi-Jack> Gnome, and Xfce only.
[04:39:37] <ionface> fluxbox/openbox so clean and zippy though
[04:39:42] <Psi-Jack> Gnome 3, specifically.
[04:40:13] <Psi-Jack> Also not a DE.
[04:40:21] <jim> was the decision pretty easy?
[04:40:35] <TJ-> namkeleser: you've got to consider if the SMTP relay host itself was compromised; everything from manipulating logs to remove traces of its actions to dropping a payload that is waiting for a trigger event

[04:44:09] <TJ-> namkeleser: handcuffing the experts?
[04:44:23] <ayecee> namkeleser: err, how about a disk image of the server
[04:44:35] <TJ-> any network that has a ransomware attack needs taking offline and rebuilding

[04:47:00] <Psi-Jack> knotMez: But, it's how I feel. I think "desktop icons" are hard to get to, pointless, and I really like the dashboard approach that Gnome 3 introduced which is much easier, faster, and less clustered.

[08:46:19] <Disposeable-Nick> neshpion, I know I am pushing it, but how would I add some lovely colour to it? (it: exec speedtest-cli --simple | paste -sd% | sed "s/%/ || /g") So, like Ping:, Download: and Upload: are coloured, or bold, bold doesn't really matter, nor the specific colour, anything you wanna make it
[08:46:53] <Lemniscate> Neshpion, let's talk about your hourly rate of pay. :D
[08:46:59] <Disposeable-Nick> lololol
[08:47:33] <Disposeable-Nick> Can be pink if you so choose
[08:47:55] *** Joins: takimbal_ (~takimbal@linuxhq/tkimball)
[08:48:33] <Disposeable-Nick> I would have used fast-cli instead as it has colour already, but I don't think it is supported on ARM systems

[08:49:18] <bindi> iirc
[08:49:52] <bindi> assuming you want it formatted for irc, you mentioned eggdrop right

[08:50:34] <Disposeable-Nick> I did, but the code is being exec'd, so I think the colour has to happen system side? Like, I also exec inxi and pydf, which already have nice colour

[08:55:07] <Disposeable-Nick> It would be nice to have the nice allignment for that as it is on the shell, but it's fine.

[08:58:02] <bindi> just add \x03NN and \x03 between things you want to color in the printf

[09:00:32] <Disposeable-Nick> That's missing from the above image
[09:00:35] <bindi> use the version neshpion pasted
[09:01:06] <bindi> but again you should really just "exec speedtest-cli --csv" and parse the csv in tcl
[09:01:10] <bindi> imo

[16:13:42] <TJ-> ychaouche: per cgroup ... you create a cgroup (delegated from the systems cgroup) and then put one or more processes into that cgroup. On your cgroup you can add whichever controllers the parent cgroup has allowed, and then you can set limits as appropriate for each controller you've delegated. You can also (with cgroups v2) further delegate from "your" cgroup new child cgroups that get to share in

[22:57:23] <Linkandzelda> i see, thats cool then
[22:57:39] <koollman> Linkandzelda: I would start with a bunch of vm. typical tiny deployment would be one vm, which is nice to play with but not very interesting. Next challenge is generally more vm, at least more 'workers'. then even more vm, to get redundacy on the control-plane side
[22:57:54] <legend> vms ewww
[22:58:00] <koollman> then, if you need even more, add physical machines

[22:59:38] <Linkandzelda> koollman: i was planning to get a large host box with enough resources for at least a bunch of worker nodes. and i would tell it to spin up any extra nodes in the cloud and delete as needed. because then at least it always has nodes to work with and im not spending on the cloud 24/7
[22:59:55] <koollman> Linkandzelda: depends how much stuff you want to run
[23:00:18] <Linkandzelda> i've got about 20 VMs active right now, so probably a lot
[23:00:19] <koollman> Linkandzelda: but if you're just starting to learn about kubernetes, don't plan too large at first
[23:00:53] <Linkandzelda> i'll start small, 1-2 workers, and play around with that and see how it works
