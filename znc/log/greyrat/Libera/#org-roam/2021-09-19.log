[05:44:18] <rdrg109> I'm creating a node for a single piece of knowledge that I get to know, I think I will end up with 1000 nodes at the end of the day. I'm now wondering if there's considerable delays when getting to an specific number of nodes.
[05:44:27] <rdrg109> Probably, <10.000?

[23:25:01] <meliache[m]> <rdrg109> "I'm creating a node for a single..." <- To handle large amount of nodes, org-roam stores metadata such as title, aliases, and tags in an sqlite database. Querying databases even with > 10'000 entries is fast. That means that all org-roam functionalities like finding a node by title or tag or getting all backlinks to a node should have no issues with large databases.
[23:25:01] <meliache[m]> However, there are some limitations if you do non-org-roam things with your org-roam files. E.g you can't add you entire org-roam-directory to your org-agenda-files, this would slow org-agenda down because it would need to open all files (however, you can decide to include all org-roam files with a specific tag in your agenda. There was a discourse discussion and system crafters video on that). Also, building a large graph of your org-roam
[23:25:01] <meliache[m]> database might take longer. Also, in case you accidentally nuke your database, it might take a while rebuilding it, but usually this is something that only needs to be done once
