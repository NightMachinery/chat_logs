[10:32:18] <GodEater> awesome - thanks ;)
[10:33:10] <GodEater> is there a way to get get curl to list which SSL ciphers it supports? Or do I just get openssl to list the ones it does, and assume that curl was built against the same version?
[10:33:57] <Piru> since not all backends have such feature I doubt it
[10:34:05] <GodEater> ok
[10:35:34] <Piru> the cipher selection used depends on the tls version, of course
[10:35:47] <Piru> 1.3 has different selection vs < 1.3
[10:37:09] <Piru> https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html has some details, but it of course is not the complete picture
[10:37:59] <GodEater> yeah, don't worry. The curl version in question is 7.15.5 - I'm pretty confident that's too old to speak the TLS cipher in question.
[10:39:07] <Piru> also some openssl versions don't enable all ciphers, and only allow it when specifically asked for it
[10:39:24] <Piru> and that depends entirely on how openssl was built, and curl can't directly affect that
[10:39:32] <Piru> so yeah, not a simple topic this :-)
[10:39:33] <GodEater> no I know
[10:39:56] <GodEater> I'm just going with "our version of curl is super old and for $REAONS we can't upgrade it so you need to use a well old cipher. Soz mate."
[10:40:14] <Piru> and runtime selection via openssl config file, plus env variables .. @SECLEVEL=x etc fun times
[10:40:41] <GodEater> yeah, this is a wormhole I'm not going down.
[10:41:07] <Piru> it caused some havoc when debian based OSes switches to seclevel 2. all kind of connections started to fail (and not just because of ciphers)

[15:50:03] <p-i-> I'm using PyCurl, but as it's a thin wrapper around libcurl maybe I can ask here. I'm using PyCurl to periodically poll a URL. As it's a generic curl wrapper I'm setting c.setopt(c.URL, url) each time.
[15:50:19] <bagder> (added now)
[15:50:42] <p-i-> Am I losing efficiency here, or is libcurl able to remember prior requests, and that this one is for the same URL as previously?
[15:51:05] <p-i-> i.e. is there a better way to approach the task when the URL doesn't change between fetches
[15:51:16] <bagder> p-i-: in libcurl all options  ypu set are "sticky". They remain set in the handle until you change them
[15:51:25] <bagder> so using the same handle again, will mean using the same options

[17:21:08] <p-i-> Otherwise that happens

[17:43:19] <roxlu> What is a common way to deal with nonce timeouts when doing http-digest auth? e.g. let's say I want to perform a request using http-digest auth and I know it will expire after ~5min. it would be great if I could somehow refresh the auth/nonce before it times out.

[18:30:42] * Piru is delighting his neighbours by blasting some SIDs from the Ultimate64
[18:35:10] <bagder> \o/
[18:42:20] <Piru> Got some real SID chips on board and Ultimate64 performs analog->digital conversion from the real chip output and muxes it to the HDMI output. handy :>
[18:44:03] <Piru> the player even picks the correct chip depending on the metadata stored on the .sid .. so both 6581 and 8580 play correctly out of the box. super neat
[18:44:35] <Piru> hmm I wonder if the control application is using libcurl
[18:46:39] <Piru> oh, it's java.
[18:48:32] <bagder> the source tree for MS office apparently has 2 million files, now converted to git
[18:52:12] <Piru> microsoft has some insane git repo. the reason they created GVFS
[18:52:35] <bagder> I'm watching a talk about perf improvements they did to git in order to make this conversion possible
[18:52:48] <Piru> yeah yes. indeed that's the GVFS thing
