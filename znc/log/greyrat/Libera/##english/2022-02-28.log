[00:09:37] <chat> GuiToris thinks blkshp meant to say: TimMc: there are no letter breaks
[00:09:56] <huf> TimMc: it's how we used telegraphs I think, which is probably a method adapted from the germans (it nearly always is, with us)
[00:09:59] <huf> so you know
[00:10:12] <huf> but they probably also had special codings for them
[00:10:14] <huf> cos why the fuck not
[00:10:14] <blkshp> GuiToris: I learned it basically that it would teach me the bleeps and I would press the associated letter until i could answer 3 for each letter of the alphabet and numbers and I got 3 lives!
[00:10:46] <blkshp> The receiving that was but now I am moving to the 'sending' which means i have to send the letters which is a little harder.

[01:02:04] <blkshp> If someone said that it means that the persons sorry is generally meaningless becuase they have done whatever they said sorry for before many times.

[07:49:13] <twb> "to effect [a change]", as a verb, is doing the thing intentionally.

[08:24:07] <Cashlin> like when i feel that way i could chalk it up to a mixture of jealousy and bitterness but not a regular kind of jealousy or bitterness, its more of a being reminded of your depression from seeing others happy
