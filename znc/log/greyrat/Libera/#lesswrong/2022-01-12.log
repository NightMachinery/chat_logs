[01:08:40] <Betawolf> clearly all anyone needs to do is move around the few city blocks in which they spend their entire life, buying everything the day that they need it, and of course there's not much in the way of groceries because they live and will die alone.

[07:01:30] <PapuaHardyNet> that's how I sometimes see such tweets
[07:02:22] <gwern> it's very clever! we feel sure cc12m will grow up to go to harvard, it shows such promise
[07:02:34] <adiabatic> not the worst art
[07:02:48] <adiabatic> some of these have a Monument Valley vibe
[07:03:21] <rmmh> Once someone figures out a good way to scale AI art up to 60MP print quality...
[07:04:11] <gwern> (and that's pretty much my attitude: "look how good and creative it already is! now imagine these sorts of models with another order or two compute!")
[07:04:38] <gwern> (where tera-scale models are my 'admitted to harvard', but far more practical a plan)
[07:06:00] <adiabatic> how do we get two OOM compute? Is Moore's Law still working? Kind of?
[07:06:05] <gwern> yes
[07:06:30] <gwern> I figure 1OOM is a lower bound for getting average quality without cherrypicking + a 2x resolution increase to >512px to the point where people will be forced to say 'ok shit yeah that's human level and creative alright', and 2OOM seals the deal
[07:06:41] <adiabatic> all I know about computing enhancements have come out of TSMC and the massive improvements there have all been in the performance-per-watt space
[07:08:46] <gwern> that's an important metric. jcannell would argue that it's really the only metric you care about
[07:10:14] <adiabatic> it still blows my mind that my laptop charges slowly off an iPad charger unless I'm really sucking down the power
[07:10:32] <adiabatic> and it's about as powerful as my Xeon-based desktop
[07:10:52] <adiabatic> probably faster

[07:27:04] <rmmh> gwern: I figure slightly context aware upscaling models for subregions should be sufficient-- like how hard could it be for a related model to embellish a small region with fine detail given the same prompt 
[07:28:27] <gwern> I'm a bit more concerned about learning and global structure. you'd think that filling in a small region would be super-easy but upscaling is still not solved and you can clearly see it's upscaling when you plug something like ruDALL-E samples into an upscaler, or put too-small anime images into an ESRGAN a few times
[07:29:05] <gwern> I think it's like how the lines in river's art often aren't sharp enough or aligned enough globally. if you feed a crooked line into an upscaler, it has no choice but to make a larger crooked line. it wouldn't dare uncrook it
[07:29:23] <rmmh> It's weird, given how texture obsessed neural nets are
[07:30:36] <gwern> the texture will make sense locally, but not globally. the crooked line makes perfect sense locally. it's just crooked globally
[07:37:57] <gwern> at least, this is my theory for what's going wrong with AI art samples right now. the textures don't *quite* line up. the pixels aren't *quite* exactly straight. these are the final low-order bits, and it doesn't snap into coherency and patterns yet
[07:38:15] <nshepperd2> I'm hoping training a cfg upscaler will help that problem
[07:38:38] <gwern> so you can't just plug your 512px samples into a nice 512px->2048px upscaler and expect to out pop flawless art
[07:38:41] <nshepperd2> by letting you tell the net to rely more on priors and less on the low res input, to allow it to uncrook the line
[07:38:55] <gwern> cfg?
[07:39:08] <rmmh> I'm sure someone will figure it out soon 
[07:39:24] <nshepperd2> "classifier free guidance", a diffusion thing where you lerp the diffusion model with different inputs
[07:40:08] <gwern> ah, that. not sure it'll make any critical difference. it's nice but what makes it qualitatively difererent from any other diffusion or gan upscaler?
[07:41:17] <nshepperd2> well, you can lerp between the upscaler model given the low res input, and the same model with no input, to control the strength of conditioning
[07:41:35] <nshepperd2> we'll just have to try it to see if it's actually any good
[07:43:27] <gwern> I don't think the extra conditioning will 'override' the crookedness. at least not without a lot of global context. after all, it was conditioned in the first place to generate the crooked lines
[07:43:50] <nshepperd2> maybe but it's running at  a different scale to the original output
[07:43:56] <gwern> maybe some sort of iterative process where it heavily renoises and then reconstructs
[07:44:09] <gwern> so the lines 'migrate' towards a sharp arrangement
[07:44:53] <nshepperd2> btw that problem with non-sharp outputs is i think why i found that usually upscaling worked better if i downsampled the image to 1/2x first, then upscaled
[07:44:54] <gwern> I don't believe there's much in the way of cyclic noise in diffusion models at the moment, is there? it's always one-and-done, modulating noise up and down along the way for efficiency but nevertheless, just homing in on 1
[07:45:21] <nshepperd2> like, downsampling destroys/hides a bunch of the super high frequency artifacts like blurry lines
[07:45:42] <nshepperd2> so that the upscaler doesn't have to try reproduce them
[07:45:50] <gwern> I was thinking more that it leaves a 'weak' line in place, as a guiderail but each line can be shifted a little for better global consistency
[07:46:01] <gwern> so if you bounced in and out a few times, it could heavily revise on net
[07:46:21] <gwern> having a 'sketch' or seed image always worked pretty well for GAN-like archs
[07:46:41] <gwern> that was also one reason I suggested the multi-scale DALL-E

[07:54:56] <nshepperd2> hm what if i trained an upscaler using preds from another diffusion model as augmented inputs
[07:55:15] <nshepperd2> maybe bad but it should learn to fix up the kind of artifacts that diffusion outputs
[07:59:43] <PapuaHardyNet> it is so much more easy to understand things by reading andy matuschak's notes, than it is by reading the essay he wrote based on those notes

[22:14:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> The configuration was the big deal. Is the big deal. All this shit - any *nix system can do it. But configuring it is the problem.
[22:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Server.app solved it.
[22:15:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was brilliant, frankly.
[22:15:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> They used to distribute a whole separate version of the OS - Mac OS X Server
[22:16:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Indeed the first available versions of Mac OS X *were* the Server versions; I remember setting that up in my high school before regular Mac OS X even came out. It was Darwin-based when Mac OS was still Classic...)

[22:34:59] <ggreer> I know one nurse and one teacher who have done the same thing (tested positive and then gone out and lived their lives because... whatever)
[22:36:09] <ggreer> people have very different levels of risk tolerance and what they consider to be acceptable behavior. maybe he forged it. maybe he didn't. the important thing is that he sent his blood to be analyzed for antibodies and he had enough for australia to go "yeah you're fine"
[22:36:26] <kuudes> if it is his blood
[22:36:41] <ggreer> pretty easy to check. his blood would have white blood cells which have DNA
[22:36:54] <ggreer> compare it against a cheek sample
[22:37:00] <kuudes> is there a comparison sample?
[22:37:43] <kuudes> also, forged covid cert is a felony in many places, and many places have rules to forbid felons from entering the country

[22:38:22] <kuudes> he had an upcoming sentence from having smuggled drugs
[22:38:25] <ggreer> would they destroy the blood sample after testing? usually you use some to test and then you freeze rest in case you need to retest
[22:38:47] <kuudes> covid labs likely won't store anything
[22:38:57] <kuudes> but if there was some sort of vip procedure, maybe
[22:39:18] <ggreer> you could also draw blood again and test antibodies now
[22:39:41] <ggreer> oh and there are other things like hematocrit levels, blood type, etc. it'd be pretty risky to send someone else's blood
[22:39:54] <ggreer> because if they checked any of those, the jig would be up
[22:40:08] <kuudes> sportspeople have been caught on having other persons urine inside them to avoid doping exposure
[22:40:21] <ggreer> yeah but that's doping. everyone does that
[22:40:34] <kuudes> well it is a crime in many places
[22:40:42] <kuudes> ie not just against rules, but prisontime
[22:40:53] *** bildramer1 is now known as bildramer
[22:41:09] <ggreer> hence all the elite athletes in prison? come on. everyone dopes and almost everyone gets away with it
[22:41:20] <kuudes> no, not everyone dopes
[22:41:22] <ggreer> oh and urine doesn't have nearly as many markers that identify the person it came from
[22:41:56] <ggreer> trust me, they do. if you win a medal you are almost certainly doping. it's super easy to get away with
[22:43:14] <kuudes> we have different priors

[23:45:20] <ggreer> it seems like as long as you don't smoke meth or sit in the sun all day, it'd be mostly genetics
[23:46:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely
[23:46:59] <gwern> longevity is relatively unheritable, and appearance is a pretty good proxy

[23:50:08] <ggreer> I guess scott is skinnyfat then? his face is kinda doughy
[23:50:28] <kuudes> if the fatherhood is outside marriage, then if another man provides reasonable grounds, paternity can be challenged and investigated
[23:51:09] <kuudes> within marriage the spouses and the child can provide reasonable grounds for someone being or not being the father, but not outsiders
