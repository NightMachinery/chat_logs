[01:29:18] <ski> considering the third alternative, it is basically `User = Int * String * (1 + Int)'. if we ignore the (basically useless) `freeUserType' and `paidUserType' fields in the second alternative, then we can see that this alternative is what you get, when you distribute the multiplication over the sum, in the third one : `User = Int * String + Int * String * Int'
[01:32:19] <pareto-optimal-d> Updated the mistakes, thank you. 
[01:32:24] <ski> this whole thing is reminiscent of attempting to represent `Maybe T' by `Bool * T'. but with that representation, representing `Just t' as `(True,t)', you get useless "slack" when representing `Nothing' as `(False,t0)' for some faux `t0' value. you allow data in your representation that is useless, can be used by mistake, and may be hard to conjure up

[01:37:42] <ehammarstrom> I have just been introduced to fused-effects and written a small program that composes some effects, namely a logger (glorified putStrLn) and file reader (glorified ReadFile with errorhandling). What is good "effect" design? As I see it the vocabulary of an effect could be _really big_ (Database Effect perhaps) since it's like a DSL of sorts (?) Are there any texts or fun libraries using fused-effects that showcase 
[01:37:42] <ehammarstrom> a good practice/scope of an Effect?
[01:42:03] <pareto-optimal-d> Okay, thanks for your comments ski. I'm still mulling them over. If it helps the larger context that I had in mind here was how using database models as domain types can harm type safety.

[01:56:29] <jackdk> ehammarstrom: I'm not aware of anything specific but off the top of my head, I'd expect you'd want high-level effects determined by your domain: input this, output that, high-level ops against a datastore. interpret directly into IO, or perhaps an intermediate representation if you need to test at that layer: perhaps you interpret your datastore effect into either postgres or sqlite, and from tehre into IO
[01:57:09] <jackdk> The demo starting at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dHFOjcK6pA&t=240 may give a good flavour. It shows the effect-system dream, certainly

[04:29:52] <Me-me> Ah, okay, that's just saying how to do combinatorics. Sure.
[04:30:12] <pavonia> Haskell uses whitespace for separating arguments

[04:31:31] <pavonia> It's a single definition, but spilt into several cases
[04:31:44] <pavonia> Line 7 is the definition for k=0

[05:40:04] <int-e> FernandoChu[m]: If you have newtype Foo a = {-Foo-} a and f :: a -> Foo a; f x = id x, do you apply id to Foo x, or do you do Foo (id x)? Note that if you use a class member like `succ` then this will affect semantics.
[05:40:50] <int-e> "can be inferred" isn't really true when there's polymorphic types everywhere.

[18:16:37] <int-e> pavonia, Me-me: About https://paste.debian.net/1231570/ ... Well I'm more awake now, so I can try... So the problem is, there's a bag of marbles with 10 marbles of color 1, 20 marbles of color 2, etc., to 150 marbles of color 15. We select 10 of those marbles and want to know the probability that we get at least 6 colors, or, taken the complement, that we have at most 5 colors. Now if we focus on...
[18:16:43] <int-e> ...any l of the colors (a sublist of length l of ns) then there's a simple formula to count in how many ways we can use a subset of those marbles, that's line 18. However, that count includes cases with fewer than l colors, and if we simply added those up for all the 5-element lists we'd overcount. We need to compensate for that, using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (hence `pie`). The amount...
[18:16:49] <int-e> ...of overcounting that happens for sublists of length l is accounted in ws !! l. If we wanted to count the possibilities with *exactly* k colors, then we'd simply have  ws !! l = (-1)^(k-l) * c (n - l) (k - l), where the (-1)^(k-l) comes straight from the inclusion-exclusion principle, and c (n-l) (k-l) is the number of ways to extend an l-element subset of {1..n} to a k-element subset of...
[18:16:55] <int-e> ...{1..n}. But we want to count the number of ways to get at most k (== 5) colors, so we sum those terms for k' = 0..k, which becomes l..k because the expression is zero for 0..l-1 (and the implementation of `c` doesn't actually cope with those cases). [This is actually how the code evolved, so it explains the shadowing of k: overloading on the spot is less error-prone than adjusting the formula....
[18:17:01] <int-e> ...I'd change the variable name if I ever cleaned up the code.]

[19:11:57] <yrlnry> Hi folks.  I want to learn to use setrvant (https://github.com/haskell-servant/) .  It has a tutorial, and the tutorial has three sets of installation instructions, one each for cabal, stack, and nix, but none of them worked for me.

[19:12:44] <yrlnry> The cabal installation complains about an unmet dependency.  The stack installation tries to use HTP to retrieve something that replies 404.  And nix seems to work but the instructions are extremely incomplete and it doesn't say what to actually do.
[19:13:16] <yrlnry> The instructions here are https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/tutorial/install.html .  Does someone have time and interest to work through some of the problems with me?

[19:14:31] <geekosaur> you're having basically the same probloem with both cabal and stack: ubuntu ships ancient versions of everything

[19:15:23] <geekosaur> I suggest you remove the ubuntu packages and use ghcup to install newer versions

[22:03:51] <geekosaur> that, and arch is not the best distro to play with haskell stuff unless you're starting from ghcup instead of distro packages
[22:04:14] <geekosaur> they do really *annoying* things with their haskell packages
[22:05:54] <dvdrw> I think any install ought to go through ghcup/stack, it's much easier than whatever 'native' package manager solution you have in place
[22:05:58] <yrlnry> ghci now says that the kind of Functor is (* -> *) -> Constraint.  I expected just * -> *.   Has it changed?  What's "constraint"?
[22:06:13] <dvdrw> just like pip with python/nvm with node
[22:07:19] <dvdrw> yrlnry: There's been a fair few kind system tweaks over the years, the chronology of which I'm not so sure about. But there's now two kinds, * (or Type as it's now called) and Constraint
[22:07:19] <monochrom> If F is an instance of Functor, then F's kind is * -> *.  That doesn't mean Functor's kind is * -> *.
[22:07:20] <geekosaur> Functor is a typeclass, not a type constructor
[22:07:28] <dvdrw> Constraint is the typeclass kind
[22:07:34] <geekosaur> Constraint is something that appears to the left of =>
[22:08:15] <monochrom> Instead, given that "Functor F" is a constraint, therefore, Functor maps *->* to constraint.
