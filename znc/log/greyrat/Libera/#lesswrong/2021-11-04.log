[01:17:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously that sentence makes no sense, and SQUID — the Squid Game Token — did not always go up during its short life. Well, actually it did — “It surged more than 230,000% in the past week to $2,861.80,” says Bloomberg News — until its anonymous developers apparently stole all the money; then it went down. The whole thing is so stupid and overdetermined that I cannot bear to write about it; if you lost money on

[01:25:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> no?
[01:25:10] <feep> a bit of fuck
[01:25:17] <feep> less of a fuck than multirow tabs.
[01:25:31] <feep> let's say I was satisficed on security on firefox 76
[01:25:35] <galambo> feep, fwiw I enjoy using sidebery. it works with the latest firefox and it has lots of features
[01:25:43] <saturn2> you *can* make your own security sandbox for firefox
[01:25:45] <galambo> but its side tabs
[01:26:05] <feep> saturn2: oyeah, this also turns off addon security sandboxing XD
[01:26:09] <pompolic> "System1 now own Waterfox, but Alex Kontos is still leading the direction of Waterfox and will be for the foreseeable future." boo
[01:26:37] <saturn2> feep: i mean, it would have to
[01:26:42] <feep> I mean, see, the thing here is
[01:26:45] <feep> if you look at waterfox
[01:26:53] <feep> I'm genuinely not sure if I trust waterfox or tmp less
[01:27:02] <feep> I think probably waterfox?
[01:27:27] <feep> so addon signing off, weird github hack installed, and tmp on - is probably a trust *gain* for me
[01:27:42] <feep> since the only options under consideration are sensible browsers
[01:27:45] <feep> ie. browsers with multi-row tabs.
[01:28:11] <saturn2> but if you wanted both security and old extensions, technically you could make a bunch of separate browser profiles for different security contexts and run them in container jails or VMs
[01:28:12] <galambo> edge and vivaldi have side tabs
[01:28:22] <feep> saturn2: sure
[01:28:48] <feep> I was already satisficed on security though even before firefox started trading off features I used heavily for security.

[01:42:36] <galambo> I dont know / dont care for a few of these feeds
[01:43:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm sorry to hear about your poor taste in RSS feeds
[01:44:14] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, I have 1096 feeds in my reader
[01:44:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> That seems like a lot
[01:45:16] <energizer> how do you decide what to read galambo?
[01:45:44] <galambo> energizer, it depends on whether I like what I am reading
[01:46:01] <galambo> also I try to avoid feeds that post more than once a day
[01:46:07] <galambo> thats not what rss is for
[01:46:57] <energizer> i mean when you're looking at your reader and there's a thousand things there, how do you pick one?
[01:47:12] <galambo> energizer, I read everything

[01:48:17] <Robomot> Is this shit your job - Confused Black Man - quickmeme (Is this shit your job  Confused Black Man)
[01:51:08] <galambo> energizer, I group feeds by how frequently they post
[01:51:20] <galambo> so theres folder for feeds that post less than once a month
[01:52:09] <galambo> another one for feeds that post once a month, another for once a week, another for 2-6 times a week, another for 7 times a week
[01:52:42] <saturn2> hmm, leverage accounts anon never posted anything
[01:53:06] <saturn2> wonder what that means
[01:53:44] <galambo> and I adjust my reader so that I read all the entries posted by a feed before I move on to the next one. this way I can judge if the posts are still good enough and whether I should remain subscribed
[01:54:14] <galambo> to that particular feed
[01:54:20] <gwern> saturn2: that they tried to post and their bodies have been dumped into a shallow organic grave, perhaps
[01:55:09] <galambo> you guys should sign up for leveraged accounts. you will make a lot of money
[01:58:14] <rmmh> (or lose you a lot of money)
[01:58:24] <galambo> that too
[02:00:35] <galambo> are you guys buying anything on 11.11 or black friday?
[02:00:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sigh
[02:00:40] <rmmh> on October 29, 2021, a shipment of EVGA GeForce RTX 30-Series Graphics Cards was stolen from a truck en route from San Francisco to our Southern California distribution center.

[02:01:20] <galambo> guess its not gonna be graphics cards then

[02:08:41] <Robomot> The metaverse is bullshit | Hacker News
[02:09:08] <galambo> Im probably preaching to the choir because I am posting this on an irc channel
[02:10:36] <saturn2> it depends on what your goals are, obviously

[02:15:07] <spxtr> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29097669 this comment and children makes me immediately think that NYC is a garbage place to live if transportation is really this stressful
[02:15:08] <Robomot> As someone who both bikes and drives around Brooklyn, I would bet this is going ... | Hacker News
[02:15:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Huh? It's not stressful at all
[02:16:08] <Obormot\Gaia> NYC has the best public transport system in the country, by a *huge* margin
[02:16:18] <spxtr> yeah I suppose if that's all you take
[02:16:19] <Obormot\Gaia> "resurfaced roads that don't have lines painted on them for weeks or months" ... no
[02:16:23] <spxtr> biking and driving sound terrifying though
[02:16:34] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: Not even close to true, I drive here all the time, it's fine
[02:16:56] <spxtr> do you disagree with the commenter, then, that to drive there you gotta be a jerk and such?
[02:17:01] <Obormot\Gaia> Biking is definitely scary, which is good because fuck cyclists, they get in the way and are super, super annoying
[02:17:10] <Obormot\Gaia> I hate them as a driver and as a pedestrian
[02:17:20] <spxtr> I hate cars as both a cyclist and a pedestrian :P
[02:17:33] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: Yes that guy is full of shit
[02:17:41] <Obormot\Gaia> "resurfaced roads that don't have lines painted on them for weeks or months" no
[02:17:47] <Obormot\Gaia> "congested intersections where you'd probably need to wait 3 hours to pass through legally" no
[02:18:00] <spxtr> ok, that's good to know. although the one time I've been to boston I definitely thought I would probably die on the uber to/from the airport
[02:18:05] <Obormot\Gaia> "sometimes you need to do very human and assertive "negotiation" to get into the lane you need" or you could follow the rules of the road on how to merge
[02:18:42] <spxtr> "I'm generally a pretty slow and careful driver in other places, but having driven around NYC for many years now, I can say that it's basically necessary to be an extremely aggressive driver here. If you want to change lanes, you need to cut someone off. It's just expected."
[02:18:49] <Obormot\Gaia> "you can disrupt traffic flow quite badly if you e.g. don't pull up to the crosswalk, and out of the way of cars behind you" ... so, you can disrupt traffic flow is you do stupid shit? shocking, truly shocking
[02:18:55] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: no
[02:19:19] <spxtr> Obormot\Gaia: have you lived somewhere in the USA besides big NE cities?
[02:19:23] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: yes
[02:19:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Indianapolis
[02:19:37] <spxtr> guess I don't know how drivers are there
[02:19:47] <Obormot\Gaia> Dumb, just like everyone else
[02:20:05] <Obormot\Gaia> Also annoyingly friendly, just like etc.
[02:20:10] <Obormot\Gaia> Basically just the worst
[02:20:26] <Obormot\Gaia> Also the public transport is way, way, way worse
[02:20:37] <spxtr> yeah seems like nyc is the outlier for transit
[02:20:38] <Obormot\Gaia> Also the city is just lame and sucks and is dumb in general.
[02:20:40] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes
[02:21:34] <saturn2> "I'm generally a pretty slow and careful driver" i assume this means their reaction time is somewhere in the 5 second range
[02:21:38] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, if the NYC driving landscape somehow prevents Waymo from expanding into this great city, I will cheer
[02:21:41] <saturn2> no wonder they have problems
[02:21:44] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: Right, yeah
[02:22:21] <Obormot\Gaia> Definitely can't be sitting there pondering the meaning of life if you wanna drive in NYC
[02:23:03] <Obormot\Gaia> "There's unwritten rules about who you can cut off. My experience is from LA freeways, the rules may be different in NYC, but the concept is the same. Buses and other vehicles, usually no, but sometimes. Marked taxis, no. Older vehicle with lots of scrapes, probably no." ... bizarre. No such thing in NYC. Never heard of this concept in my 20 years driving here
[02:23:25] <spxtr> yeah that sounded wrong to me
[02:24:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Reading the comments more, I'll note that *Manhattan* in particular is a shitty place to drive, but mostly not because of any of these specific (and mostly nonsensical) complaints
[02:24:51] <Obormot\Gaia> It's just because there's too many cars for the available bandwidth, as it were
[02:25:10] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyone who lives here knows you don't drive into/in Manhattan unless you absolutely 100% must
[02:25:10] <spxtr> ah, that's an easy problem to fix: add more transit and more bike infrastructure :)
[02:25:30] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: No, you don't understand: there *already is* more than enough transit and bike infrastructure in Manhattan
[02:25:45] <Obormot\Gaia> There's very rarely any actual need to drive into that borough
[02:26:22] <spxtr> people do it anyways, eh?
[02:26:25] <Obormot\Gaia> There's buses on every major avenue and many cross streets. There's *massive* density of subway line coverage. There's those CityBikes or w/e they're called every-damn-where.
[02:27:12] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: Yes, though many of those "people" are taxis/Ubers/etc.
[02:27:21] <spxtr> I want to go visit the netherlands and denmark for some time to see if the transportation story there is as good as all those youtube channels assert it is
[02:27:52] <Obormot\Gaia> One of my most infuriating driving experiences was when I moved back from Indy to NYC and I had to return the rental car
[02:28:20] <Obormot\Gaia> The rental agency (I think it was Avis?) garage is in Manhattan... and the car was the Biggest SUV Ever
[02:28:27] <Obormot\Gaia> A Ford Expedition iirc
[02:28:43] <Obormot\Gaia> Driving that shit down tiny Manhattan streets was something else, let me tell you
[02:28:43] <spxtr> hah, I hate when I ask for a small car and they give me a big ole suv
[02:29:02] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:29:17] <saturn2> i imagine a lot of this comes from people who are accustomed to driving in suburbia where if there are 3 moving cars in your field of view it's heavy traffic
[02:29:19] <Obormot\Gaia> I mean, I needed the big rig, I had a lot of shit to transport, but... yeah, driving that into Manhattan was worse than the whole rest of the trip from Indy, lol
[02:29:21] <spxtr> recently I found myself in the middle of a large street race at 3 AM in tallahassee. felt very out of place in my chevy suv around all these tricked out racing cars
[02:30:57] <spxtr> turned out the race was in sight of my hotel room, so once I got off the rode and calmed down I got to watch fast and furious stuff going down in real life

[02:34:08] <Obormot\Gaia> I do like this response, though: "Because for New Yorkers, the light in the end of the tunnel is... New Jersey."
[02:34:24] <Obormot\Gaia> "You sound like a complete dick when you are behind the wheel. Please consider stopping driving. Your role as a driver isn't to correct other people's driving; it's to get you and your passengers somewhere safely, while keeping all other road users safe." ... INCORRECT
[02:34:36] <spxtr> "Why are you so angry?" "Presumably because they have to drive a car in downtown Brooklyn occasionally"

[02:53:07] <gwern> sadly, not really. once or twice I've recovered writing based on the screenshot. my original goal was to record ambient brightness with the webcam and I simply set up the screenshots as a one-liner to provide context, but I no longer have a laptop with a webcam, so...

Indeed, the more we explore the list of his ambiguous attributes, the
[03:18:31] <feepbot> more inescapable the comparison with Santa Claus becomes. Above all, the Easter bunny is the total opposite of Santa Claus, and it is in this opposition that we may find the key to the symbolic meaning of both.' <-- of course!

[09:04:46] <feep[work]> catern: the videogame Control is basically a triple-A SCP game.
[09:05:53] <feep[work]> its narrative centers on the fictional Federal Bureau of Control. Being an alternate-universe SCP foundation in all but name, the joke is that FBC stands for "Fecure, bontain, contain again" ("Secure, contain, protect" being the SCP motto.)

[10:36:12] <feep[work]> well, some people define "better person" as involving cat-ears and cuddles 
[10:36:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I can barely get myself to watch anime or read novels I want to read anymore, and after I do, I feel a sense of regret unless it was exceptionally meaningful to me
[10:36:56] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: sure, we all value different things, I'm not judging, and in fact, if I value SDr, then I value him valuing cat-ears and cuddles
[10:37:18] <feep[work]> um, from your description it kinda sounds like you should be hooked on more things

[10:37:41] <PapuaHardyNet> could you elaborate? I'm unsure what you mean
[10:37:55] <feep[work]> I don't want to call "depression" for normal changes in interests
[10:38:07] <feep[work]> especially since I too barely read books anymore and almost don't watch anime at all
[10:38:56] <feep[work]> but it sounds like you're ... unhappy with liking the things you like, and don't like the things you think you should like, and it might just be ending up with you not liking anything
[10:39:02] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, "value becoming someone I admire and respect"  yeah, backstory on that, is that I sorta maxed that out, hit a ceiling / sigmoid on this, then kinda realized, that 1, most of these evaluation criterias are mostly other people's way to manipulate you; and 2, the ones I have chosen for myself hit ceilings that are, empirically speaking,
[10:39:02] <SDr> very very difficult to hack through (at least for me)
[10:40:34] <SDr> and honestly, doing nothing , _but_ hacking_ for the past 16 years (jumping from hungary to london to san francisco poverty to san francisco business-owner) I'm kinda like "at this rate of energy expanditure, is the result really worth it"
[10:42:03] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: who do you admire and respect, and why?
[10:42:07] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: ehh, I do care about the work I do, I do appreciate the people I work with and talk to (#lesswrong is one example). I'd say I'm in a state of huge flux. But I don't think I'm going to mess up.
[10:42:34] <feep[work]> well, warning stated~
[10:44:32] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: you've just made me realize I don't unabashedly admire and respect anyone. It is all with qualifications, mainly because I've gotten to know the people I used to respect and admire
[10:45:17] <saturn2> that's probably healthy
[10:45:45] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern and nshepperd, I know them better now and I can clarify where I differ from them and mentally they seem like peers more than heroes (even though they are much much better than me at two things - their work and their social skills)

[10:46:11] <PapuaHardyNet> the third guy I admire and respected, well, he's the CEO of the company I work for. 
[10:47:01] <PapuaHardyNet> again, with more interaction with him, I can see he has flaws too, and see where we have value or philosophy conflicts, mainly because of our experience and histories differing

[10:52:04] <feep[work]> kuudes: that song is made to be simultaneously at the boundary for slowest and fastest possible perception of rhythm
[10:52:08] <feep[work]> that's why it has a 19/4 signature
[10:52:31] <PapuaHardyNet> to give people epilepsy?
[10:52:44] <feep[work]> well, mostly as a musical experiment I think
[10:52:58] <feep[work]> there's a good explanation of the logic behind it on youtube somewhere
[10:54:06] <PapuaHardyNet> all right!
[10:54:13] <feep[work]> but the idea is, the individual beats are right at the boundary of where you can tell beats apart
[10:54:41] <feep[work]> but the bar length is at the *upper* boundary of where it forms a recognizeable unit
[10:55:12] <feep[work]> (though in practice it seems to be coming out as 6+6+6+1)
[10:55:32] <kuudes> hmm. would epileptics also get epilepsy from actual wireheading, and if so, will they save humanity?
[10:56:26] <saturn2> i think this is the first song you've linked that i've liked

[12:48:15] <rsaarelm> A good prepper is a gray man, not a cyberpunk larper.
[12:48:16] <PapuaHardyNet> techwear goes balls deep into artificial material, while preppers usually prefer more natural material (including leather) because of a tinge of Luddism

[12:53:27] <PapuaHardyNet> you wear such clothing *when* you know you won't need to run
[12:54:03] <PapuaHardyNet> this means blue-collar workers don't wear this, and of course, you don't wear this to the gym.
[12:54:23] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, this is just style generalities, not specific to techwear
[12:57:15] <saturn2> i hate it when skinny pants are in style, legs are hideous, you should hide that shit under baggy fabric
[12:59:43] <PapuaHardyNet> do you mean muscular legs are hideous? women's legs are incredibly aesthetically pleasing imo
[13:05:44] <saturn2> i don't think muscular people can wear pants like the ones in that goth techwear picture

The same thing occurred to me, especially as I looked at the messed-up page width of the website in my current FF Mac. First, backwards compatibility: I just opened the PDF of the paper he mentions on Acrobate Reader 5.0 on Mac OS 9 (a system now old enough to drink). Worked flawlessly. THe website... well, I didn't bother
[16:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus>  trying it on a Classic Mac OS system, that's obviously gonna fail, but how about at least TenFourFox? How broken will it be? It turns out that the answer is: On TenFourFox, the website is a completely fucking blank page, with the JS console saying "SyntaxError: missing = in constant declaration". gg.

[16:51:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> “On the SIGPLAN blog, Greenberg [2021] argued for a new PL journal motivated by these challenges: to make PL research more accessible. Greenberg cited Distill as a primary inspiration for similar efforts in machine learning research. However, only three months after Greenberg's post, the Distill editors announced a potentially indefinite hiatus [Team 2021]. A key reason was:
[16:51:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> > "We believed that many valuable scientific contributions—such as explanations, interactive articles, and visualizations—were held back by not being seen as real scientific publications. Our theory was that if a journal were to publish such artifacts, it would allow authors to benefit from the traditional academic incentive system and enable more of this kind of work. After four years, we no longer believe this theory of
[16:51:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  impact. [...] Instead, we believe the primary bottleneck is the amount of effort it takes to produce these articles and the unusual combination of scientific and design expertise required."”
[16:51:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're not wrong... but I could've told them that
[16:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Every time someone publishes a cool demo like this, there's a flood of people saying "wow, everyone should do this sort of thing!"
[16:53:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah? Everyone? You gonna do it, random twitter admirer? You gonna put in the amount of effort it takes? No. You're not, and neither will anyone else

[16:57:00] * Obormot\Arcturus keeps reading
[16:59:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> So one of the Nota "core principles" is: "A static display is preferable to an interactive one, all else being equal." Fair enough, but I wonder exactly in what cases all else is supposed to *not* be equal

[20:11:25] <gwern> use of latex fragments like \letprov doesn't seem too bad. 'inline' tex like 'a + x^{20}' isn't too bad. the nightmare comes in dealing with more complex stuff

[20:13:29] <gwern> that's nice. copy-paste listener maps it back I assume

[22:38:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough
[22:39:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah that's definitely 100% the answer
[22:39:18] <mst> also, it always seemed to me that the main issue was a southern US wall was simply impractical to do right due to distance, terrain, and the fact there's a shitload of e.g. farms that are part on each side, so even the existing segments have tractor-sized gates in them
[22:39:38] <mst> plus the fact that a static barrier only slows people down if you don't have personnel paying attention
[22:40:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: "distance" and "terrain" and "gotta have personnel" are all surmountable barriers, though
[22:40:24] <mst> I mean, there's a reason the border hawks who actually cared about enforcement wanted more funding but to spend it on not-wall things (including personnel for existing barrier segments)
[22:40:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I gotta assume the "farms across the border" thing also is (and how big of a problem is it really?)
[22:40:50] <mst> 'build the wall' was something bannon and roger stone invented because they couldn't get trump to stay on topic about immigration so they needed something pithy that he could actually remember
[22:41:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yeah, I mean, again, the obvious answer is "no reason except incompetence of implementation", but the implied point made by the rhetorical question is that the people who were all like "a wall cannot possibly work, in principle, ever" were full of shit
[22:41:30] <gwern> farms across an international border? that's the farms' problem. they knew what they were building
[22:41:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that too
[22:42:19] <ggreer> it wasn't that long ago that you could cross the border in either direction with no paperwork or stopping

[22:42:42] <gwern> it's not like international borders are a thing you just kinda miss. 'what, my farm stretches 10 miles into mexico??? I had no idea. what is this mexico thing? isn't that like a us state or something? why didn't the property registrar or real estate agent mention this?'

[22:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Anyway, back to the "support for taking migrants in Eastern Europe" thing: I think the more comprehensive / fundamental answer is something like: "The *default* position is 'no, of course we won't let arbitrary poor foreigners settle in our country; you've got to be either an idiot or a (particularly shameless) foreign subversive for even suggesting such a *blatantly obviously* destructive policy', because doing anything
[22:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  like this is just not even remotely in the interest of a sovereign nation. Therefore what needs to be explained isn't 'why didn't Hungarians support taking migrants', but rather 'why *did* Westerners support taking migrants'" - and then the answer to *that* is "progressive ideology" and so on

[22:49:51] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: it was sufficiently obvious to me that neither the funding nor the competence was there to move the needle meaningfully so I didn't bother checking for 'quantity of low-hanging fruit' since it didn't seem like it'd meaningfully affect the outcome either way

[22:51:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shouldn't we at least *check* how Hungary is doing, like, economically? And stuff?
[22:51:53] <mst> then again, my personal belief is that given large sectors of the US are currently dependent on illegal labour and no politician wants to admit that out loud and propose a solution to it, the odds of anything meaningful happening in terms of immigration enforcement are inevitably minimal because there's too much money and power arrayed against doing so if there's not a replacement for the workers on the

[23:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And more than the other two, Orban seems to play into American fears of dictatorship. His policies are the ones we’re afraid of happening here.

[23:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I don't really see how Orban qualifies as a dictator. Even with the absurdly gerrymandered electoral system and the corrupt influence buying, Hungary is still a democracy and Orban is still a democratically elected head of state. To my mind, the line separating democracies from dictatorships is whether or not a majority of the people can vote out the party/leader in power, and whether or not people can openly campaign against
[23:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  the party/leader in power without being arrested or murdered. Both things are still pretty clearly true in Hungary. If Orban were to rig an election or violently repress his opposition, he would hop right over that line, but I don't think even his harshest critics have claimed that he's done that yet. " ... he's not even violently repressing anyone?!

[23:28:16] <SDr> | I wrote a long thread on QuantMar, which is this stack exchange site that I operate. I found this video from, I don’t know, six, seven years ago from one of Facebook’s ad auction economists and he was giving a presentation at UC Berkeley to some grad students and it was on some grainy cam and I don’t know that it was meant to be seen by a
[23:28:16] <SDr> lot of people, but he just walks through the whole logic of the auction algorithm, it’s really, really interesting.
[23:28:16] <SDr> The way they operate that calculus of deciding which ad to show you is an impression pops up in your feed and they have a whole universe of things that they could potentially fill that with. That pertains to content, so like stuff that your mom shared or whatever, but also some of those units are dedicated to ads, some proportion. The way that they
[23:28:16] <SDr> decide what to fill into that space, onto that canvas, is they take this whole set of content options, whether it’s content or an ad and they look at your profile and your history of clicking on stuff and they say, “What’s the probability that this person’s going to click on this thing?” Then they multiply that times the expected value of
[23:28:16] <SDr> you going to do that thing and so if it’s content it’s “Are they likely to engage with this? Are they likely to leave a comment? Are they likely to like it?” Engage with it in some way beyond just scrolling past it. If it’s an ad, “How likely are they to click on it? What’s the expected value of their participation in that product?
[23:28:16] <SDr> Are they likely to make a purchase? Are they likely to put something in a cart? Are they likely to complete a level in a mobile game? What’s the expected value of that?” And then they use that expected value, they moderate it by the click probability and that’s how they rank them, that’s how the whole bid mechanism works.
[23:28:44] <SDr> (from Stratchery, about FB's feed algo)
[23:29:17] <SDr> so, aha! it's not actually engagement-maximizing, it's expected-value maximizing algo, where "engaging content" has expected value of longer time-on-platform, or stg

It’s just beginning to hit for me. I’ll be 47 this month, and some of my classmates from college are about to send their eldest kids off to college. Some will become empty-nesters. Others have more kids to launch. The
[23:44:19] <feepbot> true divergence of life paths becomes evident with adult children around I think. This is a ghost protocol because once you’re past the divergence point, you realize children are how societies measure the stake older adults have in futures they will not live to see. They are how societies can trust the participation of older adults in any collective decisions with consequences
[23:44:19] <feepbot> that extend past their own lives. Children are the default form of skin in the game of civilization. To be voluntarily childless is to have no legible stake in the future that society can see. This means you’re untrustworthy until you prove yourself trustworthy (ideally through a child-focused behavior such as being a good aunt or uncle, or a caring teacher or mentor). Certain
[23:44:24] <feepbot> classes of voluntarily childless types, such as celibate monks and nuns, are granted exemptions from being ghosted. The rest must prove they can be trusted around long-term decisions.
