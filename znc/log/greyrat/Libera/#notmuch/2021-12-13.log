[13:38:57] <jani> has there been some change in the emacs thread indentation code recently?
[13:41:13] <jani> looks like spaces are being added after tabs in the middle of the line to achieve indentation
[13:42:10] <jani> so if you have a line that starts with "<tab><tab>foo" it's being indented as "<tab><tab><spc>foo"
[13:43:59] <jani> I'm sure it's fine for a lot of things, but looking at emailed patches, it's awful. context lines get the above treatment, but actual +/- lines don't because they don't have leading tabs, and the indentation does not line up
[14:01:10] <jani> can't find anything in either notmuch or emacs git blame, I wonder if my config changed somehow when I switched machines
[14:30:49] <bremner> jani: I don't _think_ so. Did you do upgrade emacs or some other emacs addons?
[14:30:56] <bremner> s/do//
[14:33:01] <jani> bremner: yeah, to 27
[14:33:15] <jani> (and yes, I was on 26 way too long...)
[14:33:42] <bremner> hmm. So I'm running 27, maybe I'm just used to whatever is going on. Can you point me to a patch on the notmuch list where this is clear?
[14:35:24] <bremner> usually I hate screen shots, but this might be a good use case...
[14:40:48] <jani> bremner: I was trying to look, but I think this particular problem is more pronounced in projects that don't use spaces for indentation
[14:42:10] <jani> bremner: here's a non-notmuch list mail https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211210232404.4098157-2-ira.weiny@intel.com
[14:43:18] <jani> on the browser, and in un-indented notmuch-show mode, the context and the changes line up nicely because of the tabs used for indentation
[14:44:43] <jani> it gets indented in notmuch-show because it's in-reply-to the cover letter, and a space gets inserted after the tabs in the context line
[14:45:05] <bremner> hmm. OK. can I have the raw message somehow?
[14:45:42] <jani> just add /raw at the end, https://lore.kernel.org/all/20211210232404.4098157-2-ira.weiny@intel.com/raw
[14:45:47] <jani> there's a button there somewhere too
[14:45:59] <jani> you'll need the cover letter too, obviously
[14:47:15] <jani> but honestly I couldn't find relevant changes in either notmuch or emacs source for this, and I got this uneasy feeling nothing changed except my perception :o
[14:49:20] <bremner> meh, the "raw" files don't parse as mail in notmuch.
[14:49:26] <jani> :(
[14:49:47] <bremner> maybe becasue the From: is part of the message body?

[14:50:45] <bremner> nope. Dunno. If you forward me a thread I'll play with it a bit.
[15:02:27] <jani> bremner: sent, thanks
[15:05:41] <jani> maybe it's like the old trinitron wire shadows. if you don't see them, you're fine, but if you see them, you can't unsee them :p
[15:06:14] <bremner> sometimes things turn out to be gnus bugs, and larsi fixes them.
[15:28:55] <bremner> jani: I can reproduce the issue, so I guess that's good news?
[15:37:52] <bremner> jani: seems to be a stock behaviour of indent-rigidly. Maybe we should not use it? Or maybe it can be tricked into being less "smart"

[16:54:41] <jani> bremner: idk, maybe it's a good feature for non-patch emails?
[16:55:29] <bremner> jani: yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe untabify before indent just for patches would be a better solution?
[16:55:43] <bremner> some kind of "wash" function...
