[18:23:18] <jpb> DarthGandalf: some of the thing about setting up certificates.
[18:23:51] <jpb> i'll have to do this from memory because i cant run a test environment right now to verify
[18:24:38] <jpb> so a bit of background first.
[18:25:15] <jpb> i initially setup the first user as znc.  this user has admin rights but does not participate in any network.
[18:26:45] <jpb> i then set up a user (jpb) and followed the website  instructions for creating a client certificate.  i also uploaded the certificate and put it into the network and user areas of the data directory (again following the website instructions)
[18:28:07] <jpb> however when i then  accessed the webadmin portal (as admin znc) i could  not seem to get any certificate loaded
[18:29:05] <jpb> there is a screen that has a text box, that looks like it wants me to copy and paste a pem file, but no instructions
[18:30:09] <jpb> there is also another screen that has a field (one line text box) for a "key", but no description of what the key is or where to find it.
[18:32:33] <jpb> also, in the edit user function, the text states "To connect to this network from your IRC client, you can set the server password field as jpb/LiberaChat:<password> or username field as jpb/LiberaChat"

[18:36:08] <jpb> this seems to imply that i should put my irc nick (jpb) password in the Password field of the "Servers of this IRC network:" in the list of irc networks in the "Network Info" section of that page
[18:36:23] *** Guest8357 is now known as zsoltiv_
[18:36:58] <jpb> but it could also mean to put my irc nick password in the Server field on my irc client (hexchat).
[18:37:26] <jpb> neither of those makes sense to me as libera chat needs no password to connect.
[18:39:03] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[18:40:23] <jpb> so, i've given up on certificates at the moment.  i was also hoping to use sasl for authentication, but i've just gone back to basic vanilla connection and authentication
[18:42:24] <jpb> happy to discuss / try again.
[18:44:09] <jpb> btw - this is not to disparage a good project.  i like the functionality and capabilities znc offers.   i'm hoping to get all this squared away and be "just another satisfied customer"

[18:46:11] <jaggz> how do I figure this out.. I have my jabot nick linked to this jaggz one

[18:46:52] <jaggz> when I try to connect, in its znc account, to libera, it says
[18:46:53] <jaggz> <*sasl> Disabling network, we require authentication.
[18:46:53] <jaggz> <*sasl> Use 'RequireAuth no' to disable.
[18:56:16] <DarthGandalf> jpb: you need sasl module to use sasl
[18:57:15] <jaggz> i have it enabled
[18:57:28] <jaggz> i'm also using it with the jaggz account already
[18:57:57] <jaggz> maybe the jabot nick has its own password and somehow I wiped that out.. I noticed it was empty in the libera irc server config in that account in znc
[18:58:02] <jaggz> not sure how it could have been wiped
[18:58:12] <jaggz> so I set it to the same pw as jaggz

[19:02:36] <Khaytsus> You sure the jabot thing is using SSL?  I assume SSL is required for SASL but I'm not 100% sure there
[19:02:42] <jaggz> it looks like it just uses the jaggz acct / pw

[19:05:47] <jaggz> Khaytsus, why?
[19:06:14] <jaggz> (btw, I found the problem.. I sometime reset my jaggz pw and didn't set that in sasl module for jabot)
[19:06:25] <Khaytsus> Because all the reasons.  Plus afaik it's network policy.
[19:06:49] <Khaytsus> Unless you're using your bot in your own personal channel, probably nobody cares
[19:07:00] <Khaytsus> If it's in other channels you don't control you'd certainly want it on itw own account
[19:08:48] <jaggz> I don't know any reasons

[19:09:21] <jaggz> if you /whois jabot it shows jaggz there yeah?

[19:10:04] <DarthGandalf> Khaytsus: I didn't hear of such policy
[19:10:47] <DarthGandalf> They ask the non-project bots to have cloak though which link to the the username
[19:11:09] <DarthGandalf> like unaffiliated/<foo>/bot/<bar>
[19:11:14] <DarthGandalf> at least it was like this before
[19:11:40] <DarthGandalf> I assumed it's still the same except for s/unaffiliated/user/
[19:12:34] <jaggz> since i just talked about it again in #libera, either no op is around, or the others there didn't find anything wrong with it
[19:12:38] <jaggz> I think we're good to go :)
[19:12:53] <Khaytsus> DarthGandalf: yes, but that requires a different account to have a different cloak ;)
[19:12:54] <jaggz> doh!  someone just said: @<A_Dragon> I highly suggest using separate accounts for bots and users
[19:13:20] <DarthGandalf> highly suggest sounds correct
[19:13:29] <Khaytsus> Yes, like I said before
[19:13:36] <DarthGandalf> Khaytsus: is it a policy though?
[19:13:37] <Khaytsus> If uising it in your own private channel, likely doesn't matter..
[19:13:47] <Khaytsus> I can't speak for policy, I suggested asking staff

[19:33:07] <jaggz> especially with those obnoxious caps in its nick
[19:33:42] <jaggz> it's pretty handy for my own use though; it has a semi-smart webpage summarizer
[19:33:46] <Khaytsus> Yeah, no, you won't
[19:34:10] <jaggz> so charming
[19:34:19] <Khaytsus> I loathe 99% of boats
[19:34:22] <Khaytsus> bots
[19:34:25] <Khaytsus> Noise...  just noise
[19:34:57] <Khaytsus> 15 people asking a bot in a public channel for their weather in a row..  grrrrrrrr
[19:35:06] <JaBot> May you drown in boat loathing!
[19:35:34] <JaBot> lol, Khaytsus .. mine had weather, but only for my wife and I on my own lan-irc server
[19:36:03] <JaBot> also, I *thought* translation would be nice, for some channels where periodic non-native speakers needed help
[19:36:14] <JaBot> was just too irritating.. and I also didn't feel like coding in the flood protection
[19:36:33] <JaBot> !trans
[19:36:33] <JaBot> Usage: !trans {nick} {lang_src} {lang_dst}  or  !trans {nick} to disable
[19:36:43] <Khaytsus> I did that sort of thing 20 years ago too but..  yeah no can you play with that somewhere else
[19:36:56] <JaBot> you could also enable it on any nick, and since it wasn't so useful, I didn't go through the trouble of restricting.. anything else either.
[19:37:14] <JaBot> good reminder. no time for play.
[19:37:27] <JaBot> gotta either sleep or work on heart monitor sensor code

[21:58:02] <ingo> Hello. Is there a way to make ZNC delay joining channels until the nickserv module has authorised the user successfully?
[22:03:42] <DarthGandalf> ingo: [[sasl]]
[22:03:42] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[22:04:07] <ingo> I'm asking for servers that don't support SASL
[22:04:19] <ingo> is that a no?
[22:09:12] <Ramses> uhm, you can set join time at user for channels
[22:09:32] <Ramses> set like 3 seconds, it should do the works
[22:10:07] <qwerty> check out a module called [[perform]] and use wait 
[22:10:07] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/perform
[22:10:25] <Ramses> so server connects, sends nickserv, then joins channels
[22:10:31] <Ramses> or that ^
[22:11:36] <ingo> Super! Thank you both.
[22:12:29] <Ramses> mine us under the network then the line is "Channel join delay:"
[22:13:37] <Ramses> perhaps that is on channel then the next after 3 seconds, but i think i managed to have it working somewhere
[22:13:48] <Ramses> s/one/on
[22:15:11] <Ramses> yw
[22:16:47] <qwerty> good luck
[22:16:48] <ingo> the help when I hover the field is worded such "Defines the delay in seconds, until channels are joined after getting connected."
[22:17:02] <ingo> so it seems this is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks again.
[22:17:20] <ingo> I've also just tested it and it works perfectly.
[22:18:17] <ingo> I will have to test whether flood protection must be enabled for it to work though.
[22:19:06] <ingo> Ideally I could disable flood protection and keep the join delay, but I could also achieve this by setting sufficiently high throttle numbers, presumably.
[22:20:19] <Ramses> yup, test away
[22:20:35] <ingo> Ok, I tested. The delay works with flood protection disabled. Perfecto!
[22:20:46] <Ramses> \o/
