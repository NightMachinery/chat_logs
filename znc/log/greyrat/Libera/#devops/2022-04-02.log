[00:00:51] <lantech19446> I'm trying to not be too hard on myself for this because merck pharmaceutical got hit by ransomware last year and those guys are high end IS with federal regulations and unlimited budgets if it can happen to them what chance do I stand but I know i can always do better and if i want to be in devops i always need to step back and say what did i do well what could i have improved
[00:02:44] <rawtaz> noone is safe
[00:04:19] <lantech19446> i'm glad i told you guys and not #reddit-sysadmin
[00:05:21] <rawtaz> lol
[00:05:51] <rawtaz> oh man, i saw a post on reddit today.. it was like "i have two friends who are starting to learn to get into devops. they know nothing about IT currently"
[00:06:14] <rawtaz> thats quite enraging. people should NOT try to become devops muppets when they dont know jack shit. that is nothing short of respectless
[00:06:38] <lantech19446> it's a buzzword they don't understand how much they need to understand to do it
[00:06:53] <rawtaz> its people like that which makes the work harder for the rest of us
[00:09:50] <lantech19446> there are days where I don't even feel like I should be doing it and a lot of the time it's because of people like the ones in #r-s who think they know everything
[00:11:04] <rawtaz> sure. disregard that.
[00:12:12] <lantech19446> it's hard sometimes
[00:12:24] <lantech19446> like i'm sure if i told them what happened i'd get raked over the coals
[00:12:47] <rawtaz> who cares. you dont have to give a shit about what they think
[00:13:13] <lantech19446> easier said than done sometimes
[00:13:21] <rawtaz> sure
[00:13:28] <rawtaz> but its still the only thing you have to do :D
[00:13:41] <lantech19446> brb i'm gonna start reimaging the circ computers if i can
[00:25:04] <lantech19446> no can do
[00:27:28] <rawtaz> nope.
[00:27:42] <lantech19446> i did this in such a fucked way because i combined two methods of restore inadvertently I could have had this up and running already if i hadn't done that
[00:40:33] *** Quits: Windy (~windy@user/windy) (Quit: stay fresh cheese bags)
[00:46:17] <lantech19446> I need to find a way to make this backup much smaller 437 gigs takes too long
[00:46:44] <rawtaz> mayeb you need a better backup software lol
[00:46:52] <rawtaz> 437 GB shouldnt take very long
[00:47:08] <lantech19446> right now it's not the backup software anymore i'm suffering with my own stupidity
[00:50:13] <rawtaz> dude, stop talking down on yourself, it's honestly getting a bit tiring :P
[00:50:18] <lantech19446> i planned on restoring this as a physical disk to a vm because of the way i backed it up in the first place but i couldn't do that and restore it to a different computer so it got all bungled up and now i'm copying it to another station where hyper-v is already installed and configured
[00:50:27] <rawtaz> stop feeling sorry about your own capabilities, focus on something more relevant ;)
[00:50:42] <rawtaz> noone is saying youre stupid, its only you
[00:51:02] <rawtaz> sounds good
[00:51:09] <lantech19446> sometimes you take credit where credit is due I just didn't think it through lol
[00:51:36] <lantech19446> all in all today is still a win but i'm allowed to have stupid moments lol
[00:52:31] <rawtaz> sure, like everyone else
[00:53:22] <lantech19446> ya know what i really wish i could do is build my domain controller on linux, not one of our linux boxes got taken out by this shit
[00:53:54] <rawtaz> hm reminds me theres patches for zlib out now... gotta intall them ASAP
[00:56:51] <lantech19446> fortunately i've been staying on top of all that stuff now that i have ansible
[00:57:24] <rawtaz> by having ansible run system updates?
[00:57:32] <lantech19446> yep
[00:58:28] <rawtaz> hm doesnt seem theres an actual RCE in that CVE yet
[01:01:26] <lantech19446> oi
[01:01:44] <lantech19446> 14 minutes and i should be able to boot up the restore and get on with the show
[01:03:09] <lantech19446> I wrote a journal entry about today and reminded myself not to be so tough on myself, don't know how much good it will do but i try to go back and reread the things i write a few times
[01:14:12] <lantech19446> 12 shots of espresso today and i'm still tired but at least the migraine is gone
[01:14:19] <slaughter> Jesus fuck
[01:14:25] <slaughter> 12 shots of espresso and I'd be on my ass
[01:14:28] <slaughter> Spasming
[01:14:51] <lantech19446> lol i get americano's so it's 6 shots diluted in hot water it's not like i'm drinking 12 shots straight
[01:15:33] <lantech19446> but yesterday I called out of work because i had a migraine for a 2nd day and was throwing up and shitting all over and i couldn't sleep at all for 2 days
[01:16:14] <lantech19446> see what happens when i take the day off lol
[01:16:14] <slaughter> Oh damn man :(
[01:16:16] <slaughter> That's no good
[01:16:45] <lantech19446> yea i normally don't get classical migraines but this fuckin sucked
[01:16:59] <lantech19446> woohoo less than a minute to go
[01:17:10] <lantech19446> if this fails at the last gig i'm quitting my job
[01:17:56] <lantech19446> oh thank god my job is safe
[01:19:50] <slaughter> lmao
[01:20:11] <lantech19446> it's not booting
[01:21:03] <slaughter> Shoot it 
[01:21:08] <slaughter> Then shoot it again to be sure
[01:21:29] <lantech19446> i know what the issue is but i need to attack is differently
[01:50:17] <lantech19446> ok new restore running, not quite the way i wanted to do it but it should work
[01:52:33] <lantech19446> or the stupid restore could error out and "not find the file"
[01:55:08] <slaughter> What shenanigans are you up to
[01:58:13] <lantech19446> trying to restore directly to the server but it's not finding the file it needs to load the restore. I'm about to have a panic attack i'm running out of time
[01:59:39] <lantech19446> i've gotta get this stupid thing restored somewhere
[02:00:20] <lantech19446> I'm gonna have to do it the same stupid way I did it before but with all the partitions and that took a couple hours
[02:03:32] <lantech19446> ok i have other problems gotta figure this out now because this is doing the same thing
[02:08:40] <slaughter> What kind of server is this? 
[02:09:20] <slaughter> Also, required and customary "have u herd of docker" :p
[02:12:06] <lantech19446> it's a dell poweredge and yes i'm learning it right now but i'm not that far along yet
[02:12:46] <lantech19446> this makes no sense I can sync the repository and it updates 15 files but it doesn't pull them for the restore
[02:12:53] <slaughter> I mean what kinda weird shit is this server running
[02:14:35] <lantech19446> it's nothing weird I think i just did things in a weird way because i didn't realize they were weird
[02:16:00] <lantech19446> i'm having so many issues with this because it's insisting on it being an mbr structure
[02:20:46] <slaughter> You make me so glad I don't manage physical infra

[02:22:22] <lantech19446> this makes no damn sense why the file is there but this won't see it anymore
[02:23:52] <lantech19446> ok i've literally given everyone full control over every folder in the backup and it still only sees one file
[02:25:25] <kubblai> you might need to take ownership of the files?
[02:25:44] <lantech19446> i just chowned every last one of em on the nas
[02:26:02] <lantech19446> still only seeing one file
[02:27:14] <kubblai> are you connecting over iscsi, fibre, or smb ?
[02:27:23] <lantech19446> smb
[02:27:35] <lantech19446> i just added all the permissions via map on the local server too
[02:27:48] <lantech19446> still no difference
[02:28:08] <kubblai> can you touch a file from the dell onto the nas mount point ?
[02:28:43] <lantech19446> right now i'm back to trying to do it the other way with restoring to a vm because i couldn't get the dell to format correctly
[02:29:53] <kubblai> im guessing if you reboot the dell it'll probably see whats in the mount
[02:30:03] <lantech19446> tried it
[02:30:24] <kubblai> are the files marked as hidden or something ?
[02:31:29] <kubblai> i would chown -R 777 on the nas share windows doesn't really play nice with unix permissions
[02:34:55] <lantech19446> i'll try that next, I just tried to do a file level restore for the two vhdx to see what that does, obviously gonna take some time to finish but i can live with it that way for the moment
[02:37:10] <kubblai> sorry that was chmod -R 777
[02:37:17] <lantech19446> i'm losing hope of getting up and running by tonight
[02:37:29] <lantech19446> that's ok I knew what you meant
[02:37:39] <kubblai> you'll probably want to chown it to the user the smb share is access with
[02:37:45] <lantech19446> already done
[02:41:36] <lantech19446> even that only see 1 17kb file
[02:41:55] <lantech19446> and i'm almost certain the file it's seeing is the test file to determine if it has permissions to the share
[02:47:28] <lantech19446> i don't understand this at all why will these vhdx not run
[02:51:08] <lantech19446> omg the website is starting
[02:53:23] <lantech19446> holy crap i might have actually done it
[02:56:11] <lantech19446> omg it's booted
[02:56:34] <lantech19446> all i gotta do now is work out the virtual routing
[02:58:52] <lantech19446> the best part to all of this is that none of the files are encrypted lol
[02:58:56] <slaughter> Oh man we're seriously considering running Postgres on EC2 instead of using RDS
[02:59:01] <slaughter> So exciting and yet so scary
[03:03:33] <lantech19446> sounds like a heap of fun
[03:04:20] <lantech19446> ok so dns resolves correctly, I can ping the website why the heck will the website not load
[03:10:46] <lantech19446> https isn't working oh well much worse shit could be happening
[03:12:34] <slaughter> Security is lame anyway

[03:28:11] <slaughter> Lol no problem! Now, you help me figure out this Aurora Serverless scaling issue and we're even
[03:29:04] <lantech19446> I don't even know what that is but what's the issue?
[03:29:49] <lantech19446> my boss just told me i did a good job, i'm not even getting blamed for it happening in the first place
[03:32:47] <slaughter> Oh we have some batch loading that's eating up our entire cluster, and our RDS bill could pay for several family's entire household expenses. Problem really seems to be inefficient queries that might or might not be related to the fact that Aurora Serverless _kinda_ sucks
[03:33:29] <lantech19446> I'm not familiar with aurora, what makes it suck other than inefficiency?
[03:37:41] *** Joins: _0x00 (~0x00@user/0x00/x-6246543)
[03:40:40] <slaughter> Well, connection limits are a problem in this case
[03:41:13] <slaughter> Scaling can be annoying - like many things in AWS, auto-scaling is a moot point for many use cases
[03:41:21] <slaughter> And it's fking expensive 
[03:42:08] <slaughter> In small/predicable workloads it's actually pretty legit
[03:42:17] <slaughter> Can save you a ton of money and time and give you flexibility
[03:42:38] <lantech19446> o ok
[03:43:22] <slaughter> Also - again, like most AWS things - scaling is a unit and CPU + RAM are tied to that. You can't scale your CPU independent of your RAM and vice versa
[03:43:42] <slaughter> So you can have situations where you're scaling all the way up for CPU intensive tasks and end up using 1% of your RAM
[03:44:04] <slaughter> Which, when you're paying what it costs for that scaling, is just a bit of a twist of the knife
[03:44:08] <lantech19446> ok
[03:44:19] <lantech19446> and I assume all the cloud solutions work that way?
[03:44:30] <slaughter> Most things yeah
[03:45:18] <slaughter> But with EC2-backed RDS you get at least some choice on CPU vs RAM, so you can scale what you need instead of paying for both unnecesarily
[03:45:50] <slaughter> But then in that case you're totally in charge of scaling - including availability during scaling operations etc
[03:47:58] <lantech19446> oh nice
[03:50:45] <slaughter> Nice until it's a production database and you need to scale twice a day
[03:50:49] <slaughter> How do?

[03:53:45] <lantech19446> k3s

[04:55:38] <lantech19446> you guys made me realize today that even though I feel really incompetent sometimes, when shit gets real i've come through and proved myself. I feel good about myself today
[04:58:42] <lantech19446> guess you left at this point, work is probably over for the day
[05:02:34] <slaughter> lantech19446 https not working on the whole network or just one machine?
[05:03:00] <lantech19446> whole network, it's not routing it but I may have figured it out
[05:03:39] <slaughter> I was going to guess CA or something but TBH you're talking hardware and that's not my game baby
[05:03:42] <lantech19446> tomorrow is another day my brain is spinning too much to worry about it right now all I know is I kicked ass today I got 98% of the network back up and fully functional in less than a day from a ransomware attack I feel good

[05:04:04] <slaughter> Ransomware? Recovery in less than a day?
