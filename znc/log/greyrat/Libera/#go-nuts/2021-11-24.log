[03:04:07] <j416> fizzie: is that not what stdlib already does?
[03:04:59] <fizzie> No, "encoding/json" does reflection at runtime to look at what you're unmarshalling to.
[03:05:22] <j416> fizzie: referring to https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Decoder.Token
[03:05:46] <j416> (as linked above)
[03:05:57] <fizzie> Well, that's again different, that's just an API for getting the low-level JSON tokens.
[03:06:24] <fizzie> I was referring to automatically generating a dedicated unmarshaller for each struct type at build time, so that no reflection is needed, but you don't have to manually write those functions either.

[03:59:00] <rawtaz> oh my, just noticed that the Go docs use the term "layout" instead of "format" for the datetime syntax/format. just have to be special dont they :P
[03:59:27] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[03:59:33] <bpalmer> rawtaz: Right. The next closest thing to reasonable is to have separately have a separate variable for the function
[03:59:58] <bpalmer> rawtaz: e.g., func main() { p := fmt.Println; fmt := MyStruct{}; p(fmt) }
[04:00:08] <bpalmer> but that's on the other side of the "reasonable" line
[04:00:17] <rawtaz> i agree :D

[04:01:13] <bpalmer> as for the other, it's not format for a reason; there are no format specifiers.
[04:01:31] <bpalmer> it *is* its own special thing that no other language uses, as far as I know, for better or worse.

[04:05:45] <rawtaz> right
[04:06:06] <rawtaz> yes, unfortunately IMO. but im going with the same term. with Go it's all or nothing
[04:06:24] <rawtaz> except one thing, i dont buy the "dont start error messages with a capital letter". thats just taking it too far :-)
[04:08:23] <b0nn> hrm, functions should be verbs, and structs nouns
[04:09:15] <rawtaz> +1
[04:11:45] <bpalmer> it all goes well until you come to set.
[04:13:13] <lazyreader> rawtaz I believe they push that one because error messages often get consumed into other strings, So you don't want random capitals. or punctuation.

[04:17:28] <rawtaz> yeah.. im just a bit disturbed by the non-capitalism after colons, e.g.  Unable to write data: unable to open file: open foo.txt: permission denied
[04:17:53] <rawtaz> IMO it would be much nicer grammar if each first char after colons were capitalized
[04:18:06] <rawtaz> i wonder if anyone else thinks that or if its just me :P
[04:18:10] <lazyreader> That's grammatically correct, though. Colons don't start new sentences.
[04:19:10] <rawtaz> yeah i think youre right. i just dont like it at all :> i wish grammar rulels were different on that part
[04:19:11] <bpalmer> well, perhaps orthographically correct rather than grammatically correct.
[04:19:50] <lazyreader> orthodontically correct
[04:19:57] <bpalmer> and even then, there are some style disagreements about it.
[04:19:59] <rawtaz> but there's a bunch of those fishy things in grammar. it's quite enjoyable to read about those that have been debated for decades, where even the major houses of typography and grammar etc cant find a conclusive "this is THE way" :)
[04:20:33] <lazyreader> anyway my advice is always "don't fight the formatter" when it comes to go

[04:30:04] <yonson> I am struggling with how to assign a variable outside of a closure. Any good references on this?  The db pointer is what is confusing me here: https://go.dev/play/p/DgzAC9aw4ZS
[04:30:29] <bpalmer> don't use :=
[04:30:43] <b0nn> https://go.dev/play/p/BP2USkfqMoJ
[04:30:46] <bpalmer> if it gets a chance to, := will create a new variable of that name, which shadows the outer one.
[04:31:18] <bpalmer> You get the same bug if you have something like 'var i int; if X() { i, err := Y(); ... } return i'   <-- you'll always return the value 0
[04:31:43] <yonson> ah, thanks. I was using it to init the err, didn't realize it was greedy

[16:14:40] <cobber> I'm stumbling on merging slices and variadics - is there any way to flatten a slice so that it can be used within a variadic list? e.g. line 24 https://go.dev/play/p/JpO1Zo6LK7U
[16:17:54] <fizzie> You can only call `Variadic(x, y, z)` or `Variadic(xs...)`, you can't mix and match. If you want to combine a bunch of values and slices, you'll have to do it explicitly, with append. Or possibly make it a `func Variadic(opts ...[]T)`, but then you'd have to wrap single values in slices explicitly.
[16:19:26] <cobber> and I thought I just didn't grok it :-) thanks for the clarification
[16:19:28] <fizzie> https://go.dev/play/p/7KWGjGsctxI as a single expression, though it gets a little unreadable that way.

[17:06:28] <siXy> neiluj: What's the usecase for a map of channels? It's pretty unusual that this is the correct answer to a problem
[17:08:04] <neiluj> There's a main routine which listen to incoming UDP packets, and it looks for an entry in the map of channels (map of callbacks) with the ID of the packet corresponding to a previous sent packet.
[17:08:17] <neiluj> so that it notifies the other thread that sent the initial packet.
[17:08:27] <neiluj> and gets the packet

[19:35:55] <crdpa> Tv_: the file.Name() is a string. Then i put the contents of this slice in a temporary text file appending "\n" to the end of each entry
[19:35:56] <Tv_> okay, let's say you're looking at `[]string{"long\nfile name.txt"}`, now what
[19:36:00] <siXy> seperately I'd also encourage you to stop putting newlines in file names.
[19:36:27] <crdpa> Tv_: it's easier if you see it in action, here: https://github.com/crdpa/gore
[19:36:29] <siXy> I get that fuzzing bash scripts is fun and all, but....

[19:37:27] <crdpa> Tv: in that case, the filename with \n in it is interpreted as a newline and the text file breaks the filename
[19:37:33] <crdpa> Tv_: yeah it's temporary
[19:37:50] <crdpa> Tv_: if you grab the release in the right you'll see what happens, the release was before i ignored the newlines

[22:19:29] <dostoyevsky2> I read on reddit today that google doesn't use Go for larger projects, only for smaller ones, microservices, as it doesn't have the tools to manage the complexity of larger projects

[22:20:29] <smrtz> Heyo! I'm writing a Makefile for a go project and I'm having trouble finding a "best practice" for `make install`? The GNU Make documentation says the `install` target shouldn't build, just move files. Is there any real reason I shouldn't just `go install` in the `install` target and let Go build the package?
[22:20:59] <siXy> dostoyevsky2: I wouldn't believe everything you read on reddit ;)
[22:21:19] <smrtz> Convention is to `make; sudo make install` and I'd like to avoid doing the build as root if possible?
[22:21:28] <dostoyevsky2> siXy: I only believe things I read on irc ;-)
[22:22:13] <siXy> smrtz: Generally go projects only use makefiles if they have a bunch of other complicated things they need to do. If all you're doing is go install - why use a makefile?
[22:22:22] <deniska> the less a language compilation process looks like C's, the less sense to use `make` for it

[22:23:24] <smrtz> That's a good point. I'm doing some updates to an existing system (where users are already running `make; sudo make install`) and would like to avoid changing their process if possible.
[22:24:13] <ikke> And not every one wants to install things in $GOPATH

[22:24:33] <cobber> personally I just use the Makefile as a collection of "here's how I work with this project" - e.g. how I run tests, generate docs etc. - mostly just simple commands, nothing in the way of dependencies - go does all that
[22:24:59] <smrtz> Also, t's quite a few `go install` lines with multiple differing arguments...

[22:25:20] <siXy> dostoyevsky2: I'd also add that what google does internally is a bad fit for basically everyone else - doing X because google does X is usually a terrible idea. Google has problems almost zero other companies on earth have to solve, and thus have reasons for choosing to do X that don't apply to anyone other than google.
[22:25:22] <avemestr> Who cares what Google (or any other FAANG) is using?
[22:25:47] <dostoyevsky2> I think the correct way is to consider Makefiles and then reimplement a half-assed make during a weekend because tabs...

[22:25:52] <siXy> If you're asking "can go be used for larger projects?" the answer to that is definitely yes.

[22:28:45] <smrtz> It's true there maybe better tools for the job normally, but in this situation I'm pretty locked in to the existing process.
[22:28:57] <ikke> you can use go build to build a binary
[22:29:03] <dostoyevsky2> Well, turns out, when it comes to tls/encryption I am Google.  Just give me the current standard algorithms all in the base languages, not in some obscure libraries
[22:29:05] <fizzie> smrtz: If you want a `make; sudo make install` style build, you might consider using `go build -o foo ./cmd/foo` to build your binaries, and then just plain old-fashioned `install` in the install target to put them where they need to go.
[22:29:07] <siXy> smrtz: in that case just use go build as your BUILD step.
