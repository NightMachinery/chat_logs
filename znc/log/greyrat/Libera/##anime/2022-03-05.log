[00:37:27] <Fenderbassist> I am 3rd generation American
[00:37:46] <AnbuMoha> Fenderbassist did you go out from your country when you were younger?
[00:38:14] <AnbuMoha> i think to understand you
[00:38:18] <Fenderbassist> my great grandparents & grandparents came to the USA from Ireland, Scotland, Austria and Italy back around 1899
[00:38:43] <Fenderbassist> so I consider my grandparents the first generation
[00:38:58] <Fenderbassist> since they were tiny when they came here
[00:39:03] <AnbuMoha> also for me was the same, i went here in italy because Palestine was too much poor

[00:49:23] <Fenderbassist> yes I'm a Batman fan too
[00:49:27] <Fenderbassist> Dark Knight, etc.
[00:50:00] <AnbuMoha> Fenderbassist i think DC is wonderful
[00:50:13] <AnbuMoha> better than Marvel, for me
[00:50:28] <Fenderbassist> I understand, I've liked both historically
[00:51:02] <Fenderbassist> is funny how they copied each other over the many years
[00:51:17] <AnbuMoha> but to be honest i think i won't watch the new batman
[00:51:53] <AnbuMoha> i can't image Patterson or Pattirson ( i forget the name ) as Batman
[00:52:16] <AnbuMoha> Fenderbassist absolute you are right
[00:53:08] <Fenderbassist> oh wow that's the new Bruce Wayne? 
[00:53:23] <Fenderbassist> I don't blame you, am not sure Robert Pattinson would sell as Bruce Wayne to me either
[00:53:28] <Fenderbassist> will have to see
[00:53:30] <Fenderbassist> I guess
[00:54:32] <AnbuMoha> Fenderbassist yes, without to be offensive, but i think he is too much female
[00:54:57] <AnbuMoha> *feminine
[00:56:15] <Nanobot> I wonder when Hololive will experience its first sexual harassment scandal. I mean... it seems like everyone sexually harasses everyone there. I wonder when somebody will publicly take issue with it.
[00:56:39] <AnbuMoha> i think in this new batman will put to many sex scene ( i am sure ) --> new age
[00:56:42] <Fenderbassist> have never seen but regret to hear of the harassment
[00:56:50] <Fenderbassist> AnbuMoha: possibly yes

[00:59:44] <TsundereNoises> I didn't realize that, but I think you guys are underestimating Robert Pattinson, his career over the past few years has been really interesting, don't stereotype him for being a sparkly teen vampire
[00:59:47] <AnbuMoha> Nanobot welcome to the new age
[01:00:08] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises yes i like him too much too
[01:00:16] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: wasn't there an actual thing with Mel and her manager or something?
[01:00:26] <Nanobot> New age? Dammit, do I have to drink tea, wear beads, and do yoga?
[01:00:39] <AnbuMoha> but bruce wayne pg requires a character more strong
[01:00:40] <Urchin[emacs]> Fenderbassist: there's an advantage of having a Bruce Wayne you wouldn't expect could be Batman
[01:01:10] <Bco1981> Nanobot: fauna bath water will do
[01:01:12] <TsundereNoises> AnbuMoha: did you see The Lighthouse or High Life?
[01:01:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Fenderbassist: Michael Keaton was a pretty good Batman
[01:01:23] <Nanobot> Tea is Fauna juice
[01:01:35] <TsundereNoises> is that like Lamy Water?
[01:01:45] <AnbuMoha> like body i think but also because bruce wayne kept the trauma of his parent dead
[01:02:02] <AnbuMoha> The Lighthouse no
[01:02:05] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: yes, the Mel and her manager was a big thing.
[01:02:08] <AnbuMoha> High Life no Xd
[01:02:15] <TsundereNoises> anyway, between Lighthouse, High Life, Good Time, Lost City of Z, I think Pattinson is a much better actor than people give him credit for

[01:06:41] <TsundereNoises> AnbuMoha: on the other hand, all the last like 15 DC movies have sucked, so I'm not expecting much
[01:07:04] <AnbuMoha> i like the original batman , that he didn't have need of woman or to be in love with someone else
[01:07:27] <AnbuMoha> i think the new batman will be in love too much with catwoman

[01:09:06] <Fenderbassist> yeah remains to be seen
[01:09:17] <Fenderbassist> would like to be pleasantly surprised
[01:09:18] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises i liked the previous dc movies XD
[01:09:28] <Fenderbassist> but I prefer old school batman over a new interpretation, personally
[01:09:47] <AnbuMoha> i found interesting the Wonder woman
[01:09:48] <Nanobot> I was trying to remember which critic I saw that liked it. But then I remembered it was Stuckman. So... I guess it's a pretty mainstream movie.
[01:10:05] <Fenderbassist> and being an old fogie, I prefer the animated Batman vs Superman that was based on the graphic novel
[01:10:14] <TsundereNoises> I actually think Batman Begins is my favorite, over Dark Knight
[01:10:45] <TsundereNoises> Batman vs. Superman has always been stupid, including the comic

[01:19:51] <AnbuMoha> Tenet was a great movie

[01:20:12] <AnbuMoha> the forced me to delete
[01:20:26] <Fenderbassist> TsundereNoises: I need to rewatch Rear Window, haven't seen that one in ages and I have it on disc
[01:20:33] <AnbuMoha> never more watched after the first session
[01:20:55] <TsundereNoises> Uneeded love stories are also pretty old though, they've been doing that forever
[01:21:16] <TsundereNoises> Fenderbassist: Rear Window WAS my favorite, I still like it, I just hadn't seen Rope before
[01:22:00] <Fenderbassist> gotcha, I haven't seen Rope yet myself
[01:22:03] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises: it's stupid, if i want to take a part of a love story i can go to the bar or in disco...
[01:22:36] <TsundereNoises> AnbuMoha: by that logic movies should never have dogs in them because you could just go buy a dog

[01:24:28] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises yes to be honest i don't like too much the movie about the animals also for this reason, i won't buy a dog because i saw a happy family with a dog in a movie
[01:25:21] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises it's stupid trying to convince me to buy a dog with a happy scene in a movie XD
[01:25:23] <AnbuMoha> i think
[01:25:36] <AnbuMoha> *movies
[01:25:45] <TsundereNoises> AnbuMoha: what I mean though is that most movies have SOME element of everyday life to them, and there's nothing wrong with that
[01:26:07] <TsundereNoises> a romance can be done BAD (and often is) but sometimes the story is about that, and not just in romance movies
[01:26:24] <TsundereNoises> Casablanca or North by Northwest would be much different movies with no romantic element
[01:26:25] <AnbuMoha> ok i understood
[01:26:30] <TsundereNoises> and I'd argue much worse movies
[01:26:47] <Fenderbassist> love Casablanca and To Have Or Have Not
[01:27:00] <Fenderbassist> North By Northwest as well
[01:27:23] <TsundereNoises> like if Rick was just some guy and there were no feelings, how the fuck would Casablanca make any sense, you know?
[01:27:55] <AnbuMoha> i don't know, sorry
[01:30:02] <Fenderbassist> yeah they would have had to turn him into a guerilla fighter or something
[01:30:04] <Fenderbassist> lol
[01:30:14] <AnbuMoha> but i like anime also for this , no sex only men and women able to become what they want. Movie i think often is boring because there are a lot of parallelism with this our materialism
[01:30:26] <AnbuMoha> i don't know if you feeling the same
[01:31:03] <TsundereNoises> I'm not sure what you mean
[01:31:14] <AnbuMoha> *movies
[01:31:36] <Fenderbassist> so you feel anime shows people improving themselves while movies show how bad our cultures are today?
[01:31:41] <TsundereNoises> But in general I feel like a lot of the big cultural criticisms people have about movies tend to apply to a lot of movies that do well financially
[01:31:47] <AnbuMoha> *inside the Hollywood movie there area lot of
[01:31:55] <TsundereNoises> and when I say I like movies a lot, usually I'm talking about stuff that no one saw for whatever reason
[01:31:58] <AnbuMoha> *movies again, sorry
[01:32:02] <TsundereNoises> I wish people would see a broader range of things
[01:32:49] <AnbuMoha> TsundereNoises you are right i have this wrong approach too
[01:33:16] <TsundereNoises> I often have conversations with people that say "no good movies came out last year"
[01:33:24] <TsundereNoises> but then they only watched superhero movies or something
[01:33:45] <TsundereNoises> and I'd be very willing to agree, many years, that no good superhero movies came out that year

[05:21:26] <shlomo> ah yeah that would be nice
[05:22:00] <MootPoot> most of my complaints around smartphone cameras has to do with the lack of zoom
[05:22:36] <shlomo> yeah my camera is absolutely awful
[05:22:56] <MootPoot> and that s22 ultra with that 10x lens still has no microsd slot... despite being like 1500 dollars
[05:23:10] <shlomo> i have a dslr so if i want a really nice photo i'll just use that, i don't travel much
[05:23:22] <shlomo> MootPoot: that's criminal
[05:23:50] <MootPoot> I would have actually bought it if it had a slot
[05:23:54] <MootPoot> so idk what to even say
[05:24:04] <shlomo> yeah for real, they shot themselves in the foot there
[05:24:12] <shlomo> what a waste of really cool tech
[05:25:20] <MootPoot> so the only option left is 1.) keep on using my v60 for another year or two - its now 2 years old 2.) go get that xperia
[05:26:17] <shlomo> you could check out the dev scene for the xperias if custom rom support is important to you
[05:26:24] <jessedesu_onaph> I bought $400 of stuff on Amazon to fill the void in my life

[05:47:20] <MootPoot> Sadale: I bought a new microsd card
[05:47:27] <MootPoot> to put all my hentai on
[05:47:27] <MootPoot> :3
[05:47:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol nice. Why microsd tho?
[05:47:41] <Sadale> So that you could put that into your phone?
[05:47:45] <MootPoot> fits in my tablet
[05:47:57] <MootPoot> I already have a 512gb card for my phone
[05:49:41] <MootPoot> so apparently there are like 5 different microSD standards
[05:49:43] <MootPoot> and I hate them 
[05:49:53] <MootPoot> why cant there just be one
[05:50:06] <shlomo> haha there's an xkcd about this
[05:50:25] <shlomo> https://xkcd.com/927/
[05:50:25] <ImoutoBot> [title] xkcd: Standards
[05:51:28] <MootPoot> there is speed class, there is UHS speed class, there is Video speed class ( all for serial sustained write ), there is SD / SDXC for capacity, and now there is application class A1/A2 for IOPS AND there is UHS-II which adds an entire new row of pins on it
[05:51:31] <MootPoot> shlomo: not exactly
[05:51:42] <MootPoot> shlomo: the different standards dont fight in this case
[05:51:57] <MootPoot> they just are like a game of how many labels you can stick on your sd card
[05:51:58] <shlomo> ah yeah, UHS speed class 3 is good for up to 30MB/s
[05:52:05] <shlomo> like 4k videos
[05:52:21] <MootPoot> but...UHS speec class 3 also also V30 
[05:52:24] <MootPoot> for video class 30
[05:52:25] <shlomo> yes
[05:52:26] <MootPoot> :3
[05:52:29] <MootPoot> lmao
[05:52:36] <MootPoot> what a dumb labelling system
[05:52:56] <MootPoot> just label capacity, IOPS, and sustained read/write
[05:52:57] <shlomo> it is haha, but at least if you only know 1 term you should be able to find it among all the others
[05:52:58] <MootPoot> thats it
[05:53:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, A single SD card contains all those "classes".
[05:53:25] <MootPoot> Sadale: I know
[05:53:30] <MootPoot> thats why I called it a labelling problem
[05:53:31] <Sadale> Anyway yes there's SD and SDXC thingie. But I don't notice any difference between them :P
[05:53:48] <shlomo> schc is way slower afaik
[05:53:53] <shlomo> *sdhc
[05:53:59] <MootPoot> SD / SDXC is just capacity
[05:54:03] <MootPoot> has nothing to do with speed
[05:54:06] <shlomo> oh i thought it was speed too
[05:54:09] <shlomo> interesting
[05:54:10] <MootPoot> SD is 4gb max
[05:54:13] <MootPoot> like fat32
[05:54:16] <shlomo> gotcha
[05:54:18] <MootPoot> SDXC is upto 2tb
[05:56:07] <Sadale> IIRC they're backward compatible
[05:56:11] <Sadale> Most modern card reader supports all the SD card standards, AFAIK.
[05:56:16] <MootPoot> I know
[05:56:22] <Sadale> At least I haven't encountered a problem with SD card :P
[05:56:23] <MootPoot> its just a labelling problem
[05:56:36] <MootPoot> it annoys me that I had to actually look up what all the standards meant
[05:56:46] <MootPoot> rather then just looking at the card and instantly knowing what it can do
[05:56:52] <Sadale> Before I had SSD I was actually thinking if I could use a A2 SD card as a fast HDD cache drive

[05:58:47] <MootPoot> 4k is kinda pointless on those
[05:59:16] <shlomo> ah i still have 1080p but it's 144hz
[05:59:44] <MootPoot> my main pc has triple 4k

[06:00:40] <Sadale> Costed me like $5 xD
[06:00:54] <MootPoot> Sadale: for VR to look like there are no pixels you need like 12k or something
[06:00:57] <MootPoot> even 8k isen't enough
[06:01:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, And you need high refresh rate
[06:01:51] <MootPoot> on VR and PC yes
[06:01:53] <Sadale> And you need decent hardware to play that.
[06:01:58] <MootPoot> on phones and tablet I dont really care
[06:02:02] <MootPoot> my phone is still 60hz
[06:02:21] <Sadale> I've got a redmi note 10 pro. It has 120Hz. I'm not sure on how good the software support is.
[06:02:26] <MootPoot> there isen't really any point imo - you get smoother animation but it does not meaninfully change anything
[06:02:35] <Sadale> And I think many apps doesn't support higher refresh rate.
[06:02:38] <MootPoot> afaik almost no phone games actually can go above 60
[06:02:48] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah, the most common ones are all capped at 60
[06:02:53] <Sadale> sad
[06:02:54] <MootPoot> and most phones cant go beyond 60
[06:03:22] <Sadale> I find it interesting that I can easily tell the difference between 120 and 60 tho. The UI's much smoother at 120hz
[06:03:37] <Sadale> gaming time! :D
[06:03:39] <MootPoot> Sadale: now tell that to emmeka and amigo
[06:03:40] <MootPoot> :3

[06:03:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, ha
[06:03:57] <Sadale> amigojapan, FYI: ^
[06:04:11] <MootPoot> Sadale: its basically instantly noticable
[06:04:29] <Sadale> true. I didn't believe that as well until I actually got a 120Hz phone
[06:04:44] <MootPoot> ...
[06:04:47] <Sadale> They've got a config for switching between 60hz and 120hz. And I can instantly notice the difference
[06:04:54] * MootPoot whacks sadale
[06:05:00] <MootPoot> Baka!
[06:05:20] <Sadale> By default it's at 60hz. Then I tapped on the 120hz out of curiousity. And tada! It's much smoother. :O

[09:44:54] <jessedesu_onaph> Are we having a Chinese lesson
[09:45:21] <Sadale> ButterNoodle apparently speaks a bit Chinese and he asked about what I said in Chinese. So I explained that.
[09:45:32] <ButterNoodle> yes
[09:45:36] <Sapphirus> I wish I could speak another language
[09:45:46] <ButterNoodle> *I just know what a few hundred of the characters mean
[09:45:50] <ButterNoodle> bc japanese
[09:46:02] <ButterNoodle> loosely what they mean
[09:46:08] <Sadale> Lesson 1. salutation. nihao - hi. xiexie - thanks. zaijian/baibai - bye.
[09:46:21] <Sadale> lol I actually can't speak Mandarin well. I speak Canto
[09:46:35] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: lisp
[09:46:39] <jessedesu_onaph> They teach Chinese in some elite high schools in America to prep the next generation for global business

[09:46:55] <ButterNoodle> chii shii
[09:46:59] <MootPoot> Chin chin 
[09:47:02] <Sapphirus> I'd rather know Japanese if there was ever one language.
[09:47:04] <jessedesu_onaph> Like in Colorado or utah
[09:47:12] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: its a shit language though 
[09:47:17] <MootPoot> Weebery aside 
[09:47:24] <ButterNoodle> yuuchuun de baichi
[09:47:25] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, you shut your damned mouth, bud.

[09:48:48] <ButterNoodle> yall dont have sugar free maple?? bc that would be about the same kinda abomination as saying u dont like japanese in an anime channel
[09:48:49] <Sadale> Sapphirus, if you just wanna learn a language, try Toki Pona. It's probably the easiest language to learn with only ~150 words. It's the second most-spoken constructed language, only after Esperanto. :3
[09:48:52] <MootPoot> English has its one problem

[09:49:20] <Sapphirus> Sedale, but that wouldn't have any utility. 
[09:49:22] <MootPoot> Tbh 
[09:49:25] <Sadale> So many words. I can't read it.
[09:49:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Sadale I feel like you said that exact sentence 2 weeks ago
[09:49:39] <MootPoot> But yeah, as the lunatic Canadian said, not much utility 
[09:49:41] <Sadale> Sapphirus, true. It's mainly for socialization with other toki pona speakers xD
[09:49:45] <MootPoot> Not enough other people use it 
[09:49:49] <Sadale> And it's mostly for fun
[09:49:55] <MootPoot> It's like learning brain fuck 
[09:50:10] <MootPoot> Instead of searching brainfuck on nhentai
[09:50:10] <jessedesu_onaph> Learn klingon
[09:50:17] <Sadale> jessedesu_onaph, yeah. That's because I speak the langauge. And I find it fun to learn and to use it. :P
[09:50:37] <jessedesu_onaph> Speak valley girl
[09:50:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Like totally
[09:50:46] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: being a weeb dosent prevent me from shitting on Japan when it needs shitting 
[09:50:56] <MootPoot> They just enacted control on crossbows 
[09:51:00] <MootPoot> Lame 
[09:51:03] <Sadale> There's only one word for animal sound. That's "mu!" It can refer to the sound of a dog, or a cat, or a wolf, or an elephant, or whatever animal it is :3
[09:51:05] * Sadale mu! :3
[09:51:35] <MootPoot> Sadale: so for furry sex they can only make Mu mu mu noises 
[09:51:39] <MootPoot> Is that right 
[09:51:50] <Sadale> haha. yep :P
[09:52:30] <jessedesu_onaph> That's a cow sound
[09:52:36] <Sadale> It actually depends on the context. With limited amount of words, you have to be very creative in using the words. So mu could also mean moaning of human, or perhaps even alarm sound.
[09:53:00] <ButterNoodle> or the sounds a cow makes when mating
[09:53:58] <MootPoot> moo moo motherfucker
[09:54:06] <MootPoot> plough harder

[13:44:50] <Sapphirus> I had a similar thought, and I even dug my geiger counter out.
[13:45:01] <JesseDesu> but then i read this comment
[13:45:08] <Sapphirus> Then I realised I might've been overdramatising.
[13:45:11] <JesseDesu> 6500 H-bombs raining down
[13:45:18] <JesseDesu> iodine pills arent gonna save you
[13:45:32] <Sapphirus> Nah, although I'm glad I impulse bought a geiger counte.r
[13:45:45] <JesseDesu> theres probably enough nukes to hit every major city twice or thrice
[13:46:22] <JesseDesu> btw my first amazon package arrived, one of 8

[13:46:36] <JesseDesu> lol
[13:46:42] <JesseDesu> filling the void that is my life
[13:48:30] <Sapphirus> So I bought a plastic bin to store litter
[13:48:43] <Sapphirus> Arrived with a broken latch so it's utterly useless
[13:48:56] <Sapphirus> Amazon sent me a replacement without having to ship the old one back -- yay
[13:52:23] <Sapphirus> I'm going to the repurpose it. Made the lid shut tight-ish without latches using some adhesive rubber strips I had laying around.
[13:53:02] <Sapphirus> Saves it from a landfill, I guess.
[13:53:51] <Sapphirus> Amazon's customer service actually pulled a miracle for me today.
[13:54:07] <Sapphirus> err yesterday, I guess. lol
[13:54:52] <Sapphirus> JesseDesu, so what did you buy?

[13:59:01] *** Quits: tafami (~tafami@103.225.136.98) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:00:28] <Sapphirus> Beat Saber is probably one of the only VR games that I consider to not be some sort of tech demo.
[14:02:03] <MootPoot> HL alyx has shown how good VR games can be - now it's just a market problem
[14:02:12] <MootPoot> not a lot of people have the PC and the headset 
[14:03:14] <Sapphirus> There's good reason for that. Lot of people, myself included, see it at something very gimmicky.
[14:03:44] <MootPoot> sure, but gaming is also gimmicky really
[14:03:49] <MootPoot> for people who dont
[14:03:51] <Sapphirus> When I think of VR, I think of people with money to spend that have nothing better to do with it. 
[14:03:58] <name10> amigojapan: hey
[14:04:39] <MootPoot> hmm
[14:04:42] <MootPoot> I need water
[14:05:18] <Sapphirus> There's a lot of people out there with properly equipped systems that won't ever bother with it.
[14:05:47] <MootPoot> your point?
[14:06:19] <amigojapan> hey name10
[14:06:26] <Sapphirus> They've been at it for this many years and the market hasn't evolved much over the last 5 years. 
[14:06:38] <name10> amigojapan: i need to watch some anime
[14:06:38] <amigojapan> name10: just got my 3rd shot
[14:06:42] <name10> ok :)
[14:06:46] <Sapphirus> Point is that the growth potential may be at its limit and has been for awhile.
[14:06:51] <name10> i have had the corona so i don't need a shot :)
[14:06:56] <MootPoot> Its probably never going to be the super meta default that people thought it would be
[14:07:00] <name10> amigojapan: ^^^
[14:07:12] <amigojapan> name10: you can get corona more htan once
[14:07:13] <MootPoot> although that's true of basically most technologies
[14:07:16] <name10> ok
[14:07:41] <MootPoot> you use bullshit and wild dreams in the start, it has a crash, then it just quietly chuggs along
[14:07:45] <Sapphirus> Beat Saber is probably peak VR and I don't know if I'd want to spend $600+ on a headset just to play that one game.
[14:07:53] <MootPoot> more like 300
[14:08:24] <Sapphirus> Even at $300, is it justifiable on what it might be able to do in the future?
[14:08:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: the only VR I am interested in is VRchat, and am quite happy with just the desktop verion
[14:08:37] <MootPoot> you just buy it based on what it can do now
[14:08:42] <MootPoot> and for 300, I'm more then happy
[14:09:23] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, and I'd imagine a good chunk of people would be.
[14:09:36] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I am also happy they recently started supporting Linux, but i doubt they support VR on linux
[14:10:12] <Sapphirus> VR on Linux is only supported by Valve and its scope is very narrow
[14:10:34] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: its a steam game tho
[14:10:40] <Sapphirus> If I really wanted to invest in VR, I'd stick a second graphics card into my machine and boot up a Windows VM.
[14:11:22] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, you'd probably have the most luck with a SteamVR headset.

[14:55:44] <Sapphirus> I don't think I could've avoided it if I wanted to given I have family that works in healthcare. 
[14:56:01] <amigojapan> I see, ouch
[14:57:20] <Sapphirus> Worst part was losing my smell for over a month and then the sleep disruption which followed
[14:57:45] <Sapphirus> Thankfully that's all behind me and I feel normal again.
[14:58:10] <amigojapan> fantastic!
[14:58:27] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: why is losing sense of smell so important?
[14:59:16] <Sapphirus> Because it's a neurological side effect.
[14:59:19] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: I'm already considering applying to a traditional masters that is online 
[14:59:35] <Sapphirus> Sleep-related issues were probably similar in nature.
[14:59:45] <amigojapan> I see
[15:00:54] <Sapphirus> Melatonin for 5-6 months fixed the sleep issues.
[15:01:21] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: Melatonin in Japan is a prescription medicine
[15:01:30] <Sapphirus> Tried coming off of it a few times and the sleep issues came right back the next night
[15:02:10] <Sapphirus> That's how I was able to determine that it wasn't depression related or anything. Symptoms came back like clockwork.
[15:02:22] <Sapphirus> Until they didn't, 5-6 months after taking it every night.
[15:02:27] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: almost no loan , I'll have it paid off maybe in a month or two
[15:02:55] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, if that were the case here, I might've ended up in the hospital or something.
[15:03:11] <Sapphirus> Took two weeks for me to get a week of consistent sleep 
[15:04:08] <Sapphirus> Sleep degradation was so bad that I was beginning to have heart palpitations. 
[15:04:53] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: that does not mean that you cant get it, you just need to get a prescription for it
[15:05:49] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: Melatonin is not a completly safe substance for evrybody, and it also depends on dosage
[15:05:55] *** Quits: ymwm (~yingmanwu@27.153.164.187) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:06:49] <Sapphirus> I probably should've used a higher dosage to begin with, but that would've required doctor supervision and I was too much of a pansy to see my family doctor.
[15:06:49] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: if I have to go to Europe then it's probably not worth it financially 
[15:07:24] <HubertFarnsworth> nice MootPoot, I think it'd still be better if you have like two years job experience before masters. If you get an even okay job, go for it.
[15:07:29] <Sapphirus> Took two weeks,like I mentioned, and that was at 10mgs per night.
[15:07:41] <Sapphirus> I sustained that for 5-6 months before the long-haul sleep issues disappeared.
[15:08:22] <amigojapan> I see Sapphirus
[15:09:39] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I heard that many people get problems form over dosing on Melatonin cause they think it is harmless cause it is over the counter, so i think it makes more sense in Japan with it being prescription
[15:10:09] *** Joins: ymwm (~yingmanwu@27.153.164.187)
[15:10:15] <Sapphirus> Yeah, I can see that, but in my case I had nothing to lose as I was already on a critically low amount of sleep.

[15:12:27] <amigojapan> I see

[15:14:01] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: the thing that was much much better at least for us, is that we hardly had to wait at all at the clinic, there were no other people there taking the vaccine, but last 2 times the clinic was overflowing with people and it took forever

[15:16:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: did you know there is a theme for XFCE which makes it look exaactly like windows 95?
[15:16:27] <HubertFarnsworth> if it takes too long it's not worth it MootPoot. After you have about five years or so working experience, masters and other educational details are irrelevant. I mean your work experience weighs a lot than those. If you get masters soon then you will be working in different line of work altogether with new skills and what not.
[15:17:03] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I tried it and could never get it to look as good as it does in the screenshots.
[15:17:14] <MootPoot> amigojapan: no
[15:17:28] <amigojapan> oh thats too bad Sapphirus
[15:18:08] <Sapphirus> Cohesion starts to fall apart once you start using applications that don't conform to that design language anymore.
[15:18:10] <HubertFarnsworth> what specialization in masters are you interested MootPoot?
[15:18:13] <HubertFarnsworth> what? which*
[15:18:17] <amigojapan> I guess also wide screen takes away form the retro look
[15:18:25] <Sapphirus> yeah, that also does, too.
[15:18:53] <Sapphirus> I've got Windows 98 in a PC emulator for some old games. 
[15:18:55] <MootPoot> The default menu bar in KDE plasma is like looking at chromeos windows and Mac and taking the worst parts of all of their launcher

[15:20:12] <Sapphirus> Some Japanese game like Puyo Puyo from the 90s I've been playing on it.

[15:21:19] <Sapphirus> Eats up 80-90% of one core on my 5950x to emulate a K6-II processor from the 1990s
[15:21:41] <Sapphirus> Software emulation is extremely expensive :P
[15:21:42] <Bco1981> Sapphirus: in dosbox?
[15:21:42] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: why is it a beefy processor instead of a fishy one or a chickeny one
[15:22:00] <Sapphirus> Bco1981, nah, a PC Emulator.

[15:22:56] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I'll eat Ur box
[15:23:11] <MootPoot> Fishy BIOS
[15:23:14] <Sapphirus> Basically a complete x86 system emulator
[15:23:26] <MootPoot> Or fishy UEFI

[15:23:35] <MootPoot> What about porky cpu
[15:23:40] <Bco1981> yeah i see.
[15:23:44] <Sapphirus> and the voodoo drivers work inside of Windows 98 properly :P
[15:23:48] <MootPoot> Is that a slow cpu
[15:24:32] <Sapphirus> voodoo 3 is a graphics card from a long time ago
[15:24:43] <MootPoot> You'd think maybe fishy CPU or chickeny would be faster because they are lean meats 
[15:24:46] <MootPoot> But nooo
[15:24:55] <MootPoot> Beefy is the fastest
[15:26:15] <Sapphirus> Been having some fun on&off playing around with PCem.
[15:26:16] <Bco1981> Sapphirus: so... can this then give me the 1600x1200 24bit windows 3.11 i want ?
[15:26:34] <Sapphirus> Nah, you are limited to the constraints of the hardware it's emulating.
[15:27:21] <Sapphirus> Be as slow as you'd remember it being on the hardware of the time (i don't remember, but you probably would)
[15:27:54] <Bco1981> pretty sure hdd's was the issue of things being slow back then.
[15:28:09] <Sapphirus> Processing power and whatnot was also a bottleneck.
[15:28:12] <Bco1981> that's why i'm rebuilding some of them, and using compact flash this time.
[15:28:29] <Sapphirus> I/O bottleneck is gone unless you want to plop the disk image onto a slow HDD for that genuine 1990s experience
[15:28:40] <Sapphirus> It's still slow, though.
[15:29:16] <Sapphirus> just not painfully slow
[15:30:06] <Bco1981> i bought a amdk6-3 400mhz, they usualy overclock nicely to 550mhz

[15:30:32] <Bco1981> i have two super socket 7 motherboards, but not sure if they work... i need to test them.
[15:31:05] <Sapphirus> PCem emulates SS7 quite well, from what I can tell. 
[15:31:40] <Bco1981> and i want to try running windows 3.11 on that 550mhz with 64mb sd ram and compact flash as the discs. lets see where the bottleneck is. :3
[15:32:04] <Bco1981> probably the IDE controller

[17:17:05] <amigojapan> yep, darkwitch but I think it will end up treated simillar to the flu, taking a booster shot once a year or something
[17:17:24] <amigojapan> S4ll3n: it could still go up
[17:17:56] <emmeka> I think the consensus at this point was "either of the omicron variants are vastly more contagious, but of similar to lesser lethality compared to previous strains, and the risk of hospitalization for the fully vaccinated without prior health complications is low"
[17:18:28] <emmeka> the reason the rest of the world is now less worried about omicron is because hospitalization rates declined drastically even as caseload climbed
[17:18:49] <emmeka> and even caseload is now decreasing in North America, at least
[17:19:04] <amigojapan> emmeka: well up to today, we had not gotten our third shot, which is late compared to other countries
[17:20:00] <emmeka> that's even better, but even 2 shots offered robust protection against severe symptoms, if not against infection
[17:20:50] <S4ll3n> Only problem is the vaccines are lagging behind on newer mutations
[17:20:57] <amigojapan> alright emmeka, we will try to keep up to date with boosters as new variants keep on commin out
[17:21:36] <emmeka> we'll probably just end up with annual vaccine cocktails offered targetting strains based mostly on predictions, like the flu

[17:22:06] <S4ll3n> yeah, plus they have effective anti-viral treatments now too
[17:22:07] <amigojapan> emmeka:that is what it seems like yes
[17:22:14] <S4ll3n> thats what the big game changer was
[17:22:31] <emmeka> that is true yes, there are actual treatments besides easing symptoms
[17:22:58] <amigojapan> like tamiflu for flu?
[17:23:07] <emmeka> what's interesting is that over the past 2 years we have basically eliminated flu deaths
[17:23:22] <emmeka> and any return to normal will likely bring those back to normal levels
[17:23:31] <amigojapan> emmeka: we should keep it up
[17:23:49] <S4ll3n> I suspect flu deaths are still happening, I don't think they are testing for the flu
[17:24:13] <amigojapan> S4ll3n: you need to request a flu test
[17:24:29] <emmeka> S4ll3n well part of it is that most people who would've died of the flu, instead got COVID
[17:24:34] <amigojapan> S4ll3n: flu tests are always available
[17:24:51] <S4ll3n> yeah, but if you have flu like symtoms most people are going to get a covid test
[17:24:59] <emmeka> but also, the flu is far less transmissable, so our public health measures worked much better against it
[17:25:28] <Roey> you guys think what they call the covid "vaccines" are effective?
[17:25:45] <amigojapan> yes roey
[17:25:49] <Roey> I see.
[17:26:11] <Roey> like, despite Omicron having swept by everyone, infecting them and conferring immunity on them?
[17:26:26] <amigojapan> roey they prevent severe covid
[17:26:44] <Roey> immunity that even the CDC now says is just as robust as that from the "vaccines"?
[17:26:49] <amigojapan> Roey: we did not get omicron
[17:27:20] <Roey> yeah you're getting it too.  Only that it's just a cold.
[17:27:50] <emmeka> Roey it appears to have effectiveness surpassing most flu vaccines, at the very least
[17:28:00] <emmeka> what's with this line of argument anyway
[17:28:12] <amigojapan> roey we are having abot 200 deaths per day from mocron in japan now
[17:28:18] <emmeka> "it's not a REAL vaccine because it isn't 100% totally garaunteed effective always!!!!"
[17:28:27] <emmeka> like, this is now how vaccines have ever worked
[17:28:50] <emmeka> *not how
[17:30:36] <darkwitch> amigojapan, mocron? I had hoped you would write "200 deaths per day from macron in japan now"
[17:31:04] <amigojapan> emmeka: unfortunately we are full of missinformation on this as usual
[17:31:23] <emmeka> Roey the hard data is this: the vaccine has reduced, but nonzero efficacy at preventing infection with Omicron. That efficacy wanes with time: those last vaccinated over 6 months ago have less protection, those recently boosted have more. But, the vaccine is *very* effective at preventing severe symptoms, at creating an effective immune response.
[17:31:28] <amigojapan> lol darkwitch
[17:31:57] <emmeka> Roey and, yes, your immune system is capable of doing that on its own too, assuming you survived a previous infection without vaccination. But these effects also stack!

[17:44:08] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: most people would die of hunger in case of nuclear war, due to nuclear winter, so it's very drawn out unless you live in a big city on one of the major sides, or near a missile silo

[17:45:29] <emmeka> S4ll3n yes yes I know, but you're ruining my fun
[17:45:31] <S4ll3n> when they droped nukes on Japan, ALOT of Japanese major citys had already been carpet bombed or fire bombed
[17:46:49] <S4ll3n> again, carpet bombing was useless too
[17:46:56] <emmeka> yes, yes. the reason Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targetted, comparatively small cities, were because the rest were already ash. The firebombing of Kobe and Tokyo killed more people than the nukes.
[17:47:33] <name10> amigojapan: fren
[17:47:38] <S4ll3n> Those citys were industrial citys if I remember correctly
[17:48:09] <S4ll3n> however overall carpet bombing was pointless
[17:48:28] <emmeka> S4ll3n there's also some evidence that the Japanese high command did not actually believe American claims and the reports from Hiroshima, they had themselves attempted a nuclear weapons program, and knew it to be very difficult so they suspected it was a bluff
[17:49:25] <amigojapan> Hey name10 
[17:50:02] <S4ll3n> yeah.
[17:51:12] <S4ll3n> They did a study on carpet bombing and fire bombing after ww2 in the 1950's and 1960's.  it was found to have limited impact on the war over all.  however they kept the report surpressed becuase of the number of air crews they lost
[17:51:23] <amigojapan> emmeka: my grandfather that was an adult during the war said Japan was ready to surrender when they dropped the bombs anyway. And he was American. I trust him
[17:52:06] <S4ll3n> amigojapan I've read that too
[17:53:01] <amigojapan> Nice S4ll3n 
[17:53:36] <amigojapan> emmeka: and why didn't they drop them in Germany too?
[17:53:51] <emmeka> the war had already ended in Germany by then.

[17:59:19] <DPA> They had also plans to use nukes to make tunnels & stuff, but they abandoned those when someone noticed that the radiation wasn't just a small problem that could be dealt with later.

[18:01:05] <DPA> They had a lot of plans to create "useful" things by using them.
[18:01:15] <emmeka> Exact chronology is this, it seems: Aug 6, Hiroshima bombed. August 9, 4am, word of Soviet declaration of war and invasion reaches Tokyo. 10:30am, council meets to discuss surrender. 11am, news of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki reaches Tokyo. 2:30pm, Japanese cabinet meets in full. After much debate with the cabinet split between surrender and pressing on, 2am Aug 10, the emperor himself decides he is in favour of unconditional 
[18:01:15] <emmeka> surrender.
[18:01:40] <emmeka> there is some fuckery and an attempted coup in the intervening days, but the emperor's decision is broadcast in full on Aug 15
