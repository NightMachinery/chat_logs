[01:24:18] <aphysically> oh... python's shlex.quote isn't good enough for encoding pathnames in ffconcat
[01:24:21] <aphysically> shoot
[01:26:28] <aphysically> all it says is "Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with backslash or single quotes. "
[01:26:39] <edman007> Hrm, is there a reason that the format filter doesn't work right converting YUVJ420P to YUV420P? the best I can tell, the difference is just the color range is different. But when I do it (coupled with HWupload), it converts to greyscale, with a big vertical green  bar in the middle
[01:26:48] <aphysically> is there somewhere that documents the exact escaping needed? i.e. what special characters?

[01:40:50] <edman007> let me try with the system one actually...
[01:41:33] <edman007> wait, can't do system because it's missing the HEVC decoder
[01:42:14] <edman007> though converting to something different, like YUV440P actually works fine...
[01:42:22] <durandal_1707> edman007: how old git?
[01:43:01] <edman007> sept 30th
[01:43:07] <durandal_1707> use newer one

[01:43:19] <edman007> ok
[01:43:25] <durandal_1707> format filter auto inserts scale filter
[01:43:40] <durandal_1707> and scale fitler now have slice threading support
[01:43:51] <durandal_1707> but it is not without some bugs
[01:44:48] <durandal_1707> you can use format=xxx,scale=threads=1 perhaps it would be good workaround for you? (havent tried this yet)
[01:45:34] <edman007> well rebuilding and we will see
[01:45:38] <aphysically> maybe the best solution for ffconcat is just escape every character? not sure how this interactions with what python considers a character for looping

[18:51:25] <DmanT> hi all
[18:51:49] <DmanT> has ffmpeg a way to encrypt audio and video files?
[18:54:27] <JEEB> I think there was a crypt protocol in theory, and then in mp4 writing the cenc way of encryption is supported
[18:54:48] <JEEB> there's even a test in the FFmpeg FATE test suite that it works end-to-end
[18:55:03] <JEEB> so that you can encrypt stuff into an mp4, and then read that stuff back out of it, providing the key
[18:55:14] <JEEB> (and the otehr thing, the nonce or whatever it was?)

[19:06:06] <JEEB> you of course have to feed it the parameters :P
[19:06:32] <JEEB> in case of the mp4 reader, it has got AVOptions to set them
[19:06:55] <JEEB> and you basically hope that your player (if it uses FFmpeg to read the file) allows you to set those options
[19:07:07] <JEEB> if not, you will have to figure out if your player supports it at all
[19:07:26] <JEEB> as usual, it takes two for tango :P

[20:00:31] <JEEB> also for the record, a few things about the UDP URL
[20:00:43] <JEEB> the @ symbol does not do what it does most likely (in FFmpeg, it does nothing)
[20:01:05] <JEEB> overrun_nonfatal option is generally recommended in random places, but it just hides whatever the underlying issue is :)
[20:01:18] <JEEB> since it just means that your process is not processing the data fast enough
[20:01:50] <JEEB> also you can set those options just normally before `-i INPUT`
[20:01:59] <JEEB> like -fifo_size 50000000
[20:02:45] <JEEB> also please check how the fifo_size option is defined
[20:02:50] <JEEB> you are probably expecting bytes
[20:02:53] <JEEB> it is not in bytes
[20:02:54] <JEEB> :)
[20:03:12] <AboimPinto> https://pastebin.com/tMXj8kSt
[20:03:13] <JEEB> also another option related to fifo_size in UDP protocol is buffer_size, which is in bytes
[20:03:26] <JEEB> yea, so you just decoding stuff works. great
[20:03:42] <AboimPinto> yes ... looks like that part works
[20:04:10] <JEEB> what if you set -timeout 500000 before the UDP input?

[20:04:33] <JEEB> I am going to guess that is going to make it fail normally
[20:04:44] <JEEB> you are just most likely thinking that you are specifying the UDP URL properly
[20:04:52] <JEEB> while libavformat (the library) disagrees
[20:07:46] <AboimPinto> now I get an error ..
[20:07:47] <AboimPinto> https://pastebin.com/EYXw6BCr
[20:07:55] <JEEB> yup
[20:08:03] <JEEB> so let's start from point zero
[20:08:13] <JEEB> what is the thing you are trying to connect to through UDP
[20:08:18] <JEEB> as in, multicast or unicast or what :)
[20:08:30] <JEEB> and do you need to specify a specific network adapter for it
[20:08:56] <AboimPinto> adapter should be /dev/video42
[20:09:14] <JEEB> you are I/O timing out with your UDP input
[20:09:28] <JEEB> so clearly how you think what you are specifying and how libavformat interprets it are different
[20:09:34] <JEEB> let me give an example
[20:09:47] <JEEB> I have a UDP multicast running on localhost
[20:09:54] <JEEB> for libavformat I would specify it as follows
[20:10:22] <JEEB> `-localaddr 127.0.0.1 udp://239.255.255.1:1337`
[20:10:57] <JEEB> if the default network adapter/route that libavformat picks works, then often with UDP multicast you want to utilize -sources IP_ADDRESS
[20:11:16] <JEEB> and yea I forgot -i before the udp:// url :)

[20:16:26] <Celmor[m]> I'm trying to extract subtitles from a media file, using 'ffmpeg -i "$f.mkv" -map 0:2 "$f.srt"' I get 'Error initializing output stream 0:0 -- Subtitle encoding currently only possible from text to text or bitmap to bitmap'
[20:16:47] <JEEB> Celmor[m]: check the stream from the Input section
[20:17:00] <Celmor[m]> Stream mapping:   Stream #0:2 -> #0:0 (hdmv_pgs_subtitle (pgssub) -> subrip (srt))
[20:17:01] <JEEB> if it's dvdsub, dvbsub or pgs it is image based
[20:17:04] <JEEB> ayup
[20:17:07] <JEEB> you'd need to OCR that
[20:17:14] <JEEB> since PGS is image based
[20:17:44] <Celmor[m]> can i repack those image subtitles as is into some kind of subtitle container?
[20:18:20] <JEEB> in theory TTML might support PNG in base64, but that's kind of insane in its own right (and I didn't implement that)
[20:18:41] <Celmor[m]> I essentially want to use those subtitles for another media file
[20:18:48] <JEEB> the most common thing is that you just have a matroska file with the extension mks or so?
[20:19:00] <JEEB> only include the subtitles and do -c copy
[20:19:08] <Celmor[m]> mks?
[20:19:13] <JEEB> yea I think some people utilize taht
[20:19:24] <JEEB> and then when you match the file name and just have a different extension it would get loaded

[20:19:27] <JEEB> but eh

[20:19:55] <JEEB> write a single mkv with the subtitles included
[20:20:03] <Celmor[m]> yeah I know but I didn't want to rewrite the entire mkv I wanted to use those subs with
[20:20:07] <JEEB> yup
[20:20:12] <furq> by convention if it only has a subtitle stream it's mks
[20:20:16] <JEEB> then most likely simplest is to just have a matroska file with mks
[20:20:20] <JEEB> sup is another alternative
[20:20:23] <Celmor[m]> since then I'd have to upload the entire rewritten mkv file
[20:20:45] <Celmor[m]> are those formats compatible with other players? e.g. mpv or plex
[20:21:00] <furq> mpv understands mks
[20:21:01] <Celmor[m]> probably the former but I doubt with the latter
[20:21:03] <furq> no idea about anything else
[20:21:33] <Celmor[m]> alright, I'l look into it. thanks for the tips
[20:21:44] <JEEB> i'd guess mpv, mpc-hc, vlc etc to support it
[20:21:56] <JEEB> since I used to test mpc-hc/LAV with that stuff back in the day
[20:21:59] <JEEB> as part of my test suite
[20:23:00] <Celmor[m]> how would OCR'ing it work, can ffmpeg do it?
[20:23:54] <furq> no
[20:23:58] <JEEB> not right now, there's a patch set that might enable it, but it's kind of messy. generally you want a subtitle editor to do it
[20:24:09] <JEEB> just because OCR is generally not perfect
[20:24:11] <Celmor[m]> alright
[20:24:12] <furq> even if ffmpeg could do it you'd still want a gui editor
[20:24:17] <JEEB> you can look into something like subtitle edit
[20:24:17] <JEEB> or so
[20:24:22] <JEEB> for an example of OCR + editing
[20:25:10] <Celmor[m]> I've tried `fmpeg -i "$f.mkv" -map 0:2 -c copy "$f.mks"` but it reports '[NULL @ 0x5566d18830c0] Unable to find a suitable output format for .... invalid argument'
[20:25:39] <AMM> -f matroska
[20:25:48] <JEEB> it probably just doesn't know the extension
[20:26:06] <furq> yeah -f matroska or $f.mkv and then rename it
[20:26:10] <JEEB> yea, if you look at -h muxer=matroska
[20:26:16] <JEEB> it only lists mkv

[20:37:05] <AboimPinto> JEEB then the command should looks like this: $ ffmpeg -nostdin -threads 1 -timeout 500000 -localaddr 127.0.0.1 -i 'udp://@0.0.0.0:8554?overrun_nonfatal=1&fifo_size=50000000' -f:v mpegts -fflags nobuffer -vf format=yuv420p -f v4l2 /dev/video42
[20:37:11] <kepstin> I think even now they still use resource forks (file metadata, basically) where the application to open a file with is stored along with the file as it's saved. But there's also some fallback stuff (probably extension based) to deal with default applications for downloaded files.
[20:37:25] <AboimPinto> still have the Input/output error ..

[20:42:20] <JEEB> other than whatever your UDP stream came from no longer being in that place
[20:42:40] <JEEB> it literally just means that the UDP Stream is not there
