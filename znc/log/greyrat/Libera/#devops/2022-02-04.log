[00:01:25] <kwilczynski> It's complicated.
[00:01:30] <kwilczynski> I had a bit of an accident.
[00:01:33] <kwilczynski> Over night.
[00:01:40] <rawtaz> oh no
[00:01:45] <rawtaz> doesnt sound good
[00:03:19] <rawtaz> do you have someone to help you with whatever you need help with or is that a problem?
[00:11:33] <kwilczynski> I don't.
[00:11:43] <kwilczynski> Especially since my wife is in Japan at the moment.
[00:12:26] <rawtaz> yeah

[01:43:14] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: what was unclear? :o
[01:43:17] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: We in Poland are taught English from first grade. :) Also, I spent over a decade living in the UK.
[01:43:31] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am not sure what do you mean? :)
[01:43:47] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: let me rephrase then - is your verbal english any good? :)
[01:43:48] <rawtaz> oooh right
[01:43:55] <rawtaz> i forgOt that
[01:43:59] <rawtaz> then i suppose it's pretty awesome
[01:44:13] <kwilczynski> No.
[01:44:22] <kwilczynski> I talk like Russians in bad Hollywood movies.
[01:44:37] <kwilczynski> Making long pauses between each phrase to the added dramatic effect.
[01:45:03] <rawtaz> so thats why people fall asleep all the time when you talk

[01:58:22] <kwilczynski> Also worrying...

[02:01:13] <kwilczynski> ;]
[02:01:33] <rawtaz> hehe
[02:01:54] <kwilczynski> I've been told Norway is so rich now, they flush toilet (which is, by the way, gold plated... 24k) with crude oil.
[02:01:55] <kwilczynski> :>
[02:04:37] <kwilczynski> (a bad jab at U.S.) I wonder why Biden didn't invade Norway yet? Lutefisk surely is classified as WMD somewhere.
[02:04:37] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:05:30] <kwilczynski> (pardon me bad jokes :P)
[02:06:51] <rawtaz> dont worry, i have you on ignore by now
[02:07:02] <kwilczynski> You? :)
[02:07:19] <kwilczynski> Damn. I offended Swedish Empire.
[02:07:34] <kwilczynski> They will try to invade Poland again now.
[02:07:44] <kwilczynski> Hopefully it wouldn't work, like it didn't in the middle ages. :)
[02:07:55] <rawtaz> no need, russia will surely do that once they cross ukraine
[02:08:02] <kwilczynski> Ouch.
[02:08:04] <kwilczynski> Touche.
[02:08:07] <kwilczynski> Good point.
[02:08:15] <kwilczynski> I need to start learning my Russian.
[02:08:26] <kwilczynski> Just in case.
[02:08:40] <kwilczynski> Better to welcome new benevolent dictator in his own tongue.
[02:08:48] <kwilczynski> (also, easier than Swedish I suppose)
[02:08:49] <kwilczynski> ;p
[02:09:08] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: <3
[02:09:19] <kwilczynski> OK.
[02:09:31] <kwilczynski> So jokes and sarcasm aside.
[02:09:40] <rawtaz> lol yeah
[02:09:44] <kwilczynski> What happened over night was partially my own fault.
[02:09:56] <rawtaz> learn both and see which one is the easiest :) i think duolingo.com has both
[02:09:59] <rawtaz> let's hear it!
[02:09:59] <kwilczynski> But I reminded me of how precarious my condition is - should I forgot...
[02:10:34] <kwilczynski> When I make my medicine, I mix it and then fill a 100 ml cassette/cartridge.
[02:10:49] <kwilczynski> It so happened that it seemed to have leaked over night.
[02:10:51] <kwilczynski> When I was asleep.
[02:11:09] <kwilczynski> So I woke up around 5am short of breath. And realised what is going on.
[02:11:29] <kwilczynski> Normally, I am not allowed to go without this medicine for over 20 min.
[02:11:42] <kwilczynski> I might loose consciousness and such after the deadline.
[02:11:56] <kwilczynski> So I woke up in a bit of a startled mode.
[02:12:15] <kwilczynski> Hard to catch my breath - got myself quickly hooked to my oxygen machine.
[02:12:20] <kwilczynski> And then I realised leak happened.
[02:12:27] <kwilczynski> Sadly, I had also numb fingers.
[02:12:36] <kwilczynski> And I had to make new dose real quick.
[02:12:38] <kwilczynski> ...
[02:12:54] <kwilczynski> Normally, when my wife was here we make a week worth of supply.
[02:13:05] <kwilczynski> But since I have no patience, I tend to make one each day now.
[02:13:13] <kwilczynski> And that was, the lack of redundancy, a mistake. :)
[02:13:17] <kwilczynski> :P

[02:14:00] <kwilczynski> This whole incident reminded me how awful is to live with a terminal illness and I got depressed.
[02:14:02] <kwilczynski> The end.
[02:14:35] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: so you didnt have another one besides the leaked one? had it leaked entierly so it was empty or pretty much so?
[02:14:56] <kwilczynski> I am not sure how much leaked.
[02:14:58] <kwilczynski> It's hard to tell.
[02:15:05] <kwilczynski> But yes, I didn't have a replacement handy.
[02:15:11] <rawtaz> but somehow you felt it wasnt any point to try to use it i guess?
[02:15:12] <kwilczynski> I have spare pump and such.
[02:15:34] <kwilczynski> Use what?
[02:15:40] <rawtaz> the one that leaked a bit
[02:15:45] <kwilczynski> There is very little you can do when it ruptures.
[02:15:54] <rawtaz> ok
[02:15:56] <kwilczynski> Inside a plastic casing there is a little plastic/foil bag.
[02:16:00] <kwilczynski> Which you fill in.
[02:16:09] <kwilczynski> Once it ruptures it's gone.
[02:16:15] <rawtaz> ok
[02:16:20] <kwilczynski> It's also one time use only - as it's not sterile any more.
[02:16:40] <rawtaz> how do you manage to keep it sterile enough when mixing this stuff anyway? :o
[02:17:24] <kwilczynski> I use latex gloves and everything is sprayed with special liquid.
[02:17:34] <rawtaz> oooh ok
[02:17:35] <kwilczynski> The picture I pasted is a bad example, as I rushed today to get it done. :)
[02:17:41] <kwilczynski> Normally it's not that bad.
[02:17:51] <rawtaz> i use latex gloves as well but for totally different things that arent suitable to describe here
[02:18:14] <kwilczynski> O_o
[02:18:15] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:18:28] <rawtaz> ok so in summary you luckily managed to mix a dose despite that condition you were in at the time (although i guess the oxygen helped quite a bit) and numb fingers
[02:18:30] <kwilczynski> I won't ask!
[02:18:35] <rawtaz> that was,, seriously lucky shit that you managed..
[02:18:47] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[02:19:01] <rawtaz> im glad. i guess your wife is too, after the anger with your sloppyness in preparations settled :P
[02:19:07] <kwilczynski> There is... this slight possibility that I might have no woken up today :)
[02:19:17] <kwilczynski> She does not know yer.
[02:19:19] <kwilczynski> yet*
[02:19:28] <kwilczynski> Early morning in Japan.
[02:19:43] <rawtaz> im not sure if this is worth telling her. i mean some things just arent useful to know about
[02:19:56] <rawtaz> the important thing ha already happened, and its only with and about you
[02:20:14] <rawtaz> it might just do her more worry until you meet again, if she knows
[02:20:36] <rawtaz> im thinking she'll be worried it will happen again >_<
[02:21:02] <kwilczynski> It's kind of depressing really.
[02:21:05] <kwilczynski> I can't fix this.
[02:21:17] <kwilczynski> As (however bad) engineer.
[02:21:20] <rawtaz> you mean your illness?
[02:21:25] <kwilczynski> I have an inclination to fix things.
[02:21:27] <kwilczynski> And I can't.

[02:22:51] <rawtaz> its totally okay to feel bad about it. just dont let it ruin you, instead take that moment once in a while to feel sorry for it, then shrug it off and realize that this is only a very very short part of your long-term journey and things will be fine.
[02:23:57] <rawtaz> for all you know you could get hit by an airplane tomorrow and die. noone knows. it's simply pointless to think about these things. the only thing worth thinking about is what you do have, after all
[02:24:19] <rawtaz> but again - it's fine to feel bad and depressed once in a while. just dont get stuck in it.
[02:24:32] <rawtaz> (and yeah, i cant relate enough, i know)
[02:25:52] <rawtaz> just make sure you keep a good stock of them and never go below a certain amount of ready mixtures :)
[02:34:30] <slaughter> Damn kwilczynski that sounds scary, glad you're ok. Now go make backups of backups
[02:34:53] <rawtaz> nothing worse than people not knowing how it is to be in the situation giving advice heh :>
[02:35:47] <slaughter> Also, if you slightly modify your definition of "fix" you can definitely be qualified as fixing the situtation
[02:35:47] <slaughter> Definition of fix - transitive verb - 1a : to make firm, stable, or stationary
[02:36:09] <slaughter> rawtaz yeah I don't like doing it but I think the redundancy as he called out is a fair bit of advice :p
