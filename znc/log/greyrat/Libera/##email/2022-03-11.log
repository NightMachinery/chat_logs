[12:02:34] <sepulchralDrake_> Morning - i try to figure out why a mail i test with appmaildev.com states shows up DKIM-Result: none (no signature) but the domain sending it got a DKIM entry and the MTA is adding the field to the header

[16:53:13] <rob0> merpaderp: spam@ might not be the best localpart name for a honeypot
[16:53:29] <rob0> some spammers might be filtering such a name
[16:54:19] <merpaderp> totallynotspam@domain then?
[16:54:51] <lunaphyte> it needs to be an address that just looks "normal"
[16:55:13] <merpaderp> so the bad idea of using my own domain for that is that other names will be tried on same domain?
[16:55:22] <rob0> that string also includes "spam" btw
[16:56:34] <Khepra> I have a net of 27k+ email addresses scattered about that many web pages. they're all names from a dictionary with a number at the end, across ~80 domains
[16:57:01] <merpaderp> is that all for spam?
[16:57:14] <Khepra> yes
[16:57:29] <merpaderp> and how do you made them public, accidentally, so they get steady stream of traffic?
[16:58:29] <Khepra> <a href="mailto:..."></a>    then javascript blocked to be unclickable, and those pages have robots.txt blocks
[16:59:21] <merpaderp> so bot looks up robots.txt, visits certain page and there are bunch of mailto, probably even dynamically generated
[16:59:38] <Khepra> they don't even look up robots.txt; robots.txt is to prevent good bots from indexing
[17:00:20] <merpaderp> well that is smart, I imagine scrapers will instantly get that info and then leak it in every direction
[17:01:13] <Khepra> yeah. projecthoneypot iirc also helps with IP blocklists you can use to deny scrapers too. I'm no longer part of the project, and I don't care who or what scraped it. only who or what sends the email, and it's all fed to bayes
[17:02:02] <merpaderp> okay, so I will build similar system, thanks for input
[17:02:05] <Khepra> (along with regular email, ham, and SA bayes autolearn). I try to keep ham/spam in balance, but I feed it a it more spam due to the honeypots

[18:24:33] <merpaderp> anyone has some nice list of postfwd rules I could apply to my postfix handling personal email?
[18:24:48] <merpaderp> just fixed a rule to allow 10 per minute incoming from single sender
[18:26:43] <colo> merpaderp, a "nice list of rules" to achieve what? I enjoy virtually perfect spam protection with/from postscreen querying a number of DNSRBLs alone.
[18:29:36] <Khepra> as a balance equating side-note, I don't even use postscreen :)
[18:31:29] <merpaderp> I was talking about postfwd
[18:31:55] <Khepra> as a balance equating side-note, I don't even use postfwd :)
[18:32:23] <merpaderp> that means anyone can send you emails over and over until your mailbox is full?
[18:33:24] <Khepra> technially yes, but if those emails are spam, then no.
[18:34:11] <colo> they will have a lot of work to put in to fill the disk on my server
[18:34:55] <merpaderp> they wont, computer will do the actual work
[18:35:58] <Khepra> if anyone wanted to cram up (as a form of DoS) any of the inboxes oh the server, they can do so easily regardless of any postscreen or postfwd
[18:36:27] <merpaderp> how so?
[18:36:38] <Khepra> distributed
[18:36:42] <colo> merpaderp, I've been self-hosting my mail since 2008, and I've been postmaster for a small but popular company for 8 years. not once have I seen an attempt made to fill someone's inbox to the brim as any kind of attack. not even as an accident/honest mistake.
[18:37:04] <Khepra> colo: same here, almost the same year even :)
[18:37:18] <Khepra> today I maintain hundreds of inboxes for over 80+ domains and companies. 
[18:37:40] *** Joins: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal)
[18:38:22] <Khepra> there are many ways you could be (D)DoS'd . 
[18:39:04] <merpaderp> like?
[18:40:15] <colo> volumetric attacks, synflooding, slowloris-style L7 attacks, ...
[18:40:22] <Khepra> attacks across entire OSI stack. floods of all kids, from tcp..... yeah that
[18:40:25] <merpaderp> so you never had an issue with any of your hundreds of accounts being compromised and sending out spam?
[18:40:31] <colo> both most common and most dangeros, in my experience, are the first kind
[18:40:45] <merpaderp> but I am talking about postfwd here to protect in/out emails, why are you telling me about network related attacks
[18:41:14] <colo> I am telling you about the ways you can expect to get DDoSed on the Internet today
[18:41:26] <merpaderp> I am very well aware of those thanks, now postfwd
[18:41:28] <Khepra> also... people DoS themselves no problem. do you know #1 response I get from GMail NOQUEUEs?   "452-4.2.2 The email account that you tried to reach is over quota."
[18:41:51] <merpaderp> have seen that error line way too often
[18:41:53] * colo signing off
[18:42:37] <Khepra> merpaderp: you're using "but" to connect two vastly different sentences.  one is inbound email, and now you'r asking about outbound spam? yes, I've had accounts compromised. Those are caught within hours and SASL locked.
[18:43:00] <merpaderp> so, you are not using postfwd to catch that?
[18:43:08] <Khepra> no
[18:43:13] <Khepra> I'm using spamassassin
[18:43:23] <Khepra> and statistical monitoring of outbound email
[18:43:37] <merpaderp> is that part of spamassassin or something else entirely?
[18:44:13] <Khepra> a custom solution, part of am in-house system that also links SA after-queue with pre-queue policy rejecting IPs found spamming.
