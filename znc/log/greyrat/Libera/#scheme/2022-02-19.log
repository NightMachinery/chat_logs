[00:00:53] <amazigh> I remember when microsoft opened their AI on twitter I tried to play games with it / her. A couple of message later, not even 30 minutes, it was slow to respond, she told me "I do not want to speak with you anymore."
[00:01:39] <amazigh> btw siry won't disclose to you the schematic of its positronic brain :>
[00:01:42] <amazigh> siri
[00:02:34] <amazigh> that suggest it has positronic brain...
[00:03:26] <gwatt> training AIs on random, unsupervised chats has historically had interesting and awful results.
[00:03:45] <amazigh> that was the biggest failure imo of all the time of ai (i know)
[00:03:56] <amazigh> that = the microsoft ai on twitter.
[00:04:18] <amazigh> it was shutdown pretty quickly
[00:05:17] <amazigh> I can't imagine engineering willing to let the ai go open without a warning to the hierarchyy
[00:08:20] <amazigh> the microsoft ai learned on twitter on-the-fly, also it had no safe-guards.
[00:08:20] <gwatt> AFAIK at the time it was mostly a publicity stunt and not intended to be a "real" product
[00:09:02] <amazigh> knowing how wild twitter can be, it is hard to imagine they were no safe-guard except under the pressur to release something.
[00:09:31] <amazigh> I was wondering whether microsoft was aiming for a good OR bad buzz OR both.

[08:55:28] *** Quits: m455 (~m455@user/m455) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[08:55:47] <klf> If a language like Scheme uses S-expressions, I come to wonder why an expression like (x1, x2, x3, ...) is valid.  If we follow the structure (syntax) as described at the above link, shouldn't they be nested with brackets?  E.g. (x1, ((x2, x3), x4))
[08:57:30] <klf> I hope my example helps illustrate what I am trying to get at.
[08:58:13] <aeth> where are you getting the , from?
[08:58:45] <klf> oh crap....  the commas should not be there.
[08:59:03] <klf> (x1 ((x2 x3) x4))
[08:59:14] <aeth> usually the , is unquote as a prefix inside of a quasiquote and is of the form `(,a ,b ,c) where that basically says "treat it like '(a b c) except fill in a b c as variables" not too unlike an HTML templating language
[09:00:14] <aeth> (x1 x2 x3 x4) without any kind of quoting usually (macros can make it mean anything) means x1(x2, x3, x4) in "normal" syntax
[09:00:44] <klf> I am not talking about unqote or quasiquote here.  Just s-expressions.  again, I totally messed up by including commas.Please pretend they aren't there.
[09:00:53] <aeth> (x1 ((x2 x3) x4)) would be something like x1((x2(x3))(x4))
[09:01:11] <aeth> I probably messed that up because it's way more confusing without s-expressions

[09:02:47] <klf> 'means x1(x2, x3, x4) in "normal" syntax' sure.  Let's go with that then.
[09:04:06] <klf> What I was trying to get at is that, following the description of s-expression here (https://imgur.com/a/eIJINbj) an expression like (x1 x2 x3 x 4) is not valid
[09:04:18] <aeth> that's not a good textbook
[09:04:19] <aeth> iirc
[09:04:45] <aeth> If it's the textbook I'm thinking of, its treatment of Lisp/Scheme isn't very good. Usually doesn't help when it calls it LISP like it's the '80s
[09:05:31] <aeth> The proper definition of s-expressions should obviously allow for arbitrary length functions because that's the main advantage to forcing parentheses
[09:05:54] <aeth> If you can't do (+ 1 2 3) then you might as well use Polish notation (Reverse Polish Notation is fairly common, e.g. 1 2 + 3 +)

[09:08:33] <klf> "The proper definition of s-expressions should obviously allow for arbitrary length functions because ...", ah... thank you.
[09:08:37] <aeth> which should be bulletproof. Of course, you could come up with a toy grammar that at least allows for (f x y z) instead of just (f x)
[09:08:56] <aeth> https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf
[09:09:40] <aeth> The actual formal definition to Scheme's standard s-expression syntax is starting on page 61 of the PDF, §7.1
[09:10:08] <aeth> Other Lisps will vary. There's even an rfc s-expression which differs a bit
[09:10:55] <klf> thank you sir.
[09:10:59] <aeth> you're welcome
[09:12:28] <klf> My next question has to do with a very short (3-page) reading on Lambda Calculus (https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/CS201S08/lambda.pdf)
[09:13:06] <aeth> technically speaking, you don't need (f x y z) and could just do (((f x) y) z) with currying and maybe that's what that slide/book is going for. That's not how Lisp/Scheme actually does it, though.
[09:13:19] <aeth> Then (f x y z) could be some form of syntactic sugar on top
[09:13:48] <aeth> confusingly, it could also be (((f z) y) x)
[09:14:32] <klf> The only reduction rule of interest in this course is called beta-reduction, and is defined by: (λx. e1) e2 ⇒ e1[e2/x], where the notation e1[e2/x] denotes the result of substituting e2 for all free occurrences of x in e1.
[09:15:31] <klf> That description makes sense to me ONLY if the author leaves out the word "free"
[09:16:16] <klf> b/c there are no **free** occurrences of x in e1.
[09:18:01] <klf> If we are talking about (λx. e1), every x in e1 is bound

[09:22:32] <klf> I mean all the examples that follow make sense.  Is it possible that the author made a mistake by call them "free occurences"?
[09:23:10] <aeth> Possibly... I haven't had to deal with this sort of thing in years.
[09:23:12] <klf> So I think "... the notation e1[e2/x] denotes the result of substituting e2 for all occurrences of x in e1." is just fine.
[09:26:09] <klf> I am about to write a simple parser in PLY and so I'd like to review some basics before I do so. :-)

[09:29:17] <aeth> Your second question is more of a theoretical computer science question, so maybe ##math or #proglangdesign would be able to help if someone else in here doesn't come along with the answer.
[09:29:42] <aeth> I don't think Lispers/Schemers spend too much time thinking about parsers because the whole point of a Lisp is that it makes the parser part of the implementation trivial.
[09:30:09] <aeth> As for parsing s-expressions in general, it's easier than you think.
[09:32:25] <aeth> I think it's normally done via a manually written recursive descent parser (especially Scheme, Scheme loves recursion) rather than lexx/yacc (which PLY seems to be a clone of)

[16:11:31] <amazigh> An interesting thread started on srfi-discuss by dpk: Informal proposal: a null value for Scheme, at https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-discuss/msg/18975290/
[16:12:34] *** Quits: catonano (~catonano@net-109-116-91-254.cust.vodafonedsl.it) (Quit: catonano)
[16:13:59] <amazigh> I share this idea so that I can peacefully forget about it, and focus on babelia:
[16:14:39] <wasamasa> there's the sql-null egg
[16:14:48] <sham1> Don't we already have a null value?
[16:15:25] <wasamasa> which comes with a small API
[16:16:05] <amazigh> re scheme-live, I can't say it is failure per se, because it is soon; the scope of the project is too large, and we are missing creds and manpower; an alternative approach to push scheme forward could be to follow closely the srfi process, and provide continuous integration to *existing* and future SRFIs.
[16:17:37] <amazigh> I already asked the SRFI editor about it, Arthur declined the proposal.

[16:22:18] <amazigh> imo having libraries without tests (highly recommended by SRFI process, and most of the time they are tests), still we are missing a way to make sure the tests run on several implementations, what people do is fork a SRFI code, it is a waste, because we may be missing on a lot of improvements.
