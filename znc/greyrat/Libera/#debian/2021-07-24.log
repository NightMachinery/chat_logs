Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.

[04:01:08] <sney> that's bookworm
[04:01:18] <sney> bullseye is next month-ish
[04:01:28] <Marz> seems like buster was just recent
[04:01:43] <sney> 2019 does feel like it was last week, or 10 years ago
[04:02:17] <Marz> damn
[04:02:25] <PMT> time is an illusion
[04:02:30] <Marz> google says bullseye release date is today 
[04:02:33] <Kays> 2020 never happened (at least for me) so it's only been 1y since buster released
[04:03:04] <PMT> google says august 14th when I just tried "bullseye release date"
[04:04:00] <Marz> yes I see
[04:04:16] <Marz> so I guess some people already updated to it 
[04:04:19] <PMT> I'm curious what you searched that produced otherwise?
[04:04:35] <Marz> it is how google displayed the result
[04:04:57] <Marz> it is actually bing
[04:04:57] <sney> it was previously quasi-announced as the 31st, but today wasn't a significant date at all iirc

[13:07:01] <cousin_luigi> Greetings.
[13:12:02] <RhinosF1> Hi
[13:12:57] <cousin_luigi> Do I really have to switch to nftables?
[13:13:04] <cousin_luigi> With bullseye, I mean.
[13:13:42] <randall> cousin_luigi: AFAIK iptables compatibility layers are still there.
[13:14:08] <cousin_luigi> I see.
[13:15:44] <rudi_s> cousin_luigi: Yes. You can either use the iptables-"frontend" (which uses nftables in the background but provides the same CLI interface) or you can use the "real" iptables commands (provided by /usr/sbin/xtables-legacy-multi).
[13:16:08] <cousin_luigi> Is it recommended that I switch to nft?
[13:16:13] <rudi_s> Which is the same as in Buster.
[13:16:54] <rudi_s> Different people will most likely give different recommendations. I don't see any reason to switch to nft for existing setups and continue to use the legacy-iptables commands which don't use nft on most of my hosts.
[13:17:22] <rudi_s> For new setups I think nft is a good idea because it seems to be the path forward and it has some nice features.
[13:18:03] <cousin_luigi> Is one supposed to do things in a different way with nft?
[13:18:04] <rudi_s> But if you're used to iptables I don't see a reason to switch.
[13:18:46] <rudi_s> It's quite similar but has some different concepts so you need to learn them.
[13:20:20] <cousin_luigi> rudi_s: My configuration is rather simple. I have a number of natted ports on my single public IP to my internal addresses. Right now it's a prerouting rule and a forward one. Does nft handle that differently?
[13:21:18] *** Quits: DsszzD (~DsszzD@2409:4060:290:1509::23ae:f0ad) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:21:21] <rudi_s> cousin_luigi: No, it's basically the same (prerouting, nat, forward, etc.). But nft's arranges them in a slightly different way.

[13:21:47] <cousin_luigi> rudi_s: Does the translate tool usually do a good job with simple stuff like that?
[13:21:52] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[13:22:01] <rudi_s> No idea, never used it.
[13:22:03] <cousin_luigi> Or will I need to rework things manually?
[13:22:04] <cousin_luigi> Oh
[13:22:35] <rudi_s> I prefer to do that manually so I can learn the concepts of the new tool and might learn better implementations.
[13:22:45] <rudi_s> If you just want to use the existing setup, why switch to nft?
[13:23:06] *** Joins: Intelo (~Intelo@88.244.89.240)
[13:23:18] <rudi_s> Just use iptables and be happy. There won't be any need to switch anyway with the iptables-frontend to nft which will be available "forever".
[13:24:38] <cousin_luigi> oh, in that case
[13:24:50] <cousin_luigi> But what is it that nft does better?
[13:25:49] <rudi_s> It uses a more flexible implementation (in the kernel) which means it can be easier extended without having to modify the kernel. So many new features can be implemented in the user-space alone.
[13:26:05] <rudi_s> Also its syntax is different which some people like (I don't).
[13:26:38] <rudi_s> And it has some additional features like sets, maps, etc. which are either not available in iptables, less efficient or require extesions.

[14:31:29] <xx> ah, yes, thanks
[14:31:55] <dob1> Khepra, I prefer a more "light" directory comparision, size and mod timestamp
[14:32:26] <dob1> it's 900GB directory, file comparision by content will take too much
[14:32:40] <Khepra> dob1: by default with -r and directories given as params, it will compare contents. -u for nice unified diff view. -q to just show differing files, without unified diff view
[14:32:42] <rudi_s> rsync -a -n --delete should do it, but maybe you need some more options. Just don't forget the -n !
[14:33:05] <dob1> I will take a look
[14:33:44] <rudi_s> An alternative is find with -printf which prints the path, mtime and size and diff the result.
[14:33:44] <Khepra> dob1: well I'm just saying diff can be used too and even show actual differences, recursively on compared directories, if that use case suits you.   for rsync, what are you expecting it would check? without --checksum it'll only show timestamp and size differences, ++new files and --missing files, in target dir, compared to src
[14:34:05] <rudi_s> E.g. diff <(find old ...) <(find new ...)
[14:34:45] <dob1> Khepra, as content you mean directory content (files in the directory) or file content?
[14:35:01] <Khepra> file content
[14:35:09] <dob1> it will take too much 
[14:35:41] <dob1> it would be better, but I can't run it
[14:37:00] <Khepra> it all depends on what you _actual_ end  goal is.   just find which files from src are missing in dest? and which in dest are not in src?  or which files both in src and dest actually differ?
[14:37:46] <dob1> yes and if the file is in src and in dest is the same with the same I mean a "light" file comparision, size and timestamp
[14:38:26] <Khepra> thats what rsync does without --checksum
[14:38:58] <dob1> ok I will use it then
[14:39:10] <Khepra> rsync -a -v -n -i --delete   would show all that. > new files (in src but not in dest), -- deleted files (in dest but not in src), and m(odified) (both src and dest, differing in timestamp and/or size)

[15:12:13] <jelly> moha, ntp does not care about your time zone.  Timezones are for puny humans.
[15:12:40] <Khepra> moha: also, ntp doesn't say anything. ntp only adjusts the local time tracking. when a program asks for time, it doesn't talk to ntp at all
[15:12:50] *** Joins: amacater (~amacater@77.97.174.253)
[15:13:05] <jelly> linux clock always works with UTC; sometimes the hardware clock is in local timezone but that's best avoided
[15:13:07] <Khepra> "local time tracking" I mean hwclock, not "local" as in "local time zone", though it could be configured to set hwclock in localtz
[15:15:01] <jelly> an ntp server will always serve UTC as well; timezone is just a way to show the time stamp closer to what a human user expects and understand

[15:16:35] <moha> Ah, thanks
[15:16:45] <Khepra> jelly: with the exception of that bit where hwclock can be set in localtz value
[15:16:59] <moha> "it doesn't talk to ntp at all"
[15:17:13] <jelly> Khepra, if that affects your ntp server, then your ntp server is broken
[15:17:29] <moha> khepra: so how does the client set its time? asking from who?
[15:17:41] <Khepra> moha: ntp sets the hwclock. 
[15:17:52] <jelly> ntp client* sets...
[15:17:58] <Khepra> yes
[15:18:14] <Khepra> oh hell...  I missd the part where ntp _server_ is in the question.  sorry for the noise.
[15:19:01] <jelly> to make things more confusing, ntp client and ntp server are often the same piece of software
[15:20:26] <Khepra> moha: so to partially revert the potential confusion I did, thinking your'e asking about ntp client ... what jelly said is all correct, it's serving UTC time and should NOT do anything other than that.  it's individual clients that then store UTC into hwclock, and theprograms ask the OS what time it is and the glic layers convert hwclock UTC into configured timezone, when giving time to the asking program.
[15:20:51] <Khepra> *glibc
[15:22:45] <jelly> (there's some conflation of linux (kernel) clock and hwclock functions in your line but I'll try to stay quiet.  Oh snap)

[15:25:43] <jelly> There are machines without a real time clock (hwclock) that manage to keep time pretty well while they're powered on.  hwclock is really only important to keep time when a machine goes to sleep, is powered off, or can't connect to an authoritative ntp server.

[15:27:19] <Khepra> after solving all the catch-22 situations where you have no tls without correct time and no correct time without tls :)))
[15:29:40] <jelly> so a local ntp service doesn't really try to sync hwclock all the time even when it exists; it's only really important to do that before sleep, shutdown or reboot
[15:32:28] <Khepra> you're right, the kernel doesn't passthrough directly to hwclock.

[21:19:43] <dob1> I can use ncdu too
[21:20:26] <PMT> I'd be more curious about what I suggested first, really.
[21:20:47] <dob1> PMT, sorry which one?
[21:20:56] <PMT> 12:48 < PMT> You could also examine du -sh --apparent-size
[21:21:13] <dob1> 4.8T
[21:21:26] <PMT> yeah sounds like you might need rsync -S in your life
[21:21:42] <Khepra> that's some serious overselling of space there :)
[21:22:04] <dob1> can you explain me this in simple terms?
[21:22:24] <dob1> it's because there is unused spaces ?
[21:22:30] <Khepra> you have files that are 5x more in logical size than size on disk due to sparse blocks. 
[21:22:53] <Khepra> sparse blocks are cheating. they don't occupy actual bits on disk, just report "ho kay, this region is now, pfft, gazillion terabytes".
[21:23:51] <dob1> I never hit a problem like this
[21:23:56] <dob1> why this happened?
[21:24:04] <PMT> Sparse files are a pretty common thing for, say, VM images.
[21:24:14] <dob1> infact the are virtualbox images
[21:24:14] <PMT> (Also plenty of other cases, but that one's common.)
[21:25:00] <PMT> VirtualBox's disk image format, AFAIK, actually grows and shrinks ondisk, not uses sparse files, so that's more surprising.
[21:25:02] <dob1> so when it's copying what will happen? it will copy the "false" file?
[21:25:30] <Khepra> and that's "overselling" of space. as you actually start occupying all that space on disk, at some pont your VMs will see a theoretically impossible situation: being out of space with reported disk sizes much bigger than actually used
[21:26:01] <dob1> and how do you fix this?
[21:26:12] <PMT> How do you define fixing it?
[21:26:39] <dob1> to have the size reported as it is
[21:26:43] <dob1> not a fake number
[21:26:52] <PMT> the number reported is correct.
[21:27:37] <PMT> rsync is telling you "if I copy this how you told me, it'll copy 5 TB". du is telling you "this takes up this much space on disk".

[21:28:35] <PMT> I meant what I said.
[21:28:36] <dob1> I thank you for the infos but too be honest I am still a bit confused
[21:29:00] <SymbioticFemale> amacater: too many choices. when i have too many choices, i'm going to end up with 2008 thinkpads and no upgrade.
[21:29:13] <dob1> PMT, why rsync will copy 5tb ? I don't understand this
[21:29:26] <Khepra> dob1: okay, take one disk image as example. you create it and define it's 5TB in size. it's a file that declares 5TB but actually uses 0 on disk initially
[21:29:32] <dob1> and where did it "find" the data that doesn't exists
[21:29:49] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: enable compression? rsync would compress that disk into 0
[21:29:49] <Khepra> as you start filling it in (VM installs etc...) it's actual, used size on disk starts to grow
[21:30:17] <Khepra> so teh discrepancy here is in logical size vs actual bits on the disk platters
[21:30:19] <PMT> dob1: you can have a file and say "it's 40 GB but don't actually take up space on disk until I write things to those parts, just pretend all those parts are all zeroes if someone asks". 
[21:30:29] <SymbioticFemale> compression is teh answer

[21:30:47] <PMT> dob1: so if something tries to read those files without trying to look for that, it will see much more data than you're actually using on disk.

[21:31:09] <PMT> dob1: similar concept.
[21:31:09] <dob1> *from what
[21:31:47] <dob1> so it's the vm disk definition that is wrong? 
[21:31:57] <PMT> Nothing is wrong, just your expectations.
