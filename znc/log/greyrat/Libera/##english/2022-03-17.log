[06:46:17] <xau> Shlomi Fish is also a good Jewish name, rindolf.
[06:48:03] <xau> Shlomo (how the name "Solomon" sounds in Hebrew), plus a long E suffix is an informal version.  Like Pete for Peter or Dave for David.
[06:48:27] <xau> This has been your Hebrew moment (as today is a Jewish Holiday) -- Purim.
[06:49:01] <twb> xau: "diminuitive"
[06:49:19] <xau> https://www.shlomifish.org/personal.html
[06:51:14] <xau> Yes that's the formal name for that type of word.  
[06:51:48] <xau> Diminutive names typically signify intimacy and or informality.
[06:52:22] <amigojapan> xau: I wish I had a good Jewish name too, my name sounds arabic, but it is just a mde up name, at least my last name is Jewish altho not common
[06:52:50] <amigojapan> my mom made up my name

[06:53:22] <amigojapan> or my middle name?

[06:53:33] <amigojapan> my middle name is just a common Mexican name
[06:53:34] <twb> They're not rationed
[06:53:45] <amigojapan> hmmm
[06:53:56] <amigojapan> twb: I guess i could legally change my name,, yes
[06:54:04] <amigojapan> but that owuld be a lot of paper work
[06:54:05] <twb> You can also change your legal name for about $50 about once every 3 months, IIRC
[06:54:15] <twb> It's not hard, at least not here
[06:54:17] <rindolf> xau: i know
[06:54:21] <amigojapan> that depends on country
[06:55:02] <xau> I've had one of my middle names redacted from a passport in order to maintain consistency among documents.
[06:55:23] <xau> That didn't require a special form because it was deemed to be "minor".

[19:08:11] <furrykef> GuiToris: Arnold has said he keeps his accent deliberately because it's so iconic
[19:08:14] <pussipupu> Though people understand me
[19:08:46] <pussipupu> Personally I like variety so I've always enjoyed it when people don't flatten their accent to the local average too much
[19:09:30] <GuiToris> furrykef, and I do the exact opposite, try to conceal it, so nobody notice I'm not native

[19:15:31] <furrykef> I've also heard that his accent is still fairly distinct even in Austria; it's a very particular region of Austria
[19:16:11] <GuiToris> I guess because he left the country early

[19:20:33] <GuiToris> I'll check Bugs Bunny out
[19:20:41] <furrykef> I think "dah-tah" is more etymologically justifiable, since the vowel was short in Latin, but people don't really care about such details
[19:21:26] <furrykef> I should add Bugs Bunny's voice was created in 1940... the real-life accents have probably shifted considerably since then

[21:45:34] <huf> you can use various tricks to make more vowels
[21:45:51] <huf> the real problem is, each dialect has a different set (and number) of vowels :D

[22:00:24] <huf> damn and now you've reminded me of fischerspooner, i know i used to like at least one song of theirs
[22:00:27] <huf> but i cant remember anything more about it
[22:02:10] <pussipupu> do we count diphthongs when we're pretending vowels are countable?
[22:02:27] <huf> they're not countable?
[22:02:57] <huf> I think we can count them at least two ways
[22:03:06] <pussipupu> well, they're not really discrete
[22:03:53] <pussipupu> Finnish has eight letters for vowels
[22:05:02] <huf> it also has the doubling
[22:06:17] <pussipupu> yeah but I don't know if long vowels are generally counted as different vowels from short ones
[22:06:23] <huf> ah
[22:06:26] <pussipupu> or if it's just qualities that count
[22:06:29] <huf> here they're definitely counted entirely separately
[22:07:01] <huf> 'Ã¡' is not a modified 'a' in any sense except the actual glyph
[22:07:01] <pussipupu> Don't you have three vowel lengths too?
[22:07:06] <huf> just two
[22:07:09] <huf> that's estonian IIRC
[22:07:28] <pussipupu> Prolly, it's one of the cousins at least
[22:07:43] <huf> oh and of course that Ã¡ is the long pair of a, but of course the difference is a lot more than just length :)
[22:08:29] <huf> hmm, the doubled ones are not in the alphabet
[22:08:39] <huf> so maybe finnish thought doesnt consider them separate vowels
[22:09:03] <LjL> every phoneme except like one or two can be made long (or "doubled" if you like) in Finnish
[22:09:18] <huf> same here
[22:09:18] <LjL> so it's reasonable to say the phonemes are only the single ones and when you double them it's phonemically two of them
[22:09:20] <bin> yes I was making a joke that US and UK have the same vowels
[22:09:24] <bin> er woops, 
[22:09:26] <bin> scrolled up
[22:09:29] <huf> and still the long vowels are counted separate
[22:09:32] <huf> the long consonants arent :)
[22:09:52] <huf> i guess maybe because the long vowels have such different qualities from their short pairs
[22:09:58] <LjL> but this is all a matter of phonological analysis, meaning, for the same language, you will often find different linguists analyzing it in different ways. for each of them, vowels will be countable quite precisely, but they may not be the same number as another analysis
[22:09:59] <huf> especially Ã¡ and Ã©
[22:10:07] <huf> yeah
[22:10:32] <huf> i read a thing where someone was trying to figure out if it's useful to count 'au' as a phoneme in .hu
[22:10:41] <LjL> huf, but you said with Ã¡ the difference "is a lot more than just length". i don't know anything about Hungarian, but if you mean the vowel *quality* is different, then it becomes harder to just count it as two /a/'s
[22:10:49] <huf> i think the result was that yeah it's a separate vowel phoneme but it's not particularly useful to treat it as such :)
[22:10:56] <LjL> in Finnish, the vowel quality doesn't change beyond some natural allophony
[22:10:58] <huf> LjL: yeah
[22:11:01] <pussipupu> LjL: off hand all can be long but I think at least one can't be short
[22:11:14] <pussipupu> hmm, I guess it can but not in isolation
[22:12:03] <LjL> pussipupu, i was likely thinking of "A double /h/ is rare in standard Finnish, but possible, e.g. hihhuli, a derogatory term for a religious fanatic. In some dialects, e.g. Savo, it is common: rahhoo, or standard Finnish rahaa 'money' (in the partitive case). The distinction between /d/ and /dd/ is found only in foreign words; natively 'd' occurs only in the short form."
[22:12:28] <huf> LjL: Ã¡ and Ã© have moved so far from a/e that there are now long versions of a and e (not written, only happens in certain spots as a thingie. reaction to the surrounding sounds)

[22:15:04] <huf> how does that even happen tho, having tt but not dd
[22:15:21] <pussipupu> ah yeah, but h is always a little weirdo
[22:16:38] <huf> finnish isnt all that into voiced consonants, is it...
[22:16:54] <huf> you can have a little as a treat
[22:17:25] <LjL> huf, they barely have /d/ in the first place, it's kind of an outlier, they don't natively have /b/ and /g/, so in other words they "originally" lacked the entire series of voiced plosives. /d/ is sometimes pronounced [Ã°] and sometimes as a flap [É¾] and the actual pronunciation [d] is kinda more common when you're making an effort to speak in a standard register

[23:30:40] <blkshp> It's a shrug
[23:30:56] <Rashad> no a shrug is when you don't know so you raise your shoulders 
[23:31:05] <blkshp> Precusely, that's what that is
[23:31:34] <Rashad> no I am talking when you are scared or surprised you swallow your saliva 
[23:31:46] <Rashad> shocked maybe not surprised 
[23:31:57] <blkshp> I dont think there's a word for it. Gulp perhaps
[23:32:43] <Rashad> gulp! 
[23:32:46] <Rashad> yes maybe

[23:34:18] <Rashad> blkshp did you see the guy on youtube who turned cotton into cotton candy? 
[23:34:26] <TimMc> Nile Red?
[23:34:31] <Rashad> yes
[23:34:40] <TimMc> badly :-P
[23:34:47] <huf> something like this happened in catch 22 too... :)
[23:35:09] <huf> chocolate coated cotton IIRC
[23:35:12] <TimMc> He decomposed the cellulose into sugars, but they didn't work out well in the cotton candy machine.
[23:35:12] <Rashad> badly?
[23:35:32] <Rashad> TimMc they worked well /enough/
[23:35:35] <TimMc> heh
[23:35:53] <TimMc> It was impressive that it worked at all, yes. :-)
[23:35:57] <Rashad> it was edible and sugary and delicious  
[23:36:01] <Rashad> yes yes
[23:36:03] <blkshp> We call it "Candy floss"
[23:36:39] <Rashad> what
[23:36:46] <blkshp> Cotton candy
[23:36:51] <Rashad> wow that's real I checked 
[23:36:58] <Rashad> blkshp who is "we"?
[23:37:03] <blkshp> Well i'm not generally a liar! 
[23:37:05] <blkshp> The British
[23:37:09] <Rashad> wow
[23:37:18] <Rashad> we call it girls' hair
[23:37:35] <TimMc> ew
[23:37:54] <TimMc> Although I suppose "cotton candy" isn't all that appetizing a name either.
[23:38:19] <GuiToris> what does this mean? donâ€™t get caught up over an enthusiastic response.
[23:41:35] <blkshp> depends on what it is
[23:43:04] <GuiToris> :/
[23:45:07] <GuiToris> My friend doesn't get along with a girl, and I read this because of him : 'When you attention to her and she doesnâ€™t deserve it, donâ€™t get caught up over an enthusiastic response.'
[23:45:14] <GuiToris> Does this make more sense now?
[23:45:46] <blkshp> Not really. Maybe my brain is just too cold-ridden
[23:46:22] <TimMc> "When you attention to her" is missing a word or two.
