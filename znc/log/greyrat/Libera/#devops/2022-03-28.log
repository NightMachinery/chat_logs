[18:27:12] <dubiousness> merpader1: you might find Otto interesting (Hashicorp) before it was abandoned.
[18:28:52] <dubiousness> It was a good idea, but poorly received and Vagrant simply stuck around
[18:30:35] <rawtaz> merpader1: waht do you even mean, what does "virtualization in yaml management" mean? you mean basically what docker-compose is but for virtualization instead of containerization i guess?
[18:30:43] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)
[18:33:16] <merpader1> yeah
[18:33:28] <merpader1> I am learning ansible in last weeks and so far everything goes smooth
[18:33:34] <merpader1> except annoying jinja2 templating
[18:34:07] <rawtaz> yeah..
[18:34:22] <rawtaz> i actually found a format that was good and pleasant the other month, but i forgot what it was named
[18:34:29] <rawtaz> i dont like yaml at all :<
[18:35:16] <dubiousness> merpader1: Otto was JSON, but you cold just run it through a YAML -> JSON converter
[18:35:24] <dubiousness> Anyway, I think my point was that it's been done, it just didn't catch on.
[18:35:29] <dubiousness> Also Ansible is great, but doesn't scale well
[18:36:49] <merpader1> they are all just wrappers around different kinds of virtualization API's
[18:37:15] <rawtaz> wahts the use case? being able to specify what virtualization resources should be running, update the config and then the virtualized resources adjust accordingly?
[18:37:21] <merpader1> except maybe terraform has some magic in it in that part about defining state and achieving it, idk, just watched nana's video about it.
[18:37:25] <rawtaz> im thinking there MUST be something for that already
[18:37:36] <rawtaz> but most of them have some kind of GUI instead
[18:37:50] <dubiousness> rawtaz: for non-development infrastructure that's Terraform yes
[18:37:55] <rawtaz> tf is for infrastructure so it would work yeah. but its not really the same type of thing
[18:42:33] <shad> rawtaz: are you inventing kubernetes again ?
[18:42:57] <shad> Ansible is great, and Jinja templating ain't that bad too

[18:48:08] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[18:57:18] <merpader1> yea maybe not bad, just yet another piece of knowledge to have instead of something already existing, like idk, eval python?
[18:57:52] <merpader1> hardest part about ansible is figuring out the correct layout of playbooks, at least imho.
[18:58:25] <shad> merpader1: you should be using roles anyways
[18:59:19] <dubiousness> merpader1: admittedly, at first glance the preference rules for Ansible are confusing
[18:59:48] <shad> we do it like that at my shop: https://paste.mozilla.org/mRVdpJ1b
[19:00:49] <merpader1> and here we go, yet another way to use ansible
[19:00:52] <shad> then you have `{CWD}/playbook.yml ; {CWD}/env.yml ; {CWD}/roles/foo ...` 
[19:01:16] <shad> _this is the way_
[19:02:18] <shad> then you `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml -u your-user -kKb playbook.yml` and boom done
[19:02:21] <shad> things run smoothly
[19:03:46] <merpader1> I thought this is the way agreed to be used: github.com/ansible/ansible-examples/blob/master/tomcat-memcached-failover/site.yml
[19:04:00] <merpader1> list a host and roles to apply on it, done deal
[19:04:23] <merpader1> what kind of perverse way is to loop over things you defined in same file is anyways lol
[19:05:03] <shad> i don't define the roles in the playbook.yml, i defined them in the environment variables
[19:05:13] <shad> that way you get control over which role to run at a given time
[19:05:42] <shad> also, the method you've shown, `remote_user: root` doesn't that mean you gotta expose ssh login as root ? not halal
[19:05:54] <shad> `become: true` is what the cool kids do
[19:09:46] <dubiousness> I think the cool kids are waiting for the next not-Ansible
[19:09:52] <dubiousness> The rest of us just use what's there
[19:11:46] <shad> well, there's always Kubernetes
[19:11:50] <shad> that's a cool kid stuff
[19:13:05] <dubiousness> K8s is good, but I've still found the need for infra and a bit of Ansible here and there.
[19:13:14] <dubiousness> Like supplier-supported applications/appliances, for example.

[22:06:16] <kubblai> great i got accepted for github copilot. no i just type nonsense (no change there) but copilot will now make me apps
[22:07:30] <dubiousness> Silly software
[22:11:43] <rawtaz> hehe thats fancy
[22:11:49] <rawtaz> i heard that its pretty competent
[22:11:55] <rawtaz> (podcast on changelog)
[22:14:25] <dubiousness> Have they resolved the license violations thing yet?
[22:14:51] <dubiousness> (they may have done, been a while since i looked)
[22:15:39] <rawtaz> you mean specifically for copilot? no idea waht they were
[22:17:50] <dubiousness> as I understand it, because Copilot effectively "lifts" known code from other repositories, and those have included GPL code, using what Copilot writes for you in your application could lead to license violations
[22:18:01] <rawtaz> yeah, makes sense :)
[22:18:18] <rawtaz> one would kind of figure that they had thought of that before they released the project (even for beta)
[22:18:21] <rawtaz> :o
[22:18:38] <dubiousness> Which is especially bad if you're using it in a work setting, not sure more employers would be happy if they had to get the legal team involved because their engineers thought Copilot was "cool"
[22:19:08] <dubiousness> There appears to be a fairly comprehensive writeup by the sfc: https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/
[22:19:56] <rawtaz> i think its like any other thing you use, e.g. a library that you fork or whatever - you need to know the license, and thats it. nothing specific here really
[22:20:20] <dubiousness> yeah, I think the main problem is that it doesn't even try to do that
[22:20:56] <dubiousness> I'm not a lawyer, I leave that mess for lawyers to figure out
[22:21:26] <rawtaz> but it does boil down to a definition of hwats derivative work too.. i mean, in one sense it could be so well trained that it actually produces *new* code and not copies of code. it wouldnt be any different than other programmers who just happen to write very similar code
[22:22:38] <dubiousness> rawtaz: > We recommend users who wish to avoid infringing the copyrights of others simply avoid Copilot.
[22:22:57] <dubiousness> rawtaz: similar, and 'copied wholesale' are two very different things
[22:23:04] <rawtaz> hah nice :L)

[22:25:38] <kubblai> i better disable the plugin on my work vscode then
[22:26:12] <kubblai> back to stackoverflow to write all my code then :(
[22:26:32] <rawtaz> haha
[22:27:04] <rawtaz> hm i sooo need a split keyboard. i want one of those thats made for hands and not just a regular one thats split and perhaps slightly tilted
[22:28:09] <dubiousness> rawtaz: a friend has two ErgoDox and rates them
[22:29:31] <rawtaz> rates as in hates?
[22:29:43] <dubiousness> rawtaz: rates as in 'rates it highly;
[22:29:54] <dubiousness> He loves them
[22:30:53] <rawtaz> sweet! :)
[22:31:03] <rawtaz> ive been looking at that.. he has the older and the newer version?
[22:31:34] <kubblai> i quite like the keychron
[22:32:05] <kubblai> they do loads of options quite nice if you have multiple machines you can press a button to switch up 3 machines BT
[22:32:36] <rawtaz> what has stopped me from buying e.g. the ergodox is that i simply cant know if it fits my hands. i mean everyone has differently sized hands. i do have an older kinesis advantage 2 but i never use it because the thumb keys are too close to my wrist, and i dont want to buy an expensive one again to find out something similar :/
[22:32:51] <kubblai> i just cant justify the £80 as i have an mx keys from logitech which has the same feature but isnt mech
[22:32:57] <rawtaz> ergodoxes have a return policy but it would be very expensive to ship it back so its not really a practical option
[22:33:12] <kubblai> cant you buy from a local amazon ?
[22:33:22] <rawtaz> hm i could check :)
[22:33:37] <dubiousness> rawtaz: older I think
[22:34:20] <kubblai> rawtaz: in my day we'd have taken a picture and made it out of papermache to check ;)
[22:34:52] <kubblai> you kids these days, no imagination, get off my lawn
[22:36:44] <rawtaz> :D
[22:36:46] <rawtaz> :****
[22:37:49] <rawtaz> hm theres only a bunch of random chinese or similar "brands" selling the ergodox on the local amazon, not a single one of them has a review. doesnt exactly feel genuine lol
[22:41:06] <rawtaz> hm i dont get the point with a keychron, whats so special about it? same placement of keys as other bkds
[22:41:09] <rawtaz> kbds
[22:41:35] <rawtaz> heh exceot that enter key, i cant fathom how you guys can deal with such a small horizontal one :)
[22:43:58] <kubblai> thats what she said
[22:44:39] <kubblai> i just tried copilot to build an ec2 instance and some security groups with tf. theres a tiny delay but its pretty fucking sick
[22:47:19] <rawtaz> hahahaha
[22:47:51] <rawtaz> what did you "input" and waht did it output?
[22:48:57] <kubblai> so i just did #build an ec then it offered to tab complete ec2 instance. i then did a resource aws_instance it then chose a random amiid however it filled out all the required fields for an ec2 instance
[22:49:22] <kubblai> did the same for the sec group
[22:49:34] <rawtaz> how silly
[22:49:54] <rawtaz> so youre saying every fucking idiot in the world didnt need to spend three years learning tf properly
[22:50:09] <kubblai> a re you calling me an idiot !?!?!! :D
[22:50:36] <kubblai> well it is quite nice but you'd still need to know about the structure of tf 
[22:51:02] <kubblai> i imagine if you're calling an output or a data block it wont autofill the correct reference
[22:51:10] <kubblai> same for vars
[22:51:13] <kubblai> lemme check

[22:51:59] <rawtaz> haha
[22:53:36] <kubblai> oh nice works for vars too but im pretty sure it doesnt know where they go, i dont think its psychic
[22:53:49] <rawtaz> yeah
[22:53:55] <rawtaz> well it seems pretty cool heh
[22:53:58] <rawtaz> i would never use it though
[22:54:01] <kubblai> apply for the beta
[22:54:05] <kubblai> oh ok
[22:54:22] <rawtaz> im not sure what to do with it. i would feel bad if something else wrote my code. then i wont have any skills
[22:54:55] <kubblai> im pamnts at coding so this will help me, also instead of writing 3 lines of required params in tf i can now press tab and edit the values. which is lazy so i like it
[22:55:20] <rawtaz> youre a sloppy copy paster arent you
[22:55:27] <kubblai> indeed
[22:55:57] <kubblai> i dont even use dynamic lists coz i barely understand what a map is anyway so i copy paste new security rules into everything
[22:57:12] <rawtaz> hmm
[22:57:35] <kubblai> im not that bad i'd at least try. this guy on my team tho who thinks he's awesome rewrote the readme on a repo the other day with what he'd called a reusable code snippet. it was basically a security group rule he said you could copy and paste and edit
[23:01:07] <kubblai> no mate thats not what we meant by reusable code :(
[23:04:13] <rawtaz> lol
