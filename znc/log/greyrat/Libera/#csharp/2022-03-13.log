[00:00:05] <DoofusCanadensis> reducing nesting is fine, but when it's conditional, I'd expect it to increase complexity for people trying to understand code
[00:00:36] <xb0o2> Well, if you still want to scope it you can
[00:00:49] <xb0o2> But for the common case, reducing nesting is a good thing
[00:00:55] <DoofusCanadensis> I plan to, until I understand it better
[00:03:23] <irwiss> using statement is available even when it's not the last, it's just active for the scope it's inside
[00:03:58] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah I get that. I was just surprised to see that it could be simplified and didn't know why until I tried a few things
[00:04:48] <DoofusCanadensis> but as I said... been a while since I've touched C#
[00:05:43] <xb0o2> Have you tried writing it instead of touching it?
[00:06:02] <DoofusCanadensis> you mean you can't just touch it inapproprately until it does what you want?
[00:06:48] <xb0o2> That's correct.
[00:07:19] <DoofusCanadensis> dang
[00:07:28] <DoofusCanadensis> I'll have to unlearn that Javaism then
[00:08:19] <xb0o2> Speaking of, we have a really half-assed conversion of an Android app to Xamarin and I can't help but feel leaving it as Java would've been better.

[00:48:19] <Nasp> Not that i did either
[00:48:38] <MatthiasVance> I can totally relate. "We" hired people that weren't a fit from the start (they wouldn't listen about necessary ability to learn) and then a lot of time was spent on babysitting, not teaching, teaching is good!

[00:53:29] <Nasp> I am not a fan of two newly hired people review eachother

[03:28:27] <bpmedley> Lukky : I have a .dmg that I story my .ssh directory in.  I only have one computer that I use, so it's much easier.
[03:29:39] <Lukky> bpmedley: that's a Mac thing, right?
[03:29:50] <bpmedley> Yes, that's correct.  The .dmg is a Mac thing.
[03:29:58] <jonp> bpmedley: you store your .ssh in a dmg?!
[03:30:03] <bpmedley> jonp : Yes
[03:30:09] <jonp> wait, what?  *why*?
[03:30:31] <bpmedley> I have a symlink between .ssh and /Volumes/blah
[03:30:46] <jonp> i'm not asking *how*
[03:30:51] <jonp> that's kinda obvious ;-)
[03:31:03] <bpmedley> jonp : I had it password protected in the past, so that was a good reason.  Now I don't have a very good reason, besides historical ones.
[03:31:14] <Lukky> I was going to ask you about that... so you "mount" the .dmg, and use the symlink into it?
[03:31:21] <bpmedley> Lukky : Yes, that's correct.
[03:31:34] <Lukky> interesting
[03:31:50] <jonp> bpmedley: and a password protected .dmg, not a .sparsebundle
[03:31:58] <jonp> ‚Ä¶probably because .sparsebundle didn't exist back then?
[03:31:59] <Lukky> What does the .dmg file offer you above just a regular file?
[03:32:05] <bpmedley> open ~/ssh_dir.dmg   <-- I run this command when I reboot
[03:32:14] <jonp> bpmedley: just add the .dmg to Startup Items
[03:32:20] <jonp> should get opened as part of login then
[03:32:39] <jonp> Lukky: the .dmg *itself* can be password protected.
[03:32:40] <bpmedley> At this point, the .dmg is probably not the best way.  I don't know what a .sparsebundle is..
[03:32:43] <jonp> so 'defense in depth"
[03:33:10] <bpmedley> jonp : I had not thought of putting it in Startup items..
[03:33:16] <jonp> bpmedley: instead of a single file, a .sparse* is a directory tree full of "filesystem-like files"
[03:33:24] <Lukky> but what is a dmg... is that like some vhd file of some kind?
[03:33:27] <jonp> makes filesystem changes more efficient, means it can allocate space on demand, etc.
[03:33:43] <jonp> Lukky: it's a file that contains a filesystem
[03:33:53] <jonp> like COM Structured Storage or zip files or ISO files or‚Ä¶
[03:33:54] <Lukky> ahhh
[03:34:22] <jonp> macOS allows mounting .dmg/.iso/etc. files so that they're exposed as normal directory trees on the file system
[03:34:40] <jonp> so you can `ls` into them, create files, edit files‚Ä¶
[03:34:44] <jonp> all totally transparent
[03:34:46] <Lukky> what would be the equivalent for Windows, or even Linux?
[03:35:01] <bpmedley> Lukky : I think Linux can readily mount .iso files
[03:35:04] <jonp> i think windows had a .iso redirector at one point?
[03:35:17] <Lukky> cool...
[03:35:18] <jonp> though that may have been a commercial lib
[03:35:28] <Lukky> and the iso can be any size, right?
[03:35:59] <DoofusCanadensis> so, apply a passphrase to get to your dmg, apply a passphrase to use your key. any other passphrase layers you want to add there?
[03:36:47] <Lukky> So I create let's say a 1GB iso file, and mount it in linux, and use it to store my keys... do you have a contingency in case you lose your usb stick?
[03:37:15] <jonp> "defense in depth" often means "if i forget something, i'm fucked" ;-)
[03:37:17] <bpmedley> DoofusCanadensis : I had a password on the dmg in the past.  However, now I don't.  I sometimes wonder if should get rid of the dmg..
[03:37:24] <jonp> (not that it *needs* to mean that.  It's just often the case.)
[03:37:47] <DoofusCanadensis> I keep passphrases on my keys, but it's super easy to invalidate a key if it becomes compromised
[03:38:19] <DoofusCanadensis> so I don't feel like I need anything more than that
[03:39:38] <Lukky> I use Password Safe. Would it be "wise" to use it to store my ssh keys?

[04:48:40] <Lukky> Solar panels are equally shitty
[04:48:42] <Nasp> It also makes for insanely unstable electricity prices
[04:48:45] <Nasp> Yes
[04:49:01] <Nasp> Just go nuclear
[04:49:10] <Nasp> One plant with a few reactors and we can cover the entire country
[04:49:11] <Lukky> Why do greens insist on not using nuclear?
[04:49:15] <Nasp> And reach that 2030 goal
[04:49:15] <Lukky> Exact!!
[04:50:02] <Lukky> We must invest in fusion rather than waste money on current "green" technologies
[04:50:13] <Lukky> at the very least fission
[04:51:39] <Lukky> On a similar topic, I was watching a video about a company recycling electonic wastes, extracting more gold per ton than mining!
[04:51:56] <Lukky> gold, paladium, copper, etc
[04:52:23] <Nasp> You mean fission right
[04:52:32] <Lukky> Their process is eco-friendly. That's the kind of thing we should subsidise
[04:52:40] <Nasp> But yeah many just hate nuclear due to those few accidents
[04:52:46] <Nasp> Chernobyl, Fukushima
[04:53:01] <Nasp> But keep forgetting how many dies yearly due to fossile fuels

[04:59:18] <Nasp> Anyways we wont solve this climate crisis
[04:59:27] <Nasp> And at this point i dont really care anymore
[04:59:35] <Lukky> burning wood has its cons as well
[04:59:36] <Nasp> Let it all go to hell, i wont be around to suffer for it
[05:00:01] <Nasp> Yeah going back to 1800s would probably be worse for the climate
[05:00:17] <smitty> in reality though the population would decrease sharply
[05:00:22] <smitty> humans are bad for the planet
[05:00:25] <Lukky> producing clean energy is the challenge... I wish we could somehow harness photosynthesis to generate electricity
[05:00:56] <smitty> haven't there been like actual fusion breakthroughs recently
[05:01:05] <Lukky> the sun is not about to die, at least for for a few billion years
[05:01:07] <Nasp> Forget about fusion
[05:01:28] <Lukky> Nasp: why are you against fusion?
[05:01:33] <Nasp> Lukky:  You mean like... solar panels
[05:01:41] <Nasp> I'm not against it, just forget about it
[05:01:47] <Nasp> It's not a technolgy we have available
[05:01:53] <Lukky> Nasp: no... solar panels don't use photosynthesis
[05:01:57] <Nasp> And using it as an argument is invaid
[05:02:06] <Nasp> No they don't they use a more efficient process
[05:02:12] <Lukky> I can concede that
[05:02:26] <Lukky> I mean about fusionb
[05:02:39] <Lukky> but how are solar panels more efficient?
[05:03:48] <Lukky> What I'm dreaming of, is a bio way of harnessing photosynthesis so that it doesn't contaminate
[05:04:00] <Nasp> How much electricity does  plant produce
[05:04:06] <Lukky> No idea
[05:04:14] <Nasp> Well you could use some algue that could produe some bio fuel
[05:04:20] <Nasp> That would probably be the best way
[05:04:28] <Lukky> Yes, I've seen some docus on that
[05:04:29] <Nasp> But i still think the numbers come up short
[05:05:13] <Lukky> Whatever the solution ends up being, we must invest in finding it rather than invest on known broken ones (solar, wind)
[05:05:22] <Nasp> I still think nuclear is one of the only ways to go
[05:05:34] <Nasp> Although the number of plants when calculated worldwide sounds insane
[05:05:43] <Lukky> At the moment it's our only short term solution
[05:05:51] <Nasp> We shouldn't invest in finding it, use what's available
[05:06:17] <Lukky> Sure, but let's also think further down the road
[05:06:24] <Nasp> If you could find a more efficient way to get heat turned into electricity
[05:06:30] <Nasp> That could help a lot
[05:06:35] <Lukky> go nuclear right now, and invest in finding new sources
[05:06:46] <Nasp> All our ways of producing electricity now has an awful lot of waste
[05:06:53] <Lukky> agreed
[05:06:53] <Nasp> Yes nuclear now, found something better hopefully
[05:07:00] <Nasp> Not sure what the better part would be
[05:07:10] <Nasp> Maybe solar and batteries would become better
[05:08:26] <Lukky> in the meantime, let's stop wasting money on shitty solutions... we need oil for at least a few decades more, then transition to nuclear, and keep funcing research on other ways of harnessing the limitless source of energy that's our sun
[05:08:50] <smitty> my area still uses a lot of coal :\
[05:08:58] <Lukky> that sux

[05:09:24] <Nasp> Burning wood or coal
[05:09:40] <Lukky> Up here we're fully hydro, but it's not a clean solution... it destroys way too much land
[05:09:48] <Nasp> Norway?
[05:09:52] <Lukky> Qc
[05:09:54] <smitty> theres a lot of politics around solar right now because companies are buying huge pieces of land, putting solar panels on them, and selling all the electricity to chicago
[05:09:57] <Nasp> Ahh
[05:10:14] <Nasp> Yeah hydro has a huge impact as well, and it's actually the most dangerous way to get power
[05:10:25] <Nasp> smitty:  Yup same is happening here in DK
[05:10:40] <Nasp> You can make huge solar fields and earning theoretical profits on it not even being on the grid
[05:10:57] <Lukky> think of that huge monster of a dam they made in china about 15 years ago... the area that was flooded...
[05:11:07] <Nasp> Yes
[05:11:43] <Lukky> some villages are now 100 meters under water (some crazy number like that)
[05:15:21] <Lukky> Wow, just reading that this dam caused the earth's rotation speed as to increase the length of a day by 0.06 microseconds...
[05:15:32] <Nasp> Really?
[05:15:44] <Nasp> Yay leap seconds :D
[05:16:02] <Lukky> hehe
[05:16:20] <Nasp> Also i believe it affected millions of people
[05:16:46] <Lukky> that's crazy if you think of it... humans can change the earth's rotation speed!

[08:20:49] <maroon> im wanting to make a temp array and fill it from a diskfile, and then free its memory after i'm quickly finished with it. is this what i should do? byte [] array1 = new byte[12345678]; byte[] array1 = File.ReadAllBytes("foo.bin"); { do stuff }; array1 = null;

[08:22:54] <Andrio> maroon, if you do that, you're creating an array and then replacing it with a different array without ever doing anything with the first array. That's bad.
[08:23:09] <Andrio> File.ReadAllBytes creates a new array
[08:23:34] <maroon> ah, and the array size is determined by the diskfile size?
[08:23:58] <Andrio> Anyway, if it's just a local variable, you don't need to explicitly set it to null. The garbage collector will get it regardless. You can do that in Dispose if it's an instance field though.
[08:24:04] <Andrio> Yeah.
[08:24:36] <maroon> its not local
[08:25:30] <maroon> i've got another mirc busy trying to create the file. which means ive got a long wait :(
[08:26:54] <Andrio> ah..
[08:31:04] <maroon> i tried defining the byte array in source code, but i kept getting cryptic error messages that i assume means the .cs was too big
[08:33:30] <Andrio> Firstly, there are better ways to do that, such as using a resources file in the project settings, or reading from a file at run time as you tried. Secondly, though, what error message?

[22:35:09] <irwiss> yes
[22:35:10] <Suchiman> maroon: yes

[22:37:12] <irwiss> that's super low level to the point where it doesn't matter even in context of C
[22:37:50] <irwiss> most compilers will emit xor cause iirc it's shorter opcode
[22:37:58] <maroon> generally that's true, except when this is inside an inner loop that gets used heavily
[22:38:37] <irwiss> unless you're willing to convert your loop to isa dependent assembly you don't get this degree of control in .net, or even c
[22:40:38] <maroon> i know lots of compilers look for things to optimize. like how there isnt a circulur totate operation, but they'd recognize "var << 4 || var >> (32 - 4)" and recognize it as a rotate instead of doing separate literal shifts. but you'd need to arrange your code in a way that the compiler can have its 'aha' moment

[22:43:27] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Are the environment variables the same between running locally and development?
[22:43:30] <irwiss> apowers98: you got debug environment overriding?

[22:45:39] <apowers98> bpmedley_ I do not have any environment variables set

[22:46:30] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : How are you running the code, both with and without the debugger?
[22:46:37] <irwiss> apowers98: doesn't have to be specifically env vars, asp core for example looks for appsettings.Development.json to apply to IConfiguration
[22:47:08] <irwiss> if you grab connection string from there it'll magically appear when env is debug

[22:49:13] <apowers98> bpmedley_ irwiss I have tried running it both with and without debugger, same problem. The connection string is hard coded, which is partially working because the username field works, but the server field is pulling the hostname from my public IP

[22:49:43] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Are your running via command-line or visual studio?  Which OS are you using?
[22:49:57] <apowers98> bpmedley_ Visual Studio, Windows 10
[22:50:24] <bpmedley_> Visual Studio 2019 / 2022 / code?
[22:51:45] <apowers98> 2022 Enterprise
[22:52:18] <bpmedley_> In addition to the already mentioned appsettings, do you have a launchProperties or whatnot file?
[22:52:29] <lz_> what's a whatnot file
[22:52:33] <apowers98> bpmedley_
[22:52:39] <apowers98> I have lunchSettings
[22:52:51] <apowers98> *launchSettings, but the only thing in there is the path to the exe
[22:52:51] <bpmedley_> lz_ : I can't remember the exact name.. sounds like it's launchSettings.
[22:52:57] <lz_> apowers98: enjoy ur meal
[22:53:12] <apowers98> @lz
[22:53:19] <apowers98> lz_ Wasn't very tasty
[22:53:40] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Is this a web app or console app?
[22:54:30] <apowers98> bpmedley_ Console, specifically .net Core 3.1
[22:54:56] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Would you consider running via a cmd window?

[22:56:27] <apowers98> bpmedley_ I have tried, same error. Specifically the error is "15:25:13.933 | Error | ReportSys | Init: MySqlConnector.MySqlException (0x80004005): Access denied for user 'user'@'cpe-24-***-***-***.cinci.res.rr.com' (using password: YES)", but when debugging, I see that same exact error, even though I can see the connection properties and see the
[22:56:27] <apowers98> correct server set
[22:57:18] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : And, will you run "set" and validate the environment variables?
[22:58:58] <apowers98> bpmedley_ I do not set any environment variables though?
[23:00:31] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : I hear you.  So, it should be an easy test to eliminate the current set of environment variables.  Maybe one got set a few weeks or something like that??

[23:03:35] <apowers98> bpmedley_ To be honest I'm not sure what you mean by running set to validate environment variable
[23:04:23] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Run the command "set" and see if there is anything shown that might be causing MySQL to use a different server than what is specified in the connection string..
[23:05:01] <apowers98> It tells me the command is not valid
[23:05:19] <bpmedley_> Are you running cmd.exe?
[23:05:53] <apowers98> Got it finally
[23:07:52] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Do you see anything odd or MySQL related?
[23:08:11] <apowers98> bpmedley_ Nope
[23:08:22] <bpmedley_> Do you have the "mysql" command-line client installed?
[23:09:16] <apowers98> no
[23:09:59] <apowers98> bpmedley_ Yes
[23:10:35] <bpmedley_> Does the connection work when you run "mysql db_Name" ?
[23:12:16] <apowers98> It is on a remote server, so I add in --host and the username/password, and it is denied
[23:13:11] <bpmedley_> apowers98 : Does the connection string use IP or hostname?
[23:13:34] <apowers98> hostname
[23:13:47] <bpmedley_> Is the hostname a FQDN?
[23:14:58] <apowers98> Oh my...
[23:15:24] <apowers98> bpmedley_ I am so sorry for wasting so much of your time, turns out the password was not correct, even though I thought I went back and double-checked it
[23:15:31] <bpmedley_> haha
[23:16:49] <apowers98> Also turns out what I thought I was seeing as the server name, was just telling me what host I was connecting from, not what I was connecting to
[23:18:45] <bpmedley_> So, it's all fixed now, apowers98  ?
[23:18:59] <apowers98> bpmedley_ Yes, thank you!
[23:19:28] <apowers98> Now if I could just find a solution to how slow MySQL workbench is over a remote connection
