[10:23:42] <tatsumaru> hey guys, why is it that (= #"reg" #"reg") returns false?
[10:36:16] <puchka> because #"reg" is an instance of java.util.regex.Pattern?
[10:36:17] <andreyorst> tatsumaru: these are different objects, I guess they don't implement equality 
[10:38:31] <andreyorst> IIRC #"" is compiled at read time to a compiled regex pattern, so each time it is read it is compiled to a different object
[10:39:31] <tatsumaru> so each regex pattern has an unique identifier or something which fails equality?

[10:41:36] <puchka> https://stackoverflow.com/a/10055112/2147880
[10:41:58] <puchka> I don't know what happened
[10:42:45] <andreyorst> tatsumaru: they simply do not provide an equality method to use. For some reason
[10:43:07] <tatsumaru> puchka is that what they recommend in this post: (= (re-find #"reg" "reg") (re-find #"reg" "reg"))
[10:43:11] <andreyorst> [1] and [1] are also a different objects, but they're comparable
[10:44:11] <andreyorst> tatsumaru: (= (.pattern #"foo") (.pattern #"foo")) should do the trick
[10:45:01] <Solid> that's not a true equality for regexes though is it?
[10:45:07] <Solid> (which would be quite expensive, anyways)
[10:46:02] <andreyorst> I'm not sure if it is possible to compare compiled patterns, so extracting the original pattern is the only way I can think of
[10:46:23] <Solid> I never understood why Java thought it was a good idea to implement a bogus pointer equality on Object such that everything will have to suffer under it
[10:46:44] <Solid> just let things be noncomparible!
[10:50:56] <andreyorst> throwing exceptions on compare might be even worse idea tbh
[10:51:29] <Solid> I'm not talking about exception, I'm talking about compile-time errors
[10:51:33] <andreyorst> Rust at least throws a compile time error when you try to compare something that doesn't implement a comparison trait
[10:52:20] <andreyorst> Solid: but how do you know it? I mean with all this reflection, DI, e.t.c.
[10:52:26] <puchka> tatsumaru: I think, it advise to the pattern method on each Pattern object then compare the result.
[10:52:35] <puchka> *call
[10:54:19] <Solid> andreyorst: oh, that exists as well, right :/  well, oop was a mistake i guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:55:35] <andreyorst> I don't think oop is to blame here. JVM is just a dynamical environment, and it's hard to do full static checking on the dynamic environment in the first place
[10:56:02] <andreyorst> maybe oop played a role in it tho
[10:56:14] <Solid> no oop -> no reflection, no?
[10:56:36] <andreyorst> reflection is the result of JVM operating types in runtime
[10:56:51] <andreyorst> oop is just a paradigm, I mean, it's an implementation detail
[10:57:14] <andreyorst> static languages don't expose types at runtime (usually)
[10:57:18] <Solid> well, that operating on types at runtime has to come from somewhere
[10:57:26] <Solid> if you know all type information at compile time you're gucci
[10:58:08] <andreyorst> hopefully GraalVM will tame reflection use a bit

[12:51:14] <wink> I'd say never
[12:51:48] <wink> because in natural language you can glance and infer the meaning. and the probability of a one-char-off will hardly reverse the meaning.
[12:52:00] <wink> whereas i++ vs i-- could do the exact opposite
[12:52:42] <wink> but I think that's a special case where you try to "quickly read" it once and not analyze every line

[14:30:40] <Para> To add to the natural language discussion a bit earlier, natural languages are also terribly messy :) Especially like my native moonlanguage Finnish, we do have a formalized version but really it's a more of a noise of conjugations where order dictates loosely the priority... :)

[14:33:12] <Para> Finnish is ranked what, second or third hardest language on the planet to learn, so...yes? :)
[14:33:51] <tatsumaru> So if natural languages are messier and we still understand them immediately, doesn't that mean that formal languages should be easier to comprehend 
[14:34:58] <Para> (apparently Finnish is now sixth, a lot of Asian languages have gotten their ranks updated)
[14:35:35] <Para> Computer languages aren't really languages, it's an issue of missing a better name for them and language sort of stuck.
[14:36:05] <Para> Also formalism is surprisingly hard concept, as it is effectively the ignorance of intuition :)
[14:36:34] <tatsumaru> I'm studying Japanese now, it's heavily context based, which I actually enjoy. There's very little meta data.
[14:36:58] <Para> Tesla will happily drive under an eighteen wheeler while a person is physically incapable of doing so because something at the back of their head is going "YOU ARE NOT KILLING YOURSELF TODAY IDIOT"
[14:37:27] <tatsumaru> Hard disagree
[14:37:58] <Para> Self-harm out of blue is really, really hard.
[14:38:09] <Para> But that's quite a tangent.
[14:39:00] <Para> Finnish and Japanese, both as culture and language, are curiously harmonic. I think it was back in eighties when our two nations kinda discovered each other and did that Spider-Man pointing meme thing. Like obviously we have nothing in common, yet we're oddly familiar and fine with each other.
[14:40:34] <tatsumaru> People don't drive under an eighteen wheeler not because of a spidey sense, but because they can identify an eighteen wheeler most of the time and they have learned that this is a no-go-zone. Same way like a Tesla "thinks" only Tesla is never angry or drunk or sleepy and has looked at millions of 18 wheelers before.
[14:41:06] <Para> And why do we recognize it as a no-go zone? :)
[14:41:12] <Para> Can't be past experience.
[14:41:21] <Para> (well, I _hope_ it's not past experience)
[14:44:13] <tatsumaru> Well I am not sure where instinct comes from, it's possibly genetic memory, which is either random (nonsensical unobservable mathematical concept) or past experience.
[14:44:49] <Para> The correct answer is that nobody knows, but there are some good quesses :) But anyway, the voice I mentioned isn't necessarily a literal voice, it is the thing that overrides your actions.
[14:45:48] <Para> And the weird thing is that it's quite easy to think that yes, I consciously made a smart decision, even though the world we observe actively is about 150 milliseconds ago.

[16:27:35] <tatsumaru> is reagent like a wrapper for react?
[16:28:10] <Para> tatsumaru: To be clear, React is just the view layer, you need to figure out even in JS land how to do the rest of the application as well :) But yes, CLJS has all the tools already, I'd recommend starting with reagent and maybe some simple URL router and storage-atom on top of that.

[16:28:37] <tatsumaru> I see, thanks. That's good news.

[18:14:35] <TimMc> Theoretically, you could have a Pattern object that knew that aa* and a*a were equivalent, and could use that as its equals() basis. :-)

[18:37:08] <TimMc> In computer science, a regular language (language = possibly infinite set of strings) is any of: The empty set, any single character, any 0+ repetition of those strings, any concatenation of those strings, any union of those languages.
[18:38:11] <tatsumaru> isn't this everything?
[18:38:13] <TimMc> and you can represent that with regular expressions, e.g. ab*|c
[18:38:44] <TimMc> Nope! For example, the set of strings aaa...baaa... where there's the same number of a on each side? Not a regular language.
[18:39:12] <TimMc> For that you need something more powerful, such as a context-free language (represented by a context free grammar.)
[18:40:04] <TimMc> Regular languages can always be implemented with a state machine, but to get languages like that a^n b a^n above, you need to add a stack. :-)
[18:40:40] <tatsumaru> what's an example of an irregular language
[18:40:53] <TimMc> Clojure. :-)

[18:43:34] <TimMc> I recommend reading up on state machines and regular languages. It's quite fun, and state machines show up more concretely in programming from time to time. It's good to have familiarity with them.
[18:49:27] <tatsumaru> when you say 'machine' what do you mean, compilers?
[18:50:12] <Para> Maybe one thing worth pointing out is that commonly used terminology can have widely different meaning depending on context, eg. function is quite different in mathematics, computer science and then this whatever it is that we actually do.
[18:50:33] <Para> (similarly when people say "mathematics" they most probably mean "arithmetics")
[18:50:45] <tatsumaru> isn't lisp based on lambda calculus?
[18:50:51] <tatsumaru> how can they be so different
[18:52:42] <Para> There's no `eval` in lambda calculus; yes, it is obviously evaluated to come into a result, but to get there a certain McCarthy's student had to implement it to get his homework done... :)
[18:54:12] <TimMc> tatsumaru: Skimming through this, it looks like a reasonable introduction to state machines: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-machines-basics-of-computer-science-d42855debc66/
[18:54:47] <TimMc> But yeah, the "regular expression" in CS and in actual programming are somewhat different beasts.
[18:55:20] <tatsumaru> thanks, I will check it out
[18:56:16] <TimMc> Watch out for the bit about HTML tags, that's a little misleading. If you want to parse HTML with a regex, you need to add a stack and run in a loop. :-) You can't do it with a single regex call.

[19:04:08] <Para> I want to say because it's the academia, but that probably is completely false statement.
[19:05:04] <Para> There are no truths in science, only theorems and proofs. Anything previously discovered can later on be proven to be false, or made more accurate. It's never "done".
[19:05:19] <tatsumaru> I've been called anal-retentive on at least one occasion on account of obsessing over tiny details
[19:05:44] <tatsumaru> people generally don't want to discuss the epistemology of paradigms
[19:05:48] <tatsumaru> i find it interesting
[19:08:32] <TimMc> I'd say the concepts are pretty precice, but the *choice of names* might not be.
[19:12:10] <aphyr> Even in academia, it's normal for two different papers--even in the same domain!--to define different meanings for a common word like "system".
[19:12:18] <logiz> Para: to say there are no truths in science sounds strange
[19:12:31] <aphyr> Prescriptivism is not gonna work outside a controlled vocabulary context.
[19:12:42] <tatsumaru> I am guessing he meant there are no absolute truths
[19:13:08] <aphyr> There are like... ten different definitions of "serializability" in the literature, and that's a *way* better defined term than "system"
[19:13:10] <tatsumaru> at the end of the day we are the ones inventing the concepts so they are only as accurate as our understanding
[19:13:58] <Para> logiz: Well, there kinda isn't, just a long series of proofs building up on previous proofs :)
[19:14:45] <tatsumaru> technically speaking the laws of physics aren't provable, just stuff that noone has managed to disprove
[19:14:56] <Para> It also gets hard in natural language to talk about these things, as common phrases include stuff like "laws of physics", like what laws, I can't just break them because I'm feeling a bit criminal.
[19:15:37] <logiz> but you can say there are true things in physics.  There exists some kind of force where the force appears to hold us to close to the earth.  That's not to say what that force is, it's to say that there's _something_ and a complete understanding is to be discovered :)
[19:16:13] <tatsumaru> Para: well you are allowed to design new words which better reflect the dynamic of what you are experiencing if you can, for example principles of physics sounds a bit closer to home than laws of physics
[19:16:32] <Para> Our universe is held together by the system formed by laws of physics, we just don't know that well if we are even close to understanding this system :)
[19:16:44] <logiz> yeah that's fair
[19:18:00] <aphyr> tatsumaru: principles and laws, at least in a US physics context, are... sorta two different things
[19:18:22] <Para> One of my small favorites is trying to come up with an answer to "What was before Big Bang?" That is, how to describe that nothingness, since time didn't exist before it. In fact time currently doesn't seem to exist even now according to our understanding of physics, and that's the kind of stuff I have no brains for.
[19:19:16] <tatsumaru> Para: you can't rely on logic to compensate for lack of knowledge, too many assumptions will just result in some trash like string theory
[19:19:22] <Para> That's a very semantically loaded thing in itself; obviously time must exist, as it is observed, measured etc. but the "what" is really hard.
[19:20:06] <Para> I'd say knowledge is logic.
[19:20:08] <aphyr> tatsumaru: "law", at least in my physics education, refers to a specific mathematical models for some kind of phenomena. Principles are more like... core models/abstractions/axioms/entities for a field.
[19:21:17] <Para> Also I'd rather not design new words, it'd be just https://xkcd.com/927/ all over again.

[19:22:49] <tatsumaru> aphyr: well my understanding of law is a man-manufactured rule that can be bent or broken
[19:23:05] <aphyr> That's... not what that term means in physics
[19:23:17] <Para> aphyr: I'm still waiting for my crap knowledge of Swedish to become relevant :) Due to political weirdness in 70s majority of Finns had to learn Swedish as mandatory language and pretty much no one understands or likes the language as its result...
[19:23:23] <tatsumaru> that's why I suggested that it's probably not a good idea to use that term in physics
[19:23:47] <aphyr> Terms have different meanings in each field. This is a normal feature of language---words are deeply contextual.
[19:24:05] <tatsumaru> Para: going flirting in Sweden could make Swedish useful
[19:24:14] <Para> Yeah, don't change terminology in pursuit of something more descriptive, just make sure everyone within the context understand the term better.
[19:24:50] <Para> This is, heh, the idea of Ubiquitous Language in DDD.
[19:24:52] <tatsumaru> aphyr: that's equal to inventing new words that sound the same. not a very sound approach IMO.

[19:27:45] <aphyr> Have you ever considered taking a course in linguistics?
[19:28:16] <tatsumaru> oddly yes, recently I've started to contemplate it
[19:28:32] <aphyr> You'll probably find it fascinating, and it'll help you understand some of why human languages are So Weird
[19:28:59] <tatsumaru> I am also curious about NLP so that could help me
[19:30:02] <Para> There's this wonderful lie in NLP that language translation could be done through vectorization. That would require the language properties to be dimensionable/translatable in uniform way as well :D
[19:30:21] <aphyr> In particular, you might want to look at sociolinguistics' notion of indexicality, and maybe Judith Butler's work on performativity and referent-reference chains.
[19:33:37] <tatsumaru> aphyr: here's a little idea I came up with that I wanted to post on /r/philosophyofscience, it's called "why I think math is invented and infinity is an error", if you feel like reading it, let me know what you think: https://paste.rs/CZL
[19:34:09] <TimMc> tatsumaru: To perhaps address your original question, I don't think "machine" has any particular meaning in CS. "State machine" does, however. :-)
[19:37:31] <TimMc> I guess you could say it's a metaphor.
[19:37:58] <aphyr> Yeah, math is definitely invented, and we know it's incomplete. I think that's been a consensus position since... at least the early 20th century--there was an attempt towards universal formalization in the 1920s and 1930s, and that effort collapsed with Godel, Turing, Church, and Tarski's proofs that many theorems in mathematics were unprovable/unsolvable/incompatible.
[19:39:50] <aphyr> "the foundation of math is infinitely inaccurate" is... a category error, I'd say. Math, as a formal system, can't be accurate or inaccurate. You're talking about correspondence truth---that the math corresponds in some way to reality. Whole different problem, outside of the scope of mathematics.

[19:49:55] <tatsumaru> aphyr: I think I heard Roger Penrose recently say that he thinks math is discovered, not sure if he's credible among the scientific community and just a sample size of 1 though.
[19:51:25] <aphyr> When I say "invented", I mean it's a.) a social process, b.) the formalism need not correspond to anything in "the real", and c.) there is no single privileged "true" math to discover: inconsistent branches of math (say, ZF vs ZFC) are both "math".

[19:53:31] <tatsumaru> aphyr: I think that's what most people mean by invented, and I think when scientists say they think math is discovered they mean that essentially the universe is a computer
[19:54:03] <TimMc> Well, it is. It's computing itself. ;-)
[19:54:15] <TimMc> at one second per second (local time)
[19:54:45] <TimMc> But there's a very different question of "does math describe the universe" (or rather, which *parts* of math).
[19:55:19] <logiz> the universe is written in clojure
[19:55:20] <Solid> aphyr: from my point of view a.) is obviously true, b.) is obviously true if you mean "in the real world" and false otherwise, and c.) is sort of missing the point in the sense that objects don't fight for "existence" just because one may choose different underlying sets of axioms

[19:56:41] <aphyr> Solid: Yeah, I think we're in agreement then. I emphasize "invented" because a lot of folks have this naive assumption that there's a fixed axiom set and  "discovery" is bound to the physical world, as opposed to "exploring the derivable space of statements from a set of axioms"
[19:57:59] <aphyr> (that's the sense I was getting from tatsumaru's post, anyway)
[19:58:49] <Solid> ah I see; I like to emphasise "discovered" a lot because it's what I _feel_ when doing maths (plus, I think it's more chic to write "we discovered XYZ" in a paper than "we invented XYZ" :])

[21:05:06] <tatsumaru> aphyr, I feel like the discovery you are talking about is more of a meta-discovery as in "I discovered a hidden chest in this game" rather than I am doing symbolic descriptions of "real" processes.
[21:05:50] <tatsumaru> this is a slipper slope though because you can adjust the context to turn everything into a discovery this way
