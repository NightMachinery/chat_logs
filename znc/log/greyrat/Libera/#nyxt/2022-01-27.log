[00:21:28] <mariari> qhong: btw started to play with modf it works decently well, seems to have issues with literals however due to the rewrite nature of it
[00:22:50] <mariari> I think there might be a better way to derive such functions, I kind of wish CL gave out the struct and the specification for the struct as another output that you can start deriving functionality for

[12:05:55] <occ> I'm trying installing nyxt from quicklisp.
[12:07:56] <occ> don't know how to resolv this problem.   the same problem as https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/230
[12:10:58] <aartaka> occ: you need to make sure cffi knows where to look for lfp. Try doing `(push #p"/path/to/libfixposix/dir/" cffi:*foreigh-library-directories*)`
[12:12:29] <aartaka> lagash: gopher://baud.baby/ should work now (even though escape seqs look scary)! The fun thing is, my ISP was blocking gopher requests all along 0_o

[12:28:43] <occ> and the error remains.
[12:35:36] <occ> tried libfixposix installed in /usr/local/lib/libfixposix.so
[12:38:13] <occ>  reinstall cffi solve this problem.

[20:42:41] <mariari> hmm I've updated nyxt and it's gotten a bit unstable on me
[20:43:11] <mariari> it just freezes
[20:43:16] <mariari> so I can't stack trace or anything :(
[20:47:47] <mariari> seems it lost my cookies again
[22:47:36] <lagash> it barfed bananas?! :P
[23:34:20] <lagash> aartaka: I had a feeling it was a firewall or other networking issue for you..
[23:38:22] <aartaka> lagash: Yes, my university ISP is unreasonably restrictive about any anomaly (that is anything except Google Chrome YouTube traffic :D)
[23:42:26] <lagash> Still can't access gopher://baud.baby, same bug, although it doesn't crash this time, oddly, just freezes
[23:42:41] <lagash> *no config, too
[23:53:10] <aartaka> lagash: Do you add a slash in the end?
[23:54:08] * aartaka thinks it was a bad idea to stick to tge spec so strictly...

[23:55:11] <lagash> aartaka: huh, whatdoyaknow..
[23:55:24] <lagash> still, it shouldn't freeze or crash if you leave it out..
[23:55:41] <lagash> guess there needs to be an ANSI escape codes mode }:)
[23:57:58] <aartaka> lagash: Yes, that's fair. I'm almost done with internal scheme error handling, should be done tomorrow, so most freezes/crashes will be gone and the rest — debuggable.
