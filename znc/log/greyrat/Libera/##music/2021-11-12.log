[23:28:30] <louipc> too much stuff
[23:42:57] <artao> pfft. hardly
[23:43:08] <artao> a bunch of gardening stuff was sitting on the table basically
[23:43:19] <artao> which i already intended to straighten up before winter
[23:46:02] <golrom> corn

[23:46:56] <artao> does anyone see any issues?
[23:47:09] <artao> they have in the past given me shit about my bike trailer. they can FUCK RIGHT OFF on that one
[23:47:19] <artao> want me to have a nicer looking bike trailer? fucking buy me one
[23:47:32] <artao> OH NOES! Does it look like I'm in poverty?
[23:47:36] <artao> IT'S CUZ I FUCKING WELL AM
[23:47:47] <artao> they even gave me shit one year cuz they wanted me to get a new table
[23:47:48] <artao> i shit you now
[23:47:52] <artao> the didn't like my table
[23:48:06] <golrom> this battle axe rings when you sharpen it
[23:48:07] <artao> i explained to them how that table has been in my family for like 40 yrs
[23:48:27] <artao> i bought a cheap-ass tablecloth to put over it
[23:48:34] <artao> thunderstorms took that
[23:48:43] <artao> and i am NOT going to just keep buying new table cloths
[23:48:47] <artao> anyhow
[23:48:50] <artao> <sigh>
[23:49:04] <louipc> screw it down or something
[23:49:13] <artao> it might be time to start considering legal action against them for this sort of harrassment, which has gone on just about the whole time i've lived here
[23:49:22] <louipc> i agree
[23:49:29] <louipc> or just move
[23:49:31] <louipc> fukem
[23:49:33] <artao> fuck that shit
[23:49:41] <louipc> i guess the legal action can make them pay for you moving
[23:49:46] <artao> im into my 11th year here. longest i've ever lived anywhere in my adult life
[23:49:48] <golrom> bet a nice giant turd would keep the tableclothg on the table in a good breeze
[23:49:50] <louipc> to a nicer place
[23:49:53] <artao> this eviction threat tho
[23:49:57] <artao> grrrrr >:(
[23:50:07] <golrom> ive never lived anywhere longer than 4 years
[23:50:14] <artao> THAT causes undue stress and anxiety. which is a problem for me already, considering I'm bi-polar
[23:50:17] <artao> which they know
[23:50:19] <golrom> fight it
[23:50:24] <louipc> why would you stay at the shit place
[23:50:28] <golrom> sue them for harrasment
[23:50:42] <artao> cuz it's govt. subsidized rent
[23:50:50] <louipc> ohLOL
[23:50:52] <golrom> poop on their windshield
[23:51:03] <artao> currently $138/mo ..... went up 10 bucks this year. the largest rent increase in the entire 11 yrs i've lived here
[23:51:14] <louipc> fuk tahts cheep
[23:51:14] <golrom> go to their place of business and leave birdseed all over the place for the pidgeons
[23:51:20] <artao> also, aside from this annual harassment, i like the place
[23:51:36] <louipc> u get wat u pay for
[23:51:44] <louipc> try to sue i guess good luck
[23:51:54] <louipc> better find a good ass lawyer
[23:52:08] <louipc> trying to sue govt aint easy street
[23:53:20] <louipc> play the political cards
[23:53:32] <louipc> find out the power structure of whos sending you the letters
[23:53:36] <louipc> find out who hates them
[23:53:41] <artao> sue?
[23:53:42] <artao> no
[23:53:51] <artao> i'd just bring HUD down on their heads
[23:53:54] <artao> ....... again ........
[23:53:57] <artao> HUD/FDA
[23:54:02] <louipc> yes if the HUD hates them
[23:54:04] <louipc> works
[23:54:17] <artao> i got someone fired once by going to HUD
[23:54:22] <louipc> but make sure it wont backfire on you
[23:54:23] <artao> they tried to pull some illegal shit
[23:54:30] <artao> oh, i know how to go about such
[23:54:39] <artao> what a fucking thing to wake up to tho eh?
[23:54:46] <artao> egregious 5 day eviction notice
[23:54:47] <louipc> because HUD will fuck with you for 'clutter' just as well
[23:54:51] <artao> nope
[23:55:03] <artao> "clutter" is not a defined term. it is flexible and subjective
[23:55:10] <artao> i've already looked into this
[23:55:24] <louipc> i mean they'll find the term if they they really want to
[23:55:32] <louipc> if they dont like you
[23:55:32] <artao> HUD told me they can't evict me for "clutter" (when they were harassing me about inside my apartment)
[23:55:59] <artao> if they "don't like me" and keep this shit up .... yeah
[23:56:01] <artao> bad for them
[23:56:02] <artao> lol
[23:56:14] <artao> then I rain down the ADA on them
[23:56:14] <louipc> good luck
[23:56:30] <artao> harassment due to a disability
[23:56:39] <louipc> better to get your own land ;)
[23:56:47] <artao> if i'm too depressed to shower for 1/2 yr, how the fuck am i gonna keep up with "clutter" eh?
[23:56:50] <louipc> with no one within a mile
[23:56:54] <artao> i wish!!
[23:57:08] <artao> it will forever be a dream, unless one of my songs or art suddenly hits it big
[23:57:12] <artao> which is highly unlikely
[23:57:36] <artao> OH! get this too
[23:57:44] <artao> my newest neighbor has cats
[23:57:51] <artao> they made her give up her 3rd cat to move in
[23:58:05] <artao> DESPITE that being illegal regarding emotional support animals
[23:58:05] <louipc> 3 cats too many
[23:58:21] <artao> AND they made her pay a pet deposit ... AGAIN illegal when it comes to emotional support animals
[23:58:29] <artao> but they keep doing it
[23:58:32] <louipc> illegal doesnt matter
[23:58:43] <artao> they backed off when i threw that at em
[23:58:49] <louipc> they can ask
[23:58:54] <artao> helped someone else not have to pay that stupid $300 pet deposit
[23:59:10] <artao> i <3 the ADA
[23:59:12] <louipc> its up to her to deny
