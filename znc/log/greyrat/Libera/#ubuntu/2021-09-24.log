[03:10:20] <EriC^^> ghostnik1: in the future use sudo reboot to reboot or sudo poweroff if the gui button isnt working or so
[03:10:51] <EriC^^> so the fs doesnt get corrupted and stuff, that would suck

[04:02:53] <ghostnik11> t3stubbuntu, yeah but it was very clever what eric^^ suggested. he basically made the system think we had the uefi boot folder in another location so now the windows mbr just goes straight to grub when i turn on the 2 in 1 tablet

[06:03:23] <leftyfb> maybe the bad memory could have corrupted the entire filesystem at the block level, that I'm not too familiar with. Either way, nothing to do now except reinstall. Possibly assuming a bad drive and replacing the drive

[10:05:31] <TomTom> Good morning. Anybody has an idea to to check which DNS is really being used when resolving a hostname? systemd-resolve uses the internal dns server (dnsmasq or whatever) to resolv a host. But so you can't see which of the real configured DNS servers is being queried. (e.g. SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53))

[10:26:08] <TomTom> rfm: I have multiple entries with DNS scope. I've checked the order in the generated  /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf and there the VPN one is the first, but still it seem to resolve the names via the DNS from the internet connection. It might be related with the search domains? Whats odd to me is that the link shows "DNS Domain: ~." I never saw this syntax before. Is that valid?

[13:37:51] <oldgalileo> lotuspsychje: Yeah, exactly. I looked at the systemd kernel compatibility table and I guess beyond losing some features I'm curious why it's locked on 237.
[13:38:23] <lotuspsychje> oldgalileo: because ubuntu keeps package versions for your ubuntu release
[13:38:51] <lotuspsychje> oldgalileo: you can try !backports or !pinning as alternative

[21:05:35] <ravage> also ubuntu loses control about disabling features. mozilla always had strange ideas about integration of ads and so on in the past
[21:05:53] <ravage> if they decide to include that in their snap there is no fallback to patch it out

[21:07:48] * ogra wonders if we should move to #ubuntu-discuss 🙂 (i'm actually suprised noboday shouted "off topic" yet 🙂 )
[21:08:49] <alkisg> Eh. Support sometimes also involves technical discussions, not just helping users deal with their pc problems
[21:09:03] <ogra> heh
[21:09:07] <alkisg> But sure if someone shouts, we could move it
[21:09:51] <ogra> alkisg, snaps are built (and run on top of) against their base ... you cant just unsquashfs them, add a wrapper and expect them to work
[21:10:47] <alkisg> If you unsquashfs them at the same location where they're mounted, the "patch" to make them run would be big?
[21:10:56] *** Quits: dehhy^ (~dehhy@12.203.127.82) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:11:08] <alkisg> E.g. if I make a "snap-to-deb" converter, which puts them in that exact place, they wouldn't run?
[21:11:13] <ogra> there are also layouts that bind moun certain dirs in the environment to other places etc ... your wrapping mechanism would have to take all this into account ... and that can differ massively from snap to snap
[21:12:12] <ogra> well, you still would need to exec them on top of their base (the "core, core18 or core20" snap) ...
[21:12:17] <leftyfb> goddard: snaps as a package solution do not add network interfaces. What exactly are you referring to?

[21:12:58] <alkisg> Hmm ogra that would be a very interesting discussion, but I lack the familiarity with snap to make useful proposals :/
[21:13:10] <leftyfb> ogra: only if you install the docker or lxd. And those add network interfaces the same way the .deb or .rpm or .tar.gz do

[21:14:10] <ogra> alkisg, it would be really hard to do ... you'd have t create a chroot on top of the base snap, do all the layout bind mounting ... then there might be patches *in* the SW to actually add correct prefixes to paths for use with interfaces ... which would break without confinement
[21:14:25] <alkisg> Ouch :/
