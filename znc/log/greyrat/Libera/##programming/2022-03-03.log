[00:14:10] <ProfSimm> The point of WASM is to provide a nice compilation target for existing high-level languages, like C++ and what not.

[00:47:39] <pyzozord> Look there is no way it make the complex thing as fast as the simple thing
[00:48:06] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: first, that video is way too old.
[00:48:20] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: second, tracing JIT is precisely taking a complex thing and making it simple
[00:48:24] <pyzozord> And i agree 80% of yhe problem is in the code design programmers produce
[00:48:26] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: that's the whole point
[00:48:41] <pyzozord> However I say that js encourages that bad design
[00:48:50] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: how
[00:49:09] <pyzozord> With it's prototypal data model

[00:50:13] <CalimeroTeknik> these efforts still count!
[00:50:27] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: look, stop yourself and tell me again with a straight face YouTube is slow because you have no SIMD and I'll quit programming
[00:50:41] <CalimeroTeknik> the sacrifice of skilled engineer effort that could have been spent to create better languages ends up used to deal with tech debt
[00:51:57] <pyzozord> ProfSimm huh?
[00:52:08] <ProfSimm> CalimeroTeknik: I don't have to take into account "coming up with the JIT" because it's there. You don't write the JIT when you write JS. It's written
[00:52:20] <pyzozord> I gave you a number of concrete reasons as well as high level conceptual reasons

[00:54:20] <CalimeroTeknik> ProfSimm, I notice you're not addressing my "minefield" argument; do you dismiss it on the basis of transpiling from a sane language to use on the programmer side?
[00:54:49] <pyzozord> ProfSimm it is fundamentally relevant. It's full of pointers
[00:54:51] <ProfSimm> CalimeroTeknik: "minefield" is not a performance argument. It's an argument about bugs. No one is talking about bugs here. 
[00:55:03] <pyzozord> Pointers screw up cpu cache

[01:20:00] <CalimeroTeknik> before typescript, people had to go out of their way not to release the source code; now it's the opposite
[01:20:34] <CalimeroTeknik> (with typescript you have to go out of your way to make the source code accessible to the end user)

[01:21:40] <CalimeroTeknik> you are under the confusion that I'm not arguing technically what is possible, but what ends up being done out of laziness
[01:21:57] <CalimeroTeknik> it has always been possible to uglify code somewhat
[01:22:04] <CalimeroTeknik> but it was extra effort and not everyone bothered

[01:23:17] <CalimeroTeknik> there's also the fact that strings as keys in JS-objects couldn't be uglified under many conditions, and so uglification had a limited ability to actually make the code unreadable
[01:24:31] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a serious fallacy to cling onto absolute possibilities, as in "is this (still) doable or not", because the real world works in terms of what is easiest

[02:35:33] <ProfSimm> quazimodo: but now I have the LISP issue
[02:35:37] <quazimodo> oh lord
[02:35:44] <quazimodo> which LISP issue
[02:35:47] <ProfSimm> quazimodo: where it looks so cohesive, it's all blurring together
[02:35:52] <ProfSimm> With lots of ()
[02:36:07] <ProfSimm> I need to add back some variety
[02:36:13] <ProfSimm> so it looks like normal code
[02:36:18] <quazimodo> i wanna see some source
[02:36:24] <quazimodo> you've got me intrigued
[02:36:29] <quazimodo> the LISP issue is that the code is the AST
[02:36:35] <quazimodo> is your code your AST
[02:37:05] <ProfSimm> I'd need to explain the semantics, doesn't make sense without it. Anyway. I'll give an example.
[02:37:59] <ProfSimm> foo & bar & baz <--- this the same as foo; bar; baz;  because the & operator acts like 'and then', like a monad. It's useful for both logical expressions, and for ordering statements to run.
[02:38:35] <quazimodo> but it doesn't compose the functions does it?
[02:38:45] <ProfSimm> It can.
[02:39:00] <quazimodo> so if `bar` has arity 1 it'll pass the output of foo into bar?
[02:39:56] <ProfSimm> quazimodo: you need to explicitly accept it say "bar" outputs two numbers, you can bind them via   bar & a, b -> baz
[02:40:10] <ProfSimm> Syntax work in progress. It's not a closure, it's a continuation
[02:40:39] <quazimodo> can the symbol `baz` be a continuation?
[02:40:54] <quazimodo> or does it have to be explicit in the syntax after &
[02:41:38] <ProfSimm> you can name the continuations like keys in a record (or goto labels if you will), or you need to place them after & and | logical operators.
[02:41:51] <ProfSimm> So "a, b -> baz" is the continuation in this case

[05:09:11] <[itchyjunk]> ~$100k isn't bad at all though

[05:19:26] <[itchyjunk]> But they want to "rent" parts of it out.
[05:19:33] <flakland> that's what nasa is good at, moving dates
[05:19:40] <[itchyjunk]> oldlaptop, they have alrady started taking biddings for renting.
[05:19:51] <[itchyjunk]> Which they want to move to privatization in near future
[05:20:12] <[itchyjunk]> its too expensive to maintain that thing.

[05:22:01] <[itchyjunk]> its' pretty archaic. too expensive to modernize.

[05:23:02] <[itchyjunk]> gov can't make money off it. private companies can off load the costs to rich space tourists
[05:23:35] <[itchyjunk]> ever pooped into a vacuum cleaner, sonny ?
[05:23:43] <[itchyjunk]> thats what they do in ISS
[05:24:22] <oldlaptop> I'm saying it strikes me as likely that there will already exist private facilities sufficiently superior to make it unattractive, by the time anything goes beyond "expressing interest" and target dates stop moving
[05:24:37] <[itchyjunk]> How so?
[05:24:55] <[itchyjunk]> Minus spacex, no one has capacity to build a space station bar some countries like china.
[05:25:18] <[itchyjunk]> if starship does pan out, first few years will be packed with contract and nothing will be too cheap
[05:25:35] <[itchyjunk]> so there isn't any good option to build a modern space station orbiting earth in near future.

[05:28:58] <[itchyjunk]> "NASA officials announced last week that the agency will begin renting out the International Space Station (ISS) for commercial activities for the first time. The policy opens the door to for-profit tourism, advertising, and manufacturing aboard the orbiting science lab."

[05:32:59] <oldlaptop> (Ah, I didn't see you chased the pointers too.)
[05:34:13] <[itchyjunk]> Issue is that partnered countries don't wanna bare the cost of maintanence
[05:34:33] <[itchyjunk]> if commercilization of ISS fails by 2030, they might just deorbit it
[05:34:52] <[itchyjunk]> so thats a plan b because people have emotional ties to it
[05:35:00] <[itchyjunk]> they want to save it for historic reason
[05:35:28] <[itchyjunk]> so keeping it afloat by getting into some private partnership sounded like a good idea within NASA ranks
[05:35:30] <[itchyjunk]> but who knows
[05:35:38] <[itchyjunk]> maybe we'll see it deorbited
[05:35:44] <[itchyjunk]> that thing is old tech
[05:35:49] <oldlaptop> I'm saying my knee jerks and says it's getting deorbited.
[05:36:11] <[itchyjunk]> well, not before trying private contracts
[05:36:27] <[itchyjunk]> the have green light from congress already iirc, so that's happening one way or another
[05:36:36] <[itchyjunk]> it deorbits if it fails, i suppose
[05:36:39] <oldlaptop> (Certainly before it's "privatized" in the sense of actually being sold to somebody, if that can even happen, and probably before it's "rented" into a space yacht too.)

[05:41:09] <[itchyjunk]> the barrel works anyways, just the firing mechanism is removed generally

[10:51:44] <dan01[m]> hey guys
[10:52:23] <dan01[m]> In OOP when do you pass a reference to a class in it's constructor and store it for later use, as opposed to just passing it to a method of the class without storing a reference to it?
[10:52:54] *** Quits: sheepduck_ (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[10:53:08] <dan01[m]> I'm making some good progress on my IRC client program, but I'm facing these OOP design questions that I have no idea
[10:53:09] <flakland> sounds like something you should avoid
[10:53:16] <flakland> (storing references)
[10:54:39] <mrig> dan01[m]: are you referring to a proxy object?
[10:54:45] <audio> what's a cool visualization for objects that that only range in value from 0 to 1?

[10:58:08] <undefined_bob> yesterday I got help with my VB script and I just wanted to say thank you for that help :)
[10:58:16] <mrig> dan01[m]: you could make it an actual object that contains a reference if you want, you would not be passing a pointer around then, just code it to go instantiate the object only if it is used.
[10:58:19] <dan01[m]> So look I got this class named IRCServer, it connects to the host and port of libera or whatever, but then I don't want that class, which also sends data, aka raw bits, so receives as input a string, which is a command like JOIN, NICK, etc. and it sends raw bytes to the sever
[10:58:44] <dan01[m]> I don't want that class to also store plain text commands, I feel that's another level of abstraction
[10:58:50] <dan01[m]> So I made another class that does that
[10:59:11] <dan01[m]> Now I don't know if I should keep a reference to the IRCServer class, or just pass it on a mehtod of that class

[15:56:56] <GeDaMo> Ideally, using mmap would mean the OS can make that decision at run-time
[15:57:09] <bjs> well speed vs space is a classic trade-off,  even in well-engineered systems
[15:57:53] <bjs> i guess the point is more that 'most' (by some metric) programmers aren't doing rigorous engineering really at all
[15:58:17] <pyzozord> yeah but before we get to that problem, there are mountains of incompetence and indifferene to conquer
[15:58:43] <bjs> well it also depends how much the programmer -should- care
[15:58:47] <pyzozord> yes I suppose we said the same thing differently
[15:59:27] <bjs> it's okay if 'most' apps we use day-to-day on our phones or pcs or tablets or whatever are not very good, slow and/or sluggish and/or just crashes every now and again for no good reason

[16:05:49] <bjs> pyzozord: i feel the same about software, it's okay if the table is a little heavier than it needs to be, a little less well put together, has some sharp corners and maybe doesn't handle as much weight as it could if designed better or made of better materials but so long as it isn't outright unfit for purpose it's probably fine

[16:39:43] <DPA> I used sqlite it for my music & video DB. Contains my movies, YT playlists, and other stuff. Thousends of things by now. I made a separate table for properties describing the videos, so I can add arbitrary ones. Huge mistake. I use it as kind of a tag system, which is nice. But my video portal now takes like 10 seconds or so for all the queries on certain larger overviews...

[17:41:23] <oldlaptop> Playing around with EXPLAIN QUERY PLANning the query (maybe capture a sample from your application to test?) in the sqlite3 shell is a good idea, but I'd bet you want an index on something like video_property(video, value) - the PRIMARY KEY could work fine for this, if you moved "property" last, but I don't know if you have other queries that would then benefit from an index on property.

[18:27:00] <oldlaptop> If you think that would look too messy or something, it'd be perfectly reasonable to ask the contributor to rebase first.
[18:27:16] <ProfSimm> beaky: maybe if we encode null to kill some branches we can scale this to arbitrary binary trees
[18:27:17] <no_gravi1y> oldlaptop: Yeah, I just asked them to rebase. Lets see what happens.
[18:27:22] <Decker> but the changes that happened outside also happened on that branch - so the summary of all the changes in the 10 commits of the PR includes removing that line - which I agree is annoing and odn't see any way to do it on git - there's walkthroughs for using the command line

[20:36:08] <Rounin> BASHitup: What does "delete the identified expected output" mean, anyway? Do you want to not list the duplicate files?
[20:36:14] <bjs> pyzozord: mathematics had long had an idea of functions, like f(x) = 1 + x etc, and distilling this down to its most basic components gets you something that looks like lambda calculus
[20:36:21] <BASHitup> OK, size doesn't make it a duplicative when the files are named differently. But that's a semantic argument 
[20:36:49] <BASHitup> if we have Copy vs Copy (1) ... technically the metadata is different so they're not duplicative. But they'll be the same size in some cases 
[20:37:03] <BASHitup> ... At least by recursion 
[20:37:20] <BASHitup> If it's a directory and the contents are the same, the recursive files will match up but the total size will be different. 
[20:37:22] <GeDaMo> If you want to detect duplicate files, you might want to hash the file data and compare those

[23:40:53] <pyzozord> yes, it's a very interesting idea in lambda calculus
[23:41:02] <nomagno> ... Numbers are nothing anyways, if you think about it
[23:41:04] <flakland> what is practical application of a lambda calculus
[23:41:06] <ProfSimm> Booleans are trickier in that it's not about calling or not calling. It's always calling one of two options.
[23:41:12] <pyzozord> I'm looking at this table now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Table_of_functions_on_Church_numerals

[23:41:23] *** Joins: duuude (~user@user/duuude)
[23:41:29] <ProfSimm> Booleans are more about branching
[23:41:50] <merijn> pyzozord: the classic Church encoding of true and false are "\x.\y.y" and "\x.\y.x", but to understand "why" you have to realise that "true" and "false" are just symbols and the real "meaning" of booleans is what you can do with them. So to "implement" booleans in lambda calculus we need to come up not just with a representation of true and false using only lambdas. But also the operations you wanna 
[23:41:56] <merijn> do with booleans (and how to *implement* those in lambda calculus)
[23:42:31] <pyzozord> I get Œªx.y.y and Œªx.y.x
[23:42:39] <pyzozord> I don't remember which one is tru and which one is false
[23:42:45] <nomagno> flakland: the practical application is half-discernable once you drop the extreme formalisms we're talking about here
[23:42:47] <merijn> flakland: Lambda calculus is about as minimal (in terms of definitions and rules) as you can get. While still being able to describe arbitrary computation. This is convenient if you are a computer scientist wanting to do math about computation, because the less there is, the less you have to prove things about
[23:43:02] <nomagno> Its just a way of noting programs without resorting to the messy world of programming languages
[23:43:04] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: by convention calling first is true, second is false
[23:43:17] *** Joins: Shiva (~LordShiva@user/one39dev)
[23:43:21] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: doesn't matter as long as it's consistent
[23:43:23] <flakland> application: ultimate minimalist flex?
[23:43:24] <nomagno> Its a programming language for pen and paper, essentially
[23:43:30] *** Joins: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[23:43:35] <merijn> flakland: If you want to prove things about programming languages, you don't want a billion special cases like C++, because you need to handle those. Lambda calculus has no specific cases
[23:43:38] <pyzozord> so the second argument is true
[23:44:00] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: the arguments are not true or false. 
[23:44:13] <nomagno> merijn: Yeah, it gets rid of implementation quirks
[23:44:18] <merijn> flakland: Well, since you can map basically anything to lambda calculus you do things in two steps: "map your complicated icky real world language to lambda calculus" and "prove the thing you want in the lambda calculus"
[23:44:30] <nomagno> You don't even need abstraction in lambda calculus, not really anyways
[23:44:38] <merijn> flakland: There was a formalisation of Java's typechecking which used that approach
[23:44:51] <ProfSimm> pyzozord:  then -> else -> then             then -> else -> else            This is true, and false
[23:44:53] <nomagno> You only need letters, lambda, and parentheses

[23:45:39] <merijn> pyzozord: Well, the very first thing you wanna be able to do with true and false is to branch (if-else), right?
[23:45:39] <bjs> flakland: at its core the lambda calculus is just a tiny functional programming language that has everything you need and nothing more. There is no real "practical" use for it,  other than perhaps as an artefact to study for people interesting in computation or type theory,  or perhaps some version of it as a compiler target

[23:47:33] <bjs> pyzozord: the idea is to throw away booleans and instead use functions.  make true and false be a function.  so `true 0 1 == 0` and `false 0 1 == 1`

[23:47:51] <pyzozord> ooh ok
[23:47:51] <merijn> pyzozord: If we use 'true = \x.\y.y' and 'false = \x.\y.x' then we can implement "if = \b.\x.\y.b y x" (since true returns it's second argument and false returns its first)

[23:48:18] <bjs> pyzozord: then you don't need if-then-else either, `if b then c else d` can just be written as `b c d` :)
[23:49:05] <ProfSimm> bjs: and b && c || d is also written as "b c d"
[23:49:14] <merijn> So you wanna do "and" which is "\b1.\b2.??" such that ?? returns true (i.e. \x.\y.y) if both b1 and b2 are true
[23:49:32] <merijn> pyzozord: And you can build an entire suite of boolean operations this way

[23:56:57] <pyzozord> yes that's what I thought was happening, and it was very confusing
[23:57:33] <merijn> So b applied to the y and x and we defined "true = \x.\y.y" (i.e. returning its second argument) and false as "\x.\y.x" (i.e. returning it's first)
