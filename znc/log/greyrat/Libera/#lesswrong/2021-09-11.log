[01:08:11] <feep> all tests passing too~
[01:08:24] <feep> I could totally push this, but I'm gonna fix it up a bit more too~
[01:10:03] <feep> well.. tomorrow~
[01:10:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Kind of a weird description ... this antibody "shows up"? Like... out of nowhere?
[01:11:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The antibody creates problems for the immune system by attacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 enzyme helps regulate the body’s response to the virus by metabolizing a peptide that activates the immune system. The attacking antibody interferes with ACE2’s work, which makes the antibody a prime suspect for the long-lasting illness." ... I also don't get how this is relevant to what happens a year
[01:11:03] <Obormot\Arcturus>  after infection
[01:11:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. suppose I had COVID, then a year has passed... why do I need to be regulating my response to the virus and why is it a problem if that regulation is not working right
[01:12:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> And how does it help to rectify that... a year (or w/e) after infection
[01:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all very odd
[01:13:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> They say this can lead to drugs that can "hopefully relieve people of the symptoms they’re having", but perhaps what they actually mean is that said drugs will be part of a treatment for the initial infection, that will *prevent* long covid?
[01:14:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This could lead to an increase in the abundance of Ang II, which causes a proinflammatory state that triggers symptoms of PASC [by this acronym they mean long covid]." ... hm, I see, I see
[01:14:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The long-lasting effects have been termed “Long Covid” but more recently, the syndrome is referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)."
[01:15:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Many of the manifestations of acute COVID-19 are caused by overactivation of the immune system rather than direct effects of the virus on host tissue [2]. One proposed mechanism for activation of the immune system acutely is by induction of the renin angiotensin system." ... huh, I hadn't heard this

[01:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> These are some very complicated interactions they're describing and it's way beyond my ability to understand...
[01:17:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it seems like the takeaway is that long covid is basically an autoimmune disorder?
[01:17:22] <kuudes> yes, I think so
[01:17:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well... that's unfortunate, because those are notoriously hard to treat
[01:17:45] <kuudes> which is not surprising, often things that are related to long post-infection symptoms are autoimmune things

Have we learned anything about zoonotic diseases in relation to rats, or rats in relation to zoonotic diseases? Michael Parsons: So, we’ve published one paper, one paper is in review, and one paper is in preprint. And another one is in progress. So, we’ve really covered the COVID rats’ angle, and other
[01:41:39] <feepbot> rodents. And, basically, what we observed was when restaurants closed, there was a major source of rat food that was taken off the menu for rats. Because of that, rats were sighted more often in public. Probably as they’re migrating from one location to another. Whereas rats, typically, wouldn’t move more than 50 meters [160 feet] from their food source. There are a lot of
[01:41:39] <feepbot> people thinking there are many more rats during COVID-19. It’s actually more cognitive dissonance, because there are actually 30% fewer rat calls in the early stages of the pandemic, as compared to before the pandemic. But with the fewer calls, they were more likely to be concentrated nearby closed restaurants. How do you make sense of that? Well, because the restaurants are
[01:41:44] <feepbot> closed, the rats are on the move to new locations. And so, people are more likely observing the rats as they’re moving to nearby food sources.

[02:19:55] <RiversHaveWings> But not as much as EAI these days.
[02:20:02] <shawwwn> gwern has a ton of weird ideas that don't correspond to reality
[02:20:19] <shawwwn> at the time, there were around 5 people doing anything at all in tensorfork
[02:20:27] <RiversHaveWings> A ton of stuff is discussed on EAI these days, not just LMs
[02:21:13] <shawwwn> I mean, that was the entirely obvious outcome from the moment EAI split off
[02:21:33] <shawwwn> they took all the momentum, all the people doing things, everything.
[02:21:57] <shawwwn> I don't mind, to be clear. But that's also what happened
[02:22:13] <gwern> shawwwn: we had you, aydao, ket, arfa, that chinese dude who used months of time and never said anything, skylion, a couple others. connor went to EAI, but he'd never actually done anything; bmk went with him, and was very active there but iirc didn't do much or anything with us. who did we lose that was actually working on anime stuff?
[02:22:33] <shawwwn> sid, lucidrains

[02:22:43] <gwern> ok, so that's 2
[02:23:10] <gwern> (RiversHaveWings moved over after a very long time for CLIP, but never worked on our stuff, so like bmk & connor)
[02:23:32] <shawwwn> what exactly is your point here? sid and lucidrains were the only two who ever coded anything
[02:23:41] <shawwwn> aydao had his own projects, which I respect
[02:23:57] <gwern> aydao did TADNE
[02:23:58] <shawwwn> ket and arfa had their own projects too.
[02:24:09] <shawwwn> TADNE isn't tensorfork, gwern. it never was
[02:24:14] <shawwwn> it's aydao's
[02:24:36] <gwern> tensorfork, like soylent green, is made of people
[02:24:45] <shawwwn> yes. people like sid and lucidrains
[02:24:49] <shawwwn> who left with connor

Using an Unertl telescopic sight and a mounting bracket of his own design, Hathcock

[05:31:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't even like Pokemon but

[07:22:56] <rmmh> shawwwn: idk who else would care about this but zstd dictionary compression is incredible-- train on some samples of your dataset and get >2x more effective ccompression http://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data
[07:22:57] <Robomot> Zstandard - Real-time data compression algorithm
[07:26:32] <gwern> impressive. I suppose that'd support random access much more effectively if you don't have to pay such a price for separately compressed records/files
[07:28:40] <rmmh> it's really specialized for small data-- right now I'm using it do compress ~30KB HTML files to 2KB
[07:29:44] <gwern> yeah, I was thinking of The Pile, where they zstd'd, IIRC, chunks of individual text files for easier random access to do i.i.d SGD on, and so the compression ratio was awful
[07:31:06] <rmmh> zstd also supports random access indexing :)
[07:33:55] <gwern> (but at what cost compared to streaming...)
[07:35:13] <rmmh> trying to find it again. it's effectively like resetting the context every N bytes (configurable)
[07:35:58] <gwern> yeah, figured
[07:36:22] <gwern> at least it's parallelizable
[07:37:12] <rmmh> but generally a few MB of context is close to a few hundred MB

[19:37:02] <feep> two2thehead: thank you!
[19:37:08] <feep> that makes a total of 65km this week~
[19:37:12] <kuudes> did I mention that you can now get a third shot or shot for your kid with a prescription both in usa and in eu?
[19:37:13] <catern> uggghhh
[19:37:26] <kuudes> magic words are "off label prescription"
[19:37:55] <kuudes> I am trying to find a doctor to prescribe a shot for myself
[19:38:19] <kuudes> sadly, the minimum vaccine package size is for astrazeneca vaxzevria 10x10 doses, price 0 e
[19:38:21] <two2thehead> I presume this isn't just some random shot?
[19:38:29] <kuudes> covid vaccine
[19:38:54] <kuudes> you can get pfizer comirnaty in same way, but that has way worse storage conditions
[19:38:57] <two2thehead> well yes. But I hope it's one of the x-many vaccines that were okayed?
[19:39:03] <kuudes> minimum size for that is 195 doses iirc
[19:39:10] <kuudes> any of them
[19:39:22] <two2thehead> similar to how I wondered about getting all five vaccines spaced out
[19:39:24] <catern> I sometimes upset people by being too forthright in arguments, anyone know a book or something about how to properly dissemble?
[19:39:31] <two2thehead> kuudes, ah
[19:39:32] <catern> I've been trained too well to not hedge
[19:39:38] <kuudes> the point is that after the medication has been accepted for human use by fda and ema
[19:40:02] <kuudes> then it is up to a doctor to prescribe that substance to any use case
[19:40:25] <kuudes> the approved cases are indeed 2 doses for people at least 12 years olds
[19:40:36] <catern> (so really I need some way to justify it to myself, because it's an offense to me to hedge and dissemble)
[19:40:53] <kuudes> but there is nothing preventing a licenced doctor prescribing any human allowed substance for any use case, that is called off label prescription
[19:41:10] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use
[19:41:11] <Robomot> Off-label use - Wikipedia (Off-label use is the use of pharmaceutical drugs for an unapproved indication or in an unapproved age group, dosage, or route of administration.[1] Both prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs (OTCs) can be used in off-label ways, although most studies of off-label use focus on prescription drugs. …)
[19:41:27] <kuudes> "In the United States, once a drug has been approved for sale for one purpose, physicians are free to prescribe it for any other purpose that in their professional judgment is both safe and effective, and are not limited to official, FDA-approved indications."
[19:45:38] <gwern> (how pleasant that sci-hub has started working on 2021 papers again)
[19:46:21] <quanticle> Oh, sci-hub is back? Did they win their court case in India or whatever it was that caused them to stop accepting new uploads?
[19:46:41] <quanticle> Are 2020 papers filtering in as well?
[19:46:59] <gwern> the announcement has been linked several but yes, the indian injunction thing expired a very long time ago and apparently their lawyers finally said ok so they enabled like 2m papers
[19:47:21] <quanticle> Very nice.
[19:47:22] <kuudes> gwern, can I ask your prior if EY knows about off-label use or not?
[19:47:30] <gwern> off-label use of what?
[19:47:34] <kuudes> covid vaccine
[19:48:15] <kuudes> ie any MD can write you prescription for Nth dose regardless if you are over 12 or not
[19:48:16] <gwern> why would he know much about that? he's an ai researcher, not a immune specialist or epidemiologist
[19:48:24] <kuudes> ok, thanks
[19:48:35] <kuudes> he was organizing some vaccine production and distribution thing
[19:48:47] <gwern> radvac? I didn't think he was organizing that

[20:53:51] <vrs> if you don't have enough people at your level to make allies with, then you're probably better off elsewhere
[20:53:57] <rsaarelm> I just quit my day job after not seeing a meaningful progress path after close to 15 years of various programming jobs.
[20:53:58] <vrs> if you do have these people, team up with them
[20:54:12] <gwern> vrs: that assumes that that's still possible. the company may have changed too much, the mission may have changed, you may have changed... often, quitting is the best thing for you but people are scared
[20:54:13] <catern> gwern: as always your advice is very good...
[20:54:19] <rsaarelm> Gonna just write open source Rust stuff for a while instead.
[20:54:52] <gwern> 'hodl 'rights; stack patches; push and relax'
[20:55:06] <rsaarelm> Like, it's not not knowing how to progress, it's not seeing anything that looks like stuff I want to progress to in there to begin with.
[20:55:26] <catern> (I'm scared of quitting exactly *because* I have so much meaningful progress, counter to vrs's point, and also my open source projects and blogposts are all closely tied to what I'm doing at $DAYJOB...)
[20:56:14] <vrs> in my case, I alerted my employer that I was very close to quitting because the infrastructure wasn't being taken care of, and another coworker in fact did independently quit over similar issues, so the company focus changed a bit after that
[20:56:47] <vrs> catern: huh how does that work then? ever-new bullshit to deal with?
[21:01:47] <catern> vrs: well someone who joined the team after me was promoted to tech lead, and since then I've just felt like people aren't listening to me as much as I'd like. my internal diagnosis of the issue is that either I'd like there to be senior people I can follow (and there aren't any) or others will follow me as a senior person (which they aren't, at least some aren't)
[21:01:51] *** mortehu_ is now known as mortehu
[21:02:55] <vrs> is that person a reasonable person?
[21:03:07] <vrs> but yeah I relate
[21:03:21] <rsaarelm> I realized I had two scripts fighting in my head, one for supermarket cashiers going "of course you hate your jobs, all jobs are terrible" and one for PMC going "you're expected to be self-directing at the jobs you're in, the only way to really do that is to find intrinsic value and regular self-actualization in your job". Then realized that the first one implies I should quit my job if I have
[21:03:23] <rsaarelm> enough savings to sorta get by and the second one implies I should quit my job if the self-actualization isn't being found, so they're actually in agreement.
[21:03:25] <catern> and my boss keeps telling me to stop being so argumentative and combatitive, which I guess I am
[21:04:13] <catern> (but only towards the people who aren't listening to me as a senior person! which they should be, since they're just random new hires/transfers on projects I've worked on for 5 years!)
[21:04:36] <vrs> taking things to 1v1s is very effective if you don't trust yourself to be nice in public

[23:33:15] <RiversHaveWings> senile agitation.
[23:34:54] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[23:35:24] <nshepperd> The demons are so good at painting
[23:35:35] <kuudes> but are the diagnosis phony though?
[23:35:54] <kuudes> given psychosis seems to linked strongly to low iq, and aging causes low iq
[23:36:09] <kuudes> why would there not be lots of psychosis in nursery homes?
[23:41:04] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: they have a graph that shows delusions and hallucinations are not increasing
[23:41:52] <RiversHaveWings> also i think a bunch of senior delusions are actually dementia
[23:42:23] <RiversHaveWings> antipsychotics can increase the risk of death when used for dementia related stuff
[23:43:16] <kuudes> the delusions graph seems to mirror the psychosis graph
[23:43:25] <kuudes> ie delusions + psychosis sum is constant
[23:43:42] <RiversHaveWings> ...no, the thing going up is *diagnoses*
[23:44:04] <RiversHaveWings> if the symptoms of the disorder are are going down then the diagnoses should not be going up
[23:45:13] <kuudes> https://i.imgur.com/J30VLl8.png here if you sum the lines "delusions" (yellow) and "schizophrenia diagnoses" (red) you get about constant over time
[23:45:45] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:45:55] <kuudes> no, I mean the schitzophrenia and delusions are observations of the same phenomenon
[23:46:05] <kuudes> but only one can be treated
[23:46:11] <RiversHaveWings> ...
[23:46:38] <kuudes> ie people are not both in "delusions" and "schitzophrenia" mostly, they are in one of them
[23:46:52] <kuudes> delusions is not a subset of schitzophrenia
[23:46:52] <RiversHaveWings> Schizophrenia is diagnosed when you have the symptoms
[23:47:08] <RiversHaveWings> If the diagnoses are valid that is.
[23:47:53] <kuudes> I should check what the definitions of those things in the chart are
[23:48:12] <RiversHaveWings> "The individual experiences two or more of the following for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period. And at least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3): Delusions, Hallucinations, Disorganized speech (incoherence or derailment), Completely disorganized or catatonic behavior, Negative symptoms, such as diminished emotional expression"
[23:48:33] <RiversHaveWings> that's from the DSM-5, there are some other criteria like how long you have had them and that they impair you

[23:50:04] <vrs> I can see myself going catatonic in a nursing home
[23:50:53] <gwern> what else is there to do there?
[23:51:17] <gwern> you know, as terrible as the matrix might seem, for the elderly, it's utopia
[23:51:51] <vrs> actually maybe that's the premise of matrix 4 now that the actors are all old?
[23:52:42] <gwern> 'so what's our retirement plan, Morpheus? I mean, assuming any of us survives long enough to grow old' 'oh, we just plug you back into the matrix. The machines don't carry grudges, and you still generate battery power'
[23:53:01] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: that just makes me think of those "memory care" wards for people with dementia that like... simulate an old small town and have fake bus stops to stop the seniors wandering off
[23:53:11] <gwern> exactly. like I said, utopia
[23:53:23] <gwern> the peak of humanity, when they still understood how phones worked
[23:53:35] <gwern> and when you didn't *need* to use the internet for anything 
[23:54:05] <gwern> in the matrix, there are endless fields of geriatric humans, virtually shaking their canes at the bill clinton c-span hearings...

[23:57:32] <Urchin[emacs]> gwern: why is the whitespace on gwern.net in Times New Roman?
[23:58:02] <gwern> Urchin[emacs]: it saves several kilobytes per page if we can reuse system fonts instead of having to ship thousands of SSP whitespaces
