[01:06:15] <constxd> so i have 2 points in R^3, P1 and P2. i want to find the transformation that will map P1 to P1' and P2 to P2' using only translation and rotation
[01:06:28] <constxd> should be unique right
[01:07:09] <constxd> but how do i find it
[01:10:07] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[01:12:13] <[itchyjunk]> Does that require picking a basis for R^3?
[01:13:41] <Decker> hmm not really unique... the rotation is inverted if you use p1->p1' as a translation vs p2->p2'
[01:14:43] <Decker> it's just subtracting one from another to get a translation, update the other points, and the cross product of those is the axis of rotation and cos(angle) of rotation
[01:15:09] <Decker> you can then take axis/angle and make a 3x3 matrix add a row on each side and put the translation (in a 4x4 total matrix)

[01:19:11] <Decker> sybariten why only 'i guess' ?
[01:19:25] <sybariten> And i'm intereste in knowing the probability for one wovel, one consonant. Then there are six favourable cases i imagine, AB AC AD EB EC ED ...  but i know this from basically making a tree and looking at the combinations
[01:19:57] <sybariten> So what is the formula i want that can numerically give me the six here? To be used with more complex cases for instance...
[01:20:07] <Guest45> A = [2 0; 0 3]. I found the eigenvalues lambda_1 = 3 and lambda_2 = 2. I want to find the eigenvectors. To do that I write: (A - I*lambda)*v = 0. For lambda_1, I have: [-1 0; 0 0] * (v1; v2) = (0; 0). So v2 can be anything and v1 = 0. So v = (0; 1).
[01:20:08] <Guest45> But for the second eigenvector, I get the exact same thing?
[01:20:34] <sybariten> Decker: well, i'm never sure at anything in math.... i guess P(one consonant, one wovel) is 6/10
[01:20:34] <Guest45> well, I get v1 = 0 and v2 = 0...that makes no sense
[01:21:08] <Decker> sybariten ya... it's a multiplication of the groups though probability of 1 constant * probability of 1 vowel
[01:22:58] <sybariten> Decker: at the first pull, the P(constant) is 3/5 i guess... what do i do then?
[01:23:12] <sybariten> i didnt quite get the explanation sorry
[01:23:37] <Decker> aand another pull... P(vowel) is 2/5 ... p(c)*p(v)=6/10 ?
[01:23:47] <Decker> err 25
[01:24:34] <Decker> sybariten that's the 6; don't know where the 25 goes though ...
[01:24:53] <sybariten> Sorry i don't get how you get 6 (mathematically)
[01:25:02] <Decker> 2*3 ?
[01:25:08] <cherim> Do you place items back after you take them out?
[01:25:15] <sybariten> cherim: no its without replacement
[01:25:17] <Decker> ahh
[01:25:30] <sybariten> just taking two letters randomly
[01:25:55] <Guest45> oops nevermind
[01:26:17] <cherim> Then consonant + vowel has 3/5 * 2/4 = 6/20 and vowel + consonant has 2/5 * 3/4 = 6/20, together 6/10.
[01:26:22] <sybariten> will get back to ya in half an hour, sorry

[01:57:32] <sybariten> cherim: ok but i feel like that's almost a "visual" approach, it's a bit like looking at one of those event trees. If i were to pull three letters instead and was interested specifically in the probability of getting two consonants and one wovel, that reasoning grows a bit unpractical doesn't it?
[01:58:27] <sybariten> Wouldnt i then need to look at it like (favourable cases) / (all the possible cases) ...? For the latter/lower, i have this formula of combinations, C(n,k)
[01:59:14] <sybariten> but what is my way of thinking for getting the number of favourable cases (from A B C D E) where i'm holding two consonants and one wovel?
[02:00:04] <cherim> Let there be C consonants and V vowels in the pack, and you want to get c consonants and v vowels. Then there are binom{C}{c} \binom{V}{v} favorable cases of \binom{C+V}{c+v}.

[03:34:21] <Guest45> well, I know we can compute the QR factorization of a matrix A via Householder matrices. That is, repeated multiplication on the left of A: H_(n-1) H_(n-1) * ... H_2 H_1 A = Q => A = H_1 H_2 * ... * H_n-1 R = QR
[03:34:25] <int-e> Guest45: of course it could just be false in those cases
[03:35:44] <Guest45> the motivations for even using Householder matrices is that we are wanting to eliminating the elements under the diagonals... the way we do that is via those H matrices.
[03:35:44] <Guest45> So for QR preserving Hessenberg form...
[03:35:45] <Guest45> we just modify the Hs so that we don't eliminate the sub-diagonal?

[08:40:01] <average> I don’t like it
[08:40:06] <tusko> yup
[08:40:09] <tusko> not good
[08:40:18] <isekaijin> Zero drawings is a bad thing?
[08:40:28] <tusko> Geometry is the very basis of mathematics
[08:40:45] <isekaijin> Yes, but geometry is all about sheaves of rings and modules, why do you need drawings?
[08:40:58] <tusko> because my brain is not that big yet
[08:41:41] <isekaijin> “Lacking in examples” is valid criticism, though.

[08:42:53] <sonny> isekaijin yeah, no drawings sucks
[08:43:00] <average> isekaijin: what we’re in agreement with is that drawings after some point don’t depict the actual objects being talked about, but an intuition about them, more like some diagram thing. of course you can’t have accurate actual drawings for everything, but omiting them on purpose.. even when you can make those drawings.. that annoys me a lot
[08:45:02] <mycroftiv> sheaves are like transparent blankets with structured objects imprinted in them layered across an object in way that makes the underlying object easier to study
[08:45:09] <average> Also in analysis there’s a lot of terminology, and Rudin basically has you chasing for terms all around his stupid book because they all depend on eachother. What he should have done would be to put all definitions on 3 pages and then start talking about them. Or to instruct the reader “put the definitions aside, here is a sheet with them, you will need them all throughout this book so you better have them on some separate pieces of paper so you
[08:45:09] <average> can folllow along the material”

[08:52:52] <average> You give a definition, you’re suppose to give examples of things that qualify for the definition and things that do not qualify for it
[08:53:39] <isekaijin> Yes, that much I agree with. Giving no examples is not cool.

[18:46:12] <tomeaton17> int-e well the population of A can be between 0 or A+B=N
[18:46:23] <tomeaton17> s/or/and
[18:46:26] <int-e> tomeaton17: Right. So how many such values are there?
[18:46:43] <int-e> The answer is *not* N.
[18:46:44] <tomeaton17> N+1
[18:47:03] <int-e> That's it. And that's the number of states because the population of A determines that of B.
[18:47:40] <int-e> So when the text speaks about A=k, it actually talks about one of those N+1 states.
[18:48:29] <int-e> (and you can verify that the transition probabilities from A=0 to A=-1 and from A=N to A=N+1 are both zero, so you do actually stay in the [0..N] range)

[23:31:20] <mycroftiv> basic question about sheaf definitions: when we talk about the behavior of the sheaf on space X on the open covers of the open sets the sheaf is defined on, all those sets in the covers of the open sets still have to be open sets of the topology on X still, correct?

[23:39:59] <isekaijin> Not sure what exactly you mean by “behavior”. A sheaf has “sections” on the opens of the underlying space.
[23:40:15] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: im just looking at what are legal inputs to the sheaf functor
[23:40:58] <mycroftiv> isejaijin: the presheaf is defined as taking inputs of the open sets of the topology on X. the conditions for a presheaf being a sheaf refer to the behavior on open covers of those open sets
[23:41:09] <isekaijin> The source category is the opposite of the poset of opens of a topological space.

[23:41:48] <mycroftiv> i am confirming that every input to the sheaf has to be an open set of the topology, and you cant input an set which is part of an open cover of an open set of the topology that is not itself an open set of the topology
[23:42:21] <isekaijin> If U is an open subset of V, and V is an open subset of W, then U is also an open subset of W.
[23:42:29] <isekaijin> So there is nothing to worry about.,
[23:43:15] <isekaijin> In particular, if X is your space, U is an open subspace of X, then an open cover of U is formed by sets that happen to be open in X.
[23:43:30] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: that is exactly what i was asking, thank you
[23:43:45] <isekaijin> np
[23:43:52] <mycroftiv> you arent allowed to have an 'open cover of an open set on X' that is made of anything other than other open sets of X
[23:44:08] <isekaijin> Right.
[23:44:52] <isekaijin> But maybe this interacts with computability in funny ways. Perhaps there is a notion of “computably open” or “computable cover” or some other nonsense.
[23:45:08] <isekaijin> Thank goodness normal mathematics is not concerned with this!
[23:45:42] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: btw Lean has sheaves of modules and schemes and such formalized i recently learned
[23:46:03] <mycroftiv> they have a whole paper on their saga of making 3 different formalizations of sheaves
[23:46:11] <isekaijin> Yeah, a while back I read that they had formalized the notion of scheme.
[23:46:29] <isekaijin> Long enough ago that they should have formalized sheaves of (O_X)-modules by now.

[23:47:56] <mycroftiv> well, agda has cubical univalent type theory now, which is a whole different angle in some ways, so long term it might lead to great things
[23:48:26] <mycroftiv> for right now, if you want to do traditional mathematics with a proof assistant, lean is just winning the social competition to attract mathematicians to do the work
[23:48:53] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[23:49:37] <isekaijin> Just a few hours ago, my algebraic geometry professor *finally* convinced me that perhaps I should actually care about “simplicial nonsense”. Not idea how far this “simplicial nonsense” is from “cubical nonsense”.
[23:50:24] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: since you seem to prefer sensible and non-degenerate objects, simplexes and simplicial things have very appealing properties
[23:51:09] <mycroftiv> there is a deep conceptual connection between the world of constructive cubical type theory and the subset of topological spaces expressible as simpicial complexes
[23:52:23] <isekaijin> My professor's argument was like “Recall the universal bundle thing from algebraic topology? Super useful, right? You have an arbitrary G-bundle, and you know that it is a pullback of the universal bundle EG -> BG. Well, I have bad news for you. We have nothing like that in scheme-land. But we can sort of have it if you are willing to replace schemes with simplicial schemes.”
[23:52:48] <isekaijin> (Heavily paraphrasing. Any misunderstandings and inaccuracies are ine.)
[23:52:49] <isekaijin> mine*
[23:53:22] <mycroftiv> there is this idea of mathematical objects as data structures and interfaces that becomes apparent from working in a computer proof assistant in types

[23:54:25] <mycroftiv> so the idea that a lot of what you are doing in math is writing code to transport and transform data and you have libraries and APIs to convert things and sometimes you want to import some functions/data structures from another area of mathematics and need compatibility wrappers makes sense
[23:54:54] <isekaijin> Yeah, intuitively, it makes sense to anyone who has done both, math and programming.

[23:57:04] <mycroftiv> the variant uses of sheaves in algebraic geometry and in topos-logic are pretty mind breaking
[23:57:48] <isekaijin> Mmm, for implementing sheaves on a computer, it's probably better to take the more abstract approach of defining sheaves on an arbitrary site, and then recovering ordinary sheaves on topological spaces as a particular case.
[23:58:07] <isekaijin> I'm not sure what type to give to the opens of a topological space.
[23:58:12] <mycroftiv> yeah the Lean paper talks about how they went from more and more concrete to more and more categorical
