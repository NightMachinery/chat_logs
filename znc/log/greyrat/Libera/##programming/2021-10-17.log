[00:00:17] <manicennui> droid3: In postgres, VARCHAR is TEXT with a constraint. There are no performance differences.
[00:00:21] <phogg> the SQL standard doesn't specify a boolean type only because Oracle threw a fit about how you can't have a nullable bool
[00:00:30] <droid3> BigInt is confusing why they just stick with long , int ...etc
[00:01:00] <droid3> but not a huge deal it confuses it between when i work with java BigInteger i thought they had one for that lol. Just use either clob or blob ..

[00:01:44] <droid3> double and double precision confusing double should always be double precision and float single precision but whatever
[00:01:59] <phogg> postgres does the right thing: it lets you specify the logical type in the schema design (creating a table) and then you can control the specifics of performance separately

[00:02:49] <droid3> And TEXT is limited in some databases you got medium and long TEXT but looking up the size limits gives you what you want for those cases.
[00:03:53] <droid3> not nessarily sure why we got real and numeric 
[00:04:28] <droid3> but other then those i am getting pretty decent with these add data types of a database now 
[00:05:07] <droid3> unsigned types i think there ok but those can be achieve with regular int,long ,...etc and just adding a constraint to be all positive

[02:01:07] <droid3> yup it turns out LONGTEXT is the datatype for the largest strings for this particular database
[02:01:58] <droid3> it is as big max sizes as longblob and longclob which are more for binary objects or character objects
[02:03:36] <droid3> longtext , longblob, longclob all have the same size max limits so choosing longtext in my case just works better with strings.

[03:33:06] <[itchyjunk]> i dont
[03:33:13] <pulse> a few enemy types and a few defense types will do it
[03:33:17] <[itchyjunk]> well, he said a tower defense
[03:33:18] <pulse> well then it may be hard
[03:33:27] <[itchyjunk]> won't my towers and enemies need to be sprite?
[03:33:35] <pulse> not unless it's specified
[03:33:39] <pulse> you can make it ASCII
[03:33:40] <[itchyjunk]> have a path where enemy "walk" tower needs to detect it
[03:33:41] <[itchyjunk]> fire etc
[03:33:51] <pulse> i mean, preferably yes
[03:34:00] <pulse> but i see no problem making a simple terminal based game
[03:34:11] <pulse> but yes sprites are better
[03:34:28] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: With heavy guidance and a course structured around this, it can be done.  It can also be done by nerfing what counts as "tower defense" down to its bare essentials.
[03:34:31] <[itchyjunk]> even for terminal based, the tower has to have range etc
[03:34:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[03:34:49] <pulse> it all depends on experience. i could get a prototype going in a few hours
[03:34:50] <[itchyjunk]> well we saw swing like twice but we've not done anything significant with it
[03:34:54] <pulse> but if you don't have experience then it's a problem yes
[03:35:01] <[itchyjunk]> we made a gui that took a folder and listed all the files in it

[03:50:23] <jtgd> nitrix you're comparing two rectangles for overlap
[03:51:50] <nitrix> "Upper" usually refers to the upper two corners.

[03:53:12] <jtgd> upper is the parameter to the function
[03:53:40] <nitrix> AABB collisions is normally more like a.x < b.x + b.w && a.x + a.w > b.x && a.y < b.y + b.h && a.y + a.h > b.y
[03:54:26] <jtgd> these rectangles aren't with w and h, but top,bottom,left,right
[03:55:35] <nitrix> You get the width by the absolute difference between left/right and height with the absolute difference between top/bottom.
[03:55:53] <jtgd> right, but that is not how it's stored here.
[03:56:52] <nitrix> I'm aware, they shared their code and I opened the link.
[03:57:23] <nitrix> The question was whether that's a good collision test for rectangles and my recommendation is to use a different method.
[03:58:17] <nitrix> You typically store the x,y coordinate of the top-left corner and the width and height of the rectangle.
[03:58:23] <nitrix> You wouldn't recalculate the location of all four corners every time a transformation happens to the rectangle.

[04:01:18] <jtgd> I agree that storing origin + size is the preferred method, but that's what he has
[04:01:59] <nitrix> We're aware that's not what they have. They asked whether it was a good collision test, and no, no one does it like that.

[04:09:35] <smallvil_> an item above this item
[04:10:08] <jtgd> are you doing clipping, or collision detection (like in video games)
[04:10:45] <pulse> you're doing z indexing and collision at the same time?
[04:10:48] <smallvil_> eg if item A has a depth of 2, and item B has a depth of 3, then item A is an upper item of item B
[04:10:53] * pulse 's head spins

[04:35:33] <smallvil_> that way, if a layer contains a billion triangles, then only the layer itself needs to be occlusion tested, resulting in for example, 1 occlusion test instead of a billion occlusion tests
[04:36:15] <smallvil_> yea, that would be deduplication or merging
[04:36:27] <smallvil_> however that can be very complex
[04:36:52] <smallvil_> for example if a very long set of commands are sent twice with exactly the same data
[04:37:24] *** Joins: llh (~llh@user/llh)
[04:37:53] <smallvil_> it would be difficult and potentially expensive to determine if the commands can be merged as it basically needs to do region comparison of commands
[04:38:07] <smallvil_> eg if indexes 0 to 5 and 6 to 10 match exactly
[04:38:43] <smallvil_> accounting for commands that are arbitary long sequences, eg hundreds or millions of draw calls
[04:38:49] <Matt|home> so im looking at some in-game code for this object that lets you change source code for stuff, and this is so basic shit.. but im really tired.. here's the code
[04:38:57] <smallvil_> eg a very complex mesh could be drawn over itself twice

[04:46:00] <smallvil_> such as region reordering due to occlusion to make the tree smaller
[04:46:02] <Decker> heirarchy ends up with the graph of controls in a GUI/form sort of thing, but within that, the zorder is really just a list, or a number

[05:12:23] <manicennui> HEY LOOK AT THIS THING
[05:12:24] <manicennui> Fuck off
[05:13:21] <smallvil_> well, in that case, if large is transparent then only the first small and medium are drawn since the small covers the medium which covers the small and the medium
[05:13:56] <Decker> there's no requiremtn that the second is covered by the first
[05:14:07] <Decker> both mediums do not themselves collide except in A
[05:14:14] <Decker> (the large)
[05:14:40] <smallvil_> then it depends on the position and size of what ever is directly underneath each layer
[05:15:39] <Decker> that's why it's a heirarchy :)
[05:15:51] <smallvil_> it might be easier to think of it as holes instead, as to relate to both depth and size
[05:16:10] <smallvil_> wait no, holes are transparent

[05:16:41] <smallvil_> hmmm

[10:36:23] <dodo> also think about when and how each step can fail
[10:36:59] <PamiPetteri> the resource 'A' can be variable, like int variable, or int counter
[10:38:11] <PamiPetteri> I think the omega-rpg source code tries a "mutex style" solution by calling lock_score_file(); and unlock_score_file(); but the code is buggy and I had to fix it myself by hand.
[10:39:43] <PamiPetteri> so there is a resource that needs to be available to 1 resource per thread a time, and for that the mutex is good. when the other thread releases the resources, the second thread can use it. only 1 access per 1 thread for the resource, be it a file or a variable.

[12:12:43] <GeDaMo> Scotland
[12:13:12] <godSend23> very cool
[12:13:39] <godSend23> can u interpret what this statement means, "If someone were to write the code to extract them from the YouTube description, and somehow pack them into the container (provided it even supports chapters)
[12:13:56] <godSend23> what's the "container" reference to?
[12:13:59] <digdilem> dreicht rain or drookit?
[12:14:31] <GeDaMo> Container probably means the video format

[19:22:49] <mrig> Decker Thanks this is quite nice once configured to hide the widgits :)
[19:23:05] <Decker> oui :)
[19:23:21] <Decker> it's got good defaults too - and some themes ?
[19:23:22] <mrig> Amazing how much dissconnect there is between mouse and keyboard use.
[19:23:39] <Decker> (and touch?)
[19:23:53] <Decker> what about trackpad or trackball?  (or trackpad with momenum so it is a trackball)
[19:24:04] <mrig> I just set the green on black theme and have managed to hide most of the widget parts that remain lite in colour.
[19:24:33] <Decker> good choice :)
[19:24:51] <mrig> Thing is for things like the symbol that shows when you are scrolled up, nice touch, but it is not there when yo uare scrolled up by keyboard not by mouse :|
[19:25:26] <Decker> ?? I'm pretty sure it's on the state of the scrollbar
[19:25:31] <Decker> so either way is the same 
[19:25:40] <mrig> I think this is pretty much due to the way that most widget libs are written, that they dont really seem to encourage continuity between the mouse and keyboard.
[19:25:57] <mrig> dang the latest debian with GNOME is aweful for this too.
[19:26:36] <Decker> how do yo uscroll with the mouse that it's not there?
[19:26:41] <mrig> if you do things with the keyboard not the mouse, it leaves the mouse pointer visible in the middle of the screen with no aauto hiding.
[19:27:01] <mrig> I have the auto display of the scroll bar.

[20:37:37] <Gamara> Decker that seems kind of rough to implement lol
[20:37:51] <Decker> pulse exactly - STL that escaped me :) (MFC)  and uhmm Boost - so many people just can't live without Boost and that's ginormous compared to .NET :)  (at least it feels that way when building it for some small date function that could have been header-only and might be now)
[20:37:54] <Mangy_Dog> so i assumed that the main project name namespace is kinda like the main in c# in vs
[20:38:13] <pulse> Decker, ugh, MFC is horrible
[20:38:25] <Decker> Gamara indeed.... second there's a freetype.js that does a good job of using fonts...
[20:38:40] <pulse> Decker, .NET is nice as far as featureset goes
[20:38:45] <Decker> pulse it was rather pointless since it was just wrappers for the C WIN32API 
[20:39:00] <vdamewood> GeDaMo Mangy_Dog: So, in Java and C# every static value and function has to be in a class. The example code has a free function it.
[20:39:07] <Decker> and generic containers (STL-esque)
[20:39:08] <pulse> well, it was supposed to make win32 easier. it only managed to make it far more convoluted though
[20:39:13] <Gamara> I will check it out decker thanks
[20:39:18] <GeDaMo> Mangy_Dog: is it any different if you remove the "using LibreHardwareMonitor.Hardware;"
[20:39:18] <Decker> right
[20:39:27] <Decker> their callback state model was half baked :)
[20:39:34] <Mangy_Dog> that throws more errors
[20:39:41] <Decker> really need scope contexts with contexts to make that work reasonably well (JS)
[20:39:43] <Mangy_Dog> if i remove that
[20:39:45] <pulse> MFC is just horribly designed if you ask me
[20:39:49] <Mangy_Dog> as its needed to get all the hardware monitoring stuff
[20:40:02] <pulse> and overcomplicated. the intent was good but the implementation was not
[20:40:15] <pulse> that's probably one of the motivations for .NET i imagine
[20:40:31] <pulse> but now you have a JVM-like layer in between the OS and your app, which i'm not a fan of
[20:40:32] *** onion is now known as zzz
[20:40:39] <Decker> one thing I miss is on-insert/delete events for List<>
[20:40:40] <pulse> it is pretty nice though
[20:40:41] <vdamewood> Mangy_Dog: Change public void Monitor() to public static void Monitor() and paste that function into the same class your main function is in (for now). Paste the rest above the class below the namespace stuff.
[20:40:45] <Decker> wish JS had that on []
[20:40:57] <pulse> at least as far as RAD programming goes. it's simple and nice to use
[20:41:27] <pulse> i do wonder why classic VB is #11 on Tiobe though, LOL
[20:41:38] <pulse> is there really so much VB6 legacy code
[20:41:40] <vdamewood> pulse: Because legacy code.
[20:41:43] <vdamewood> Yes.
[20:41:53] <pulse> isn't classic VB horrifically unsafe
[20:41:55] <Decker> .NET let me make a form, that when I typed in the field, the value propagated all the way to the database live-like... the problem was notifying other consumers of that SQL data that an event happened
[20:41:55] <GeDaMo> Why isn't Cobol higher then? :P

[20:43:03] <Mangy_Dog> put it inside the update visitor class?
[20:43:42] <Decker> the class is just a class though... something else should be using that from like Program.cs (program.cs does typically contain that static main function)
[20:43:51] <Decker> which your gist had... 
[20:43:51] <vdamewood> Mangy_Dog. No the Program class.

[21:05:53] <vdamewood> The pitch isusually determined by how frequently the device moves, so paper usually doesn't matter.

[23:27:59] <mawk> for every element a you can find k such that 2^k = a mod 11
[23:28:03] <[itchyjunk]> aren't generators primitive roots?
[23:28:06] <mawk> yeah
[23:28:13] <mawk> generators of (Z_11; Ã—)
[23:28:21] <mawk> it's synonym with primitive root
[23:28:25] <[itchyjunk]> -,- so wouldn't my log thing make sense for any a \in Z/11Z ?
[23:28:34] *** Joins: eem (~eem@user/eem)
[23:28:40] <mawk> because not all a are generators of (Z_11; Ã—)
[23:29:09] <mawk> 11 is prime so all elements are invertible, but that doesn't mean they're all generators
[23:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> oh + and *
[23:29:21] <mawk> yeah
[23:29:26] <[itchyjunk]> those are too small to notice, damnit
[23:29:31] <mawk> lol
[23:29:46] <mawk> the log thing works like you expect with particular bases, like 2 for instance
[23:29:58] <mawk> 2 is a primitive root

[23:31:25] <mawk> and 7 = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:31:32] <mawk> so now you can take the log base 2 both sides [itchyjunk] 
[23:32:05] <[itchyjunk]> right, i vaguely remember
[23:32:11] <mawk> 5^x = 7 mod 11 => 2^(4x) = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:32:16] <mawk> so take it both sides, you get 4x = -3
[23:32:20] <[itchyjunk]> i did a few group problems. i asked you for hello world of group theory which you never game me
[23:32:21] <mawk> but...mod 10
[23:32:23] <mawk> not mod 11
[23:32:25] <[itchyjunk]> but fangs came to the rescue
[23:32:39] <pyzozord> oh wow that xkcd flew completly over my head
[23:32:42] <mawk> you understand why mod 10
[23:32:53] <pyzozord> I didn't know there was no such thing as "conjection"
[23:32:53] <mawk> there are only 10 elements in the group (Z_11*; Ã—)
[23:32:56] <mawk> 0 isn't one of them

[23:33:28] <[itchyjunk]> i dont think i do. i drank coffee and i am too hyper to think
[23:33:36] <mawk> it's euler's theorem
[23:33:39] <[itchyjunk]> no i don't
[23:33:41] <[itchyjunk]> oh yeah
[23:33:46] *** Joins: mrig (~mriga_@user/mrig)
[23:33:47] <[itchyjunk]> i vaguely remember it
[23:33:47] <mawk> it's a generalization of the a^(p-1) = 1 mod p
[23:33:55] <mawk> when p is prime
[23:34:00] <[itchyjunk]> right eulers phi function that gives me the coprimes of n
[23:34:15] <mawk> yeah
[23:34:34] <mawk> so now with the log we got 4x + 3 = 0 mod 10 [itchyjunk] 
[23:34:42] <mawk> but gcd(4, 10) != 1
[23:34:56] <mawk> so our hope is thin
[23:35:15] <[itchyjunk]> 4x + 3 = 0 mod 10 is a random example?
[23:35:20] <mawk> no
[23:35:32] <mawk> it's the continuation of the exercise
[23:35:32] *** Quits: GeDaMo (~GeDaMo@user/gedamo) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:35:39] <mawk> we had 2^(4n) = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:35:45] <mawk> so 4n = -3 mod 10
[23:36:00] <mawk> or 4n + 3 = 0 mod 10
[23:36:01] <mawk> by taking the log base 2 both sides
[23:37:18] <[itchyjunk]> mawk> 5^x = 7 mod 11 => 2^(4x) = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:37:22] <[itchyjunk]> don't understand
[23:37:32] <[itchyjunk]> so 7 = -3 mod 11
[23:37:42] <mawk> [itchyjunk]: 5 = 2^4
[23:37:45] <mawk> and 7 = 2^(-3)
[23:37:48] <[itchyjunk]> so 2^(5^x) = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:37:57] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[23:37:58] <mawk> no no
[23:38:09] <mawk> in 5^x = 7 mod 11, you replace 5 by 2^4 and 7 by 2^(-3)
[23:38:32] <[itchyjunk]> i can't just raise both sides to 2^ ?
[23:38:32] <mawk> when everything is in base 2 you can take the log, since 2 is a primitive root
[23:38:42] <mawk> why raise
[23:38:51] <mawk> you already have a power, you want to lower it
[23:38:54] <mawk> you have 5^x
[23:39:12] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.224) (Quit: Haxxa flies away.)
[23:39:17] <[itchyjunk]> okay i understand what you did there at least
[23:39:34] <[itchyjunk]> <mawk> so 4n = -3 mod 10
[23:39:37] <[itchyjunk]> i dont understand this now
[23:39:43] <mawk> and we convert it to base 2 by noticing that 2^4 = 5, so 5^x = (2^4)^x = 2^(4x)
[23:39:51] <[itchyjunk]> right
[23:39:59] <mawk> well we have 2^(4n) = 2^(-7) mod 11
[23:40:01] *** Quits: Gamara (~Gamara@66-203-186-178.ded.execulink.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:40:05] <mawk> so both powers are equal
[23:40:13] <mawk> no sorry it's -3 not -7
[23:40:22] <mawk> 2^(4n) = 2^(-3) mod 11
[23:40:24] <mawk> right [itchyjunk] ?
[23:40:28] <mawk> so 4n = -3
[23:40:37] <[itchyjunk]> 4n = -3 yes but mod 10 part i don't get
[23:40:46] <mawk> well it's the little fermat theorem

[23:40:57] <mawk> a^(p-1) = 1 mod p
[23:41:11] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[23:41:17] <mawk> that means in a^x you reduce the exponent mod p-1
[23:41:28] <mawk> since a^(p-1) = a^0
[23:41:43] <[itchyjunk]> no habla
[23:41:50] <mawk> little fermat theorem
[23:41:54] <mawk> a^(p-1) = 1 mod p
[23:41:55] <mawk> ok?
[23:41:59] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[23:42:08] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.224)
[23:42:33] <mawk> so in a^n, if the exponent n is A + (p-1)B, that means a^n = a^(A + (p-1)B) = a^A * (a^(p-1))^B = a^A
[23:42:38] *** Quits: ixil (~ixil@82.197.178.137) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:42:44] <mawk> in a^n mod p, we reduce the exponent n mod p-1
[23:43:01] <mawk> that's what the little fermat theorem means
[23:43:08] <mawk> ok [itchyjunk] ?
[23:44:00] <mawk> a^(p-1) = a^0; so in the "exponent space", p-1 = 0
[23:44:29] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[23:44:35] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:44:50] <[itchyjunk]> okay so i get 4n = -2 mod p-1
[23:44:58] <[itchyjunk]> -3*
[23:45:03] <[itchyjunk]> mod 10*
[23:45:07] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d43f3a.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[23:45:10] <mawk> it's -3 but yes
[23:45:10] <mawk> 4n = -3 mod 10
[23:45:15] <mawk> yeah
[23:45:29] <mawk> but 4n mod 10 is always even
[23:45:38] <mawk> it does 0 4 8 2 6 0 4 8 2 6 0 4 8 2 6 0 4 8 2 6 ...
[23:46:11] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[23:46:41] <mawk> so it can never be -3 (which is 7 mod 10)
[23:46:42] <mawk> so no solutions
[23:47:16] <mawk> see, it was an easy problem
[23:47:46] <mawk> you can use the same trick to solve problems like 5^(7^(9^x)) mod 11
[23:47:48] <pyzozord> the fact that there exists a easy solution does not make a problem easy :P
[23:48:05] <mawk> or "find the last digit of 7^2021"
[23:48:13] <[itchyjunk]> wait, you asked what use log was
[23:48:18] <[itchyjunk]> then found a solution using log?
[23:48:29] <mawk> it's not really using log, it's using the concept of log
[23:48:45] <mawk> there's no discrete log button on your calculator, you can't really "use it" like you use the real log
[23:48:45] <[itchyjunk]> -,-
[23:49:10] <mawk> the trick here was just to express the problem using a primitive root, 2, which we know we can bring down the exponent
[23:49:26] <mawk> with a generator/primitive root g, if g^a = g^b mod p then a = b mod p-1
[23:49:48] <[itchyjunk]> isn't descrete log a function like any other function?
[23:50:00] <[itchyjunk]> calculator is a filthy thing those engineers use
[23:50:03] <[itchyjunk]> what do i care for it?
[23:50:19] <mawk> sure, but it's not computable like the real log
[23:51:09] <[itchyjunk]> you could write some code to compute it?
[23:51:19] <[itchyjunk]> is this what algebra solvers are used for?
