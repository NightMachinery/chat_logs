[01:25:14] <sonny> I am trying to understand the output of gnutls-cli <https://clbin.com/eZSGB>, the interesting info is on the status line
[01:25:34] <sonny> the certs seem to be in order
[01:26:29] <sonny> according to the docs the files in gnutls-trustfiles are checked, so if those file names are checked as is, then yeah those certs are not on my system
[01:28:34] <sonny> c-x c-f / opens to c:/, so I guess I have to get those files somehow
[01:28:45] <corwin> I tried to mimic what I think happens internally using that var and I can see, indeed, we don't seem to have any valid CRT/POM files found under windows: (gnutls--get-files '("/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt" "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem" "/usr/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt" "/usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt" "/etc/ssl/cert.pem" "/etc/certs/ca-certificates.crt"))
[01:29:02] <sonny> which would be provided by cygwin (according to docs)
[01:29:18] <corwin> I also looked at my Emacs sources and I don't see where any are included, so..
[01:29:33] <sonny> corwin: what do you recommend?
[01:29:40] <corwin> I guess maybe windows users (currently?) need to arrange to get these certs somehow and then customize the var?

[02:20:33] <corwin> sonny: not sure yet.. open to ideas.  I guess my thought was to add something that detects that we are running under windows, looks for bash on the path and, if both of those tests succeed, prepend the root path to each of the directories listed in gnutls-trustfiles.
[02:21:51] <sonny> that's simple enough, windows provides an OS env var
[02:22:47] <corwin> i'm using it all over in my init scripts already
[02:22:56] <sonny> checking for bash is tricky, it'd have to be specific to the installation. E.g. I installed git recently, and it comes with bash

[05:40:56] <aidalgol> diffusion and rate of diffusion.

[06:38:24] <bpalmer> Any distinction between gender and sex is pretty meaningless at birth in most cases; the choice of the parents in how to represent the child is most likely identical to how the sex is labelled. I don't see any point in quibbling.

[08:58:54] <bpalmer> I'm not going to claim to be a DBMS expert but a lot of the complaints about mysql/maria seem obviously over the top; I've seen them used in some very high performance situations
[08:59:25] <corwin> I use MYSQL is some pretty heavy hitting apps.
[08:59:31] <bpalmer> if you're just writing data to disk as fast as you can, they're perfectly fine; you may specifically not want things like triggers or foreign key constraints to be applied at the writing-to-disk stage.
[08:59:53] <corwin> That aligns well to my use-cases.
[09:00:14] <twb> bpalmer: i.e. "you can tune mysql to be wrong very quickly"
[09:00:19] <twb> You can do that with postgres as well
[09:00:28] <bpalmer> And, in any comparison that praises postgres and sqlite but not mysql/maria makes me even more skeptical, because sqlite is limited in some really obvious ways
[09:00:34] <bpalmer> It has, what, 4 standard datatypes?

[17:16:19] <bkhl> Kind of like my experience of SO, except I deleted my account as well.
[17:16:49] <rpav> my usual first pass at "should i ask about this in some forum or not" is "if i searched for it, would i find the answer," and while, fairly, it's almost always the case that you can search for something and find the answer these days, that just means it's probably best to start there ;)

[17:17:13] <bkhl> Not sure how successful they have been.

[17:21:32] <rpav> there seem to be a surprising number of duplicates as well
[17:22:18] <rpav> https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/how-to/get-keys-mongodb-collection/ was the third result which looks similar but more in-depth and using python/shell/etc
[17:22:31] <bkhl> Yeah, so that seems to indicate that having a mob of people being rude at people posting duplicates is not completely successful.
[17:22:37] <thomasb06> but the collection are hundreds so I'm not going to do all of them by hand. But well, I can adapt this piece of code for sure.
[17:22:57] <rpav> bkhl: not being completely successful is far from failing
[17:23:21] <bkhl> Sure, but it's been enough for the company running SO to be concerned and trying to change the culture.
[17:23:29] <rpav> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:23:37] <thomasb06> maybe I can do a Python script rather than using the shell... Good idea
[17:23:43] <rpav> if being rude makes someone think twice about posting next time, they've accomplished their goal
[17:23:56] <bkhl> Yeah, that sort of attitude among a lot of users is the problem.
[17:24:03] <rpav> (and my guess is "rude" here isn't)
[17:24:07] <bkhl> It makes the first experience of many users negative.
[17:24:41] <bkhl> Which is why their community managers were concerned I guess and wrote an article that got a lot of attention.

[17:54:30] <wasamasa> from this I can conclude that using calc to do library-level arithmetic is a bad idea

[18:58:31] <rpav> ski: i'm not 100% sure you actually need that evaluated before the `match` in this case either .. form-walking is generally considered bad practice because it requires too much code; rather MATCH should generate code itself .. in this case, for example, you could implement the MATCH dsl (which presumably `vector` is a part) by macroletting VECTOR, and the code generated would evaluate (my-macro ..) before _that_ was evaluated

[19:01:36] <rpav> ski: no, that's my point .. your DSL should not just be a function called `MATCH` which does a lot of form-walking of its body, but rather `MATCH` generates code where `VECTOR` and other matchers are functions/macros, and that all becomes code itself

[19:19:09] <rpav> ski: right, but the "right" (i.e. good/easy/idiomatic) way to do this is by not implementing a new evaluator on top of lisp, but by writing your DSL such that it fits into lisp evaluation as-is

[21:14:08] <acdw> that's a good question lol
[21:14:08] <wasamasa> there's a useless C macro checking whether the reader uses get-file-char or get-emacs-mule-file-char

[21:14:41] <acdw> it's not an sexp comment, but a block comment
[21:14:41] <wasamasa> right, it's kind of a block comment
[21:14:55] <acdw> well that's weird and cursed lol

[21:15:07] <wasamasa> > Don't use this yourself.
[21:15:17] <acdw> yah
[21:15:19] <acdw> too bad
[21:15:28] <acdw> can we add reader macros to elisp? i'm thinking probably not
[21:15:39] <wasamasa> if you use a homegrown reader, sure
