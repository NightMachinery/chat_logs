[01:00:54] <greycat> In any kind of terminal, pressing Tab sends the \011 (0x09) byte, the same as pressing Ctrl-I.  But in a windowing environment, the two are distinct.
[01:00:55] <twkm> i.e., your terminal sends the same code for both, so no you cannot bind them separately, but if you change your terminal to send different codes you can bind them to do different things.

[02:27:14] <Riviera> neshpion: hm, but a literal ^J is a newline character
[02:28:22] <Riviera> neshpion: when you type ^V^M you prevent something from happening, like preventing the terminal driver or the editor from modifying the ^M character and inserting a newline instead (which is what happens when I type ^M in vim).

[03:24:46] <arkanoid> maybe one day I will leave gnu for bsd. I do remember the OS professor @ university saying how linux was bad compared to bsd, but somehow the first gave me multiple job opportunities somehow, but not bsd. That's sad.

[03:28:40] <twkm> linus is willing to completely change a kernel api sometimes without quite the sematic version change you'd expect, where bsd's tend to maintain an api as long as possible (preferrably forever).

[04:44:39] <Intruder777> please suggest the proper commands and piping: I need to take first 100 bytes of each *.txt file in a directory and then grep in those bytes some pattern and then, as a result, I need list of matching files names. I know I can do `head -c 100` but how do I properly pipe it to grep so I get files names as a resulting output?
[04:44:46] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[04:46:16] <omegatron> do head -c 100 for each file and store the result in a file named similar (such as FILE.head) then grep over those files and postprocess this output
[04:46:33] <omegatron> afterwards remove those .head files
[04:46:53] <Intruder777> no way to do it on the fly, without creating temp files?
[04:47:14] <omegatron> tell me, if you come up with a one-liner .. next year
[04:47:32] <Intruder777> why next year? because it's almost not possible?
[04:47:50] <koala_man> for f in ./*.txt; do head -c 100 "$f" | grep -q pattern && echo "Matching file: $f"; done
[04:50:48] <omegatron> because such stuff is easier and better to administrate (at least for me) to write as a small function, whether if its done with temp files or not ..   with one-liners and no accompanying documentation you might have forgotten next month, what this thing does exactly when you see it somewhere  ( unless it's for a one-time job )
[04:52:07] <Intruder777> koala_man: thanks, I run it, but looks like it either hangs, or waits for user input

[18:22:51] <chronon> Filenames *often* contain whitespace.

[18:53:40] <chronon> For me it refreshes the screen.
[18:54:14] <chronon> I also set it up to clear the search highlight but that's my own customisation. The refresh is built-in to vim.
[18:54:32] <llua> it inserts an ^L into the buffer in vi
[18:54:43] <chronon> Only in insert mode.
[18:54:51] <ormaaj> chronon: have been using vi mode for years. vi mode is the only one posix requires in fact.
[18:55:05] <chronon> Cool.
[18:55:40] <chronon> So to those of you using vi mode, is there a simple way to think about it that will open the door for me?
[18:56:02] <chronon> Get me over the initial hurdle of confusion.
[18:56:17] <llua> you default in insert mode 
[18:56:28] <chronon> It's not that I am a novice vim user, far from it, but somehow bash/readline is confusing.
[18:57:05] <chronon> Ah, so if I hit escape and then ^L things will work as expected?
[18:59:21] <ormaaj> I think understanding how the readline and bash's `bind` mechanism work in general would be the goal. The modes are just preset profiles.
[18:59:36] <chronon> If only the prompt changed to indicate the command/insert mode.
[19:00:03] <llua> i mean, if you are inserting characters by typing them one would assume that you are in insert mode

[23:01:33] *** Quits: malina (~malina@user/malina) (Quit: malina)

[23:03:08] <bougyman> that was the first hit on google. It's mostly using pcre-enabled grep.
[23:03:10] <bougyman> so ymmv
[23:03:43] <greycat> do you actually mean *multi-byte UTF-8* characters?
[23:03:49] <lesshaste> grep --color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]" file.xml
[23:03:50] <lesshaste>  works

[23:05:40] <greycat> the range of bytes that can initiate a multi-byte char in UTF-8 is much narrower than x80 to xff.
[23:06:11] <fling> does not work here ^
[23:06:18] <lesshaste> oh
[23:06:29] <lesshaste> what should it be?

[23:07:38] <fling> yes
[23:07:46] <lesshaste> LC_ALL=C echo '소녀시대' | grep -P "[\x80-\xFF]" also returns nothing

[23:09:42] <fling> thanks for the idea
[23:10:05] <lesshaste> what has changed in the question?
[23:11:36] <greycat> if I re-read fling's suggestion as "filter out lines that are all-ASCII" then I suppose nothing changed, but you still need to override LC_something to force individual bytes to be looked at

[23:31:52] <thebombzen> what's the proper way to do $0 properly?
[23:31:59] <thebombzen> in BASH specifically
[23:32:18] <phy1729> What does do mean here?
[23:32:18] <greycat> echo "usage: $0 [-abc] file [file ...]"
[23:32:25] <greycat> that's what $0 is usable for
[23:33:10] <OMGOMG> that question sounds a bit masturbatory
[23:33:26] <greycat> I'm expecting a !faq location + plonk soon
[23:34:48] <greycat> thebombzen: what are you trying to do?
[23:35:13] <thebombzen> I mean, I've been told that $0 is unreliable and doesn't always refer to the script itself
[23:35:18] <earnestly> Although don't use $0 like that
[23:35:24] <earnestly> Give your program a name, and use that string
[23:35:25] <thebombzen> and that there's some bash-specific variable that you should use intead
[23:35:32] <greycat> thebombzen: what are you trying to do?
[23:35:42] <thebombzen> I'm trying to locate the script on the filesystem
[23:35:46] <greycat> Why?
[23:35:57] <thebombzen> because I want to know where the script is located on the filesystem
[23:36:01] <greycat> !faq location
[23:36:01] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/028 -- How do I determine the location of my script?  I want to read some config files from the same place.
[23:36:03] <greycat> *plonk*
[23:36:12] <greycat> Good to know my ESP is still on traget.
[23:36:12] <twkm> what will you do if it is located 15 places?
[23:36:14] <earnestly> thebombzen: Before you get too far into this, keep in mind that the solution is for your design to not need to know where the script is run from
[23:36:43] <earnestly> thebombzen: If that means environments, arguments, etc. then fine.  But scripts in general should be agnostic to their "location" (try to forgot this concept even exists)
[23:36:44] <thebombzen> the issue in this case is I want the script to call itself to work around the lack of scoping that bash provides
[23:37:06] <thebombzen> since recursion doesn't really work well with bash's bad scoping
[23:37:11] <phy1729> Ok so backup and what's the actual problem
[23:37:32] <phy1729> Sounds like you just need to local some variables
[23:37:39] <twkm> probably better to use another language or design for the language used rather than the language you hoped it'd be.
[23:37:45] *** Quits: totenkoph (~scythe@gateway/tor-sasl/totenkoph) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[23:38:22] <thebombzen> the actual problem is that I have a script that does a task on a particular kind of file, but the file could be a compound file, in which case I'd like to explode the file, call the script on each component, and then reassemble it
[23:38:32] <thebombzen> the problem with just putting that logic in a function is that it screws up my cleanup routines
[23:38:45] <phy1729> screws up how
[23:39:31] <thebombzen> because of scope issues, I'd have to rewrite all of my logic so my "original files" and "backup files" and similar things becomes arrays to restore
[23:39:49] <thebombzen> it sounds like a much simpler task to just call the script again
[23:40:22] <earnestly> The dark corner is fractal indeed
[23:40:25] <phy1729> Sounds like a function with local'd vars should work
[23:40:40] <thebombzen> well if I local them then my exit trap won't see them if the script is interrupted
[23:40:46] <thebombzen> so for that purpose they want to be global
[23:41:13] <earnestly> I think at this point there's no reasonable way forward without seeing the work
[23:41:27] <phy1729> I guess you could use a subshell instead
[23:41:48] <thebombzen> how would that work
[23:43:07] <fling> Or you can put all your variables into an array instead.
[23:43:11] <fling> And grow it as you go deeper.
[23:43:12] <phy1729> It may work to not local and run the child funcs in a subshell, but I honesly don't know how traps and subshells interact
