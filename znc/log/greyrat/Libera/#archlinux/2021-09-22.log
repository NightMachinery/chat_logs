[11:11:39] <Keij0> I have Ryzen 7 5700G on Asus B550-I Strix 
[11:11:50] <Keij0> and I can't switch from HDMI Audio to headphones

[11:46:22] <jtgd> My only issue is kernel 5.1.7 dropped support of my video card so I am stuck on 5.1.5, though I don't have problems... yet
[11:46:29] <rabbitnightmare3> mate is ok, but newer sofrware is beginning to show its cracks

[11:47:52] <coruja> some time ago i stated that it doesn't matter much which distro you use when having found out that they all can be tailored down to the system that fits your needs but one advantage of arch is that it doesn't get into your way too much when doing so
[11:48:17] <jtgd> thanks, I've been looking for advice of what's the best video card to get. I don't need super fancy, like for games, but I think longevity of support would be my #1.
[11:48:38] <rabbitnightmare3> radron 400 series is regarded as a gold standard
[11:48:52] <Hazoune> what video card is it, jtgd?
[11:48:52] <jtgd> ok, cool. I what way?
[11:48:54] <rabbitnightmare3> 450 if you can find them are nice

[12:19:40] <Tom^> elichai2: well it depends, are you using nvidia when it dies?
[12:19:48] <Tom^> otherwise i would say no

[12:20:25] <kailo> when I call xrandr, it seems like the 2k modes (60 and 75hz) are displaying in a different section (hdmi-0 has all of the available modes, but the 2k modes appear under DVI-I-3, which is unused)

[12:21:27] <kailo> I tried manually removing the 2k modes, and adding the correct timings etc, newmode works but continues to place it under DVI-I-3 rather than hdmi, and I can't bind it to hdmi-0 with addmode

[12:21:37] <Tom^> elichai2: thats new enough you can skip bumblebee entirerly and use nvidia's prime instead.

[21:05:23] <Luyin> hi, my dark theme for the GUI seems to be broken. I used to have everything in dark, like Thunar, evince... all used a dark theme (I can't remember which, but I think it was Arc-Dark) - now, when I select this theme (or any other, for that matter) in xfce4-appearance-settings, nothing changes, particularly the theme doesn't get dark. This has started occurring a few days ago after an update -
[21:05:25] <Luyin> the last update before was maybe a week earlier. Not sure what exactly is broken here. How do I even go about figuring this out?
