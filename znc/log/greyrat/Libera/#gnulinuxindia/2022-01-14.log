[09:09:09] <MohdAariz[m]> ye
[09:09:27] <pystardust> it doesn't have much features, if you want features looks at irssi, even it can open images
[09:09:54] <MohdAariz[m]> i have irssi
[09:10:00] <MohdAariz[m]> gtlsgamer helped set it upfor me
[09:10:09] <pystardust> it has a plugin or something to open images
[09:10:20] <MohdAariz[m]> thanks
[09:11:00] <pystardust> irssi is better in many aspects, but catgirl is good if you don't want to tinker and just have something minimal
[09:11:26] <MohdAariz[m]> imma try irssi first
[09:12:53] <MohdAariz[m]> there doesn't seem to be a plugin for opening images

[09:50:20] <NeoVoid[m]> example. institutional courses teachers like redhat. They never brag their student about how linux is better than windows as their student too nube to know what a operating system is and so they themselves too when they were students like them and being taught by teacher of the same curriculams product which boring and less exciting to tell those anwaredly lucky guyz who doesnt have any idea what invaluable diamond they were practicing
[09:50:20] <NeoVoid[m]> on toward high salary career. Which They arent being awared of which true value is.
[09:51:33] <MohdAariz[m]> i started using linux when i didn't even knew how to use dwm

[10:26:04] <AnkanRoy[m]> any good doc link explaining how. to turn old computer into an linux server that can take http request..

[10:38:46] <gtlsgamr> are you located in india
[10:38:48] <gtlsgamr> ?
[10:52:08] <AnkanRoy[m]> yes
[10:54:37] <gtlsgamr> first you should check your ISP if they provide open port
[10:54:45] <gtlsgamr> if they don't then you will have to set up tunneling
[10:54:48] <gtlsgamr> it is hard, but possible
[10:57:56] <AnkanRoy[m]> f i thought it will be as simple as Installing Ubuntu server and just downloding nginx.
[10:57:56] <AnkanRoy[m]> thx for telling(„Éªo„Éª)
[10:58:32] <AnkanRoy[m]> i am using jio Mobile network. is their any possibility

[11:43:04] <vlad[m]> :monkaS:

[12:12:14] <vlad[m]> yeah sure will keep in mind
[12:12:23] <gtlsgamr> mysticbtw[m]: even if you delete it later, it stays in IRC.
[12:12:46] <gtlsgamr> at least to whoever is connected right now. If they are using a bouncer, it will stay for longer.
[12:13:15] <mysticbtw[m]> Got it! Completely understandable

[14:25:25] <theo[m]> codeberg pages didn't have support for custom domains back then, but they are supported now
[14:25:32] <AryaBackup[m]> ask in their matrix room

[15:07:34] <Tor[m]> <Govindas[m]> "they're pretty different" <- Ok but the experience is similar to fluffchat compared to element 
[15:08:18] <AryaBackup[m]> not at all
[15:08:28] <AryaBackup[m]> fluffychat is flutter and has 0 features
[15:08:38] <AryaBackup[m]> schildi has more features than element lol
[15:08:51] <Govindas[m]> fluffychat is very good if they add some missing element features
[15:09:53] <AnkanRoy[m]> Tor[m]: it was intentional and totally not an mistake
[15:16:48] <vlad[m]> i liked weechat
[16:01:11] <theo[m]> guys, is there a thingy for the line above like ^ for the beginning of the line and $ for the end of the line in regex?

[18:57:13] <iamak[m]> Can someone recommend me a good FOSS video calling app? My requirement is that my friends should not need to download it. Browser se hona chahiye. And that it should support screen sharing.
[18:57:53] <AryaBackup[m]> jitsi ftw
[18:58:08] <AryaBackup[m]> i have been using it for video calls with my friends for a while now
[18:58:23] <iamak[m]> It supports via browser?
[18:58:29] <AryaBackup[m]> yes of cousre
[18:58:43] <AryaBackup[m]> or if you are a gigachad use mumble (there are third party webclients) and screensy.marijn.it
[18:58:44] <AryaBackup[m]> üôÇ
[18:58:49] <iamak[m]> Okay thanks
[18:59:11] <iamak[m]> AryaBackup[m]: Idk what this is
[18:59:39] <iamak[m]> Arch package exists for jitsi
[18:59:42] <iamak[m]> * for jitsi?
[18:59:42] <AryaBackup[m]> mumble is voice only old-school softwaer
[18:59:49] <AryaBackup[m]> iamak[m]: thats an electron wrapper
[18:59:50] <AryaBackup[m]> for jitsi
[19:00:14] <AryaBackup[m]> i want to host my own jitsi instance but it requires udp which i can not tunnel
[19:00:47] <iamak[m]> How do I use it? Eli5 pls
[19:01:45] <AryaBackup[m]> go to meet.jit.si/SomeRandomStringYouCanPutAnythingHere
[19:01:50] <AryaBackup[m]> and just start
[19:02:40] <iamak[m]> Thanks
[19:02:54] <AryaBackup[m]> i usually generate a random string from /dev/random
[19:03:25] <gtlsgamr> me and pystardust use screency + mumble
[19:04:36] <AryaBackup[m]> normies wont use that :P
[19:04:58] <iamak[m]> AryaBackup[m]: üòÇ
[19:05:10] <vlad[m]> how does jitsi work
[19:09:13] <iamak[m]> <gtlsgamr> "me and pystardust use screency +..." <- What's this?
[19:12:22] <gtlsgamr> screensy 4 screen sharing + mumble for voice chat
[19:26:13] <AryaBackup[m]> random() { tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c ${1:-10}; }
[19:26:28] <AryaBackup[m]> this is what i use for the random
