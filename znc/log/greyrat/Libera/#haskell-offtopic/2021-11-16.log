[23:03:26] <[exa]> probably
[23:04:01] <[exa]> I find it kinda interesting, given how _easy_ it would be to literally write issues and comments to the file, with comments and everything
[23:04:26] <[exa]> perhaps the killer feature is elsewhere, such as random strangers opening le issue from the cellphone
[23:05:27] <[exa]> okay I'm going to be a bit hyperactive
[23:05:35] <[exa]> imagine the following scenario:
[23:05:55] <__monty__> Well, yeah. Do you only want to work on software that is exclusively for use by developers? Because teaching lay people Git just to report a problem they have with some small utility doesn't sound very productive.
[23:06:06] <[exa]> lots of github repos are available over the internet, say through the plain http transport or something else, with people managing their own repositories and everything
[23:06:20] <[exa]> now, you have a repository, someone's got a clone of it, and wants to PR back
[23:06:28] <[exa]> how do you do that in a decentralized way?
[23:06:39] <tomsmeding> email?
[23:06:42] <__monty__> Email, kinda.
[23:06:52] <tomsmeding> not sure how serious this suggestion is
[23:07:05] <tomsmeding> like, it's how git began, it's decentralised _in principle_ but not in practice
[23:07:06] <[exa]> one way is to send an email (inb4: mailing list) but that's either unicast, or centralized again because someone needs to keep the ML address
[23:07:37] <tomsmeding> is one server per project still "centralised"?
[23:07:46] <tomsmeding> if you want to decentralise within a project, that sounds over the top to me
[23:07:56] <[exa]> not really, everyone can make their own server
[23:07:57] <tomsmeding> splitting up github != splitting up every project
[23:08:23] <__monty__> The transport is also not crucial. Any medium that allows for easy mixed text/binary messages would be workable.
[23:09:15] <tomsmeding> matrix? :p
[23:09:26] <[exa]> the middle-ground situation could be what's happening with the many gitlabs now, it's generally hard to send a PR across
[23:09:51] <[exa]> but the setup is viable (many servers, many repos per server)
[23:11:01] <[exa]> the other option would be the old-gnu way, 1:1 combination of software pieces and responsible maintainers with good spamfilters
[23:11:16] <[exa]> not sure that's good either

[23:16:49] <monochrom> My understanding of the technicality is that decentralization can be done like bit torrent does it. Hell, the bit torrent community has got even decentralized trackers to work.
[23:17:13] <[exa]> bittorrent decentralization is underrated
[23:17:33] <[exa]> I was thinking if we could just throw the PRs into DHT
[23:17:38] <monochrom> But my understanding of humans is that most people still prefer centralization, a central portal like github.
[23:18:03] <[exa]> the information piece that is shared there is basically "hey guys have a look I've got a patch that does $functionality in $software"
[23:18:31] <[exa]> most people don't want to solve trust and availability issues daily
[23:19:16] <[exa]> establishment of these is quite natural in communities since forever, I guess we won't change that overnight
