[00:15:38] <Robomot> Amazon Demands One More Thing From Some Vendors: a Piece of Their Company - WSJ (Certain suppliers are asked to give Amazon the right to buy shares at potentially lower-than-market rates as part of their contract. Some companies say it’s an offer they can’t refuse; Amazon says the deals are tied to it providing large amounts of business to the vendors.)
[00:15:40] <Logos01> What do you mean by 'distributed systems library' ?
[00:16:36] <Logos01> gwern: Walmart has been doing similar with their suppliers since as far back as I am able to recall the subject.
[00:16:46] <catern> Logos01: if you're interested in looking I can PM it to you, but first impressions on a draft are a non-renewable resource, so..
[00:16:53] <gwern> Logos01: really? they demand equity in their suppliers? I've never heard of that either
[00:17:15] <Logos01> gwern: Not the equity part, no, but they demand their suppliers sell their goods to Wal-Mart at below-market prices.
[00:17:32] <gwern> 'negotiating a discount' is entirely normal. negotiating warrants seems new
[00:18:05] <gwern> 'Corporate executives in a range of industries and lawyers said Amazon’s push to get warrants as part of vendor deals is highly unusual.

[00:18:15] <Logos01> gwern: It becomes a bit of a problem when it's tied to an exclusivity clause and frequently -- perhaps intentionally -- drives the suppliers out of business so as to prevent Wal-Mart from needing to honor their debts to said suppliers.

[00:18:58] * gwern wonders if this is  good or bad
[00:19:33] <Logos01> Amazon has been known to intentionally break APIs that successful third-party related-service vendors rely upon for whatever newfangled third-party extension of AWS they're selling, only to reimplement the service in-house.  
[00:19:53] <Logos01> The fact that they're now turning to demanding companies sell equity to Amazon at below-market prices instead of doing *that* is just ... well.
[00:20:28] <dbohdan> catern: I can give it a look
[00:20:30] <Logos01> It's not illegal, no, nor even strictly speaking "unethical" but it's got that scent of corporate-sociopathy about it as a business practice.

[00:35:38] <kuudes> yeah, that makes sense
[00:36:00] <ggreer> and the cops can confiscate your equipment and domains (as happened)
[00:36:36] <kuudes> indeed
[00:38:04] <ggreer> the other tricky thing about being wanted by the US is that you can't travel to any countries that do have stronger extradition agreements

[00:38:47] <ggreer> need no. want? yes
[00:38:49] <kuudes> and within eu extradition is tricky
[00:39:15] <kuudes> usa usually has too long sentences to be allowed extradition to
[00:39:43] <kuudes> many of us sentence lengths are considered a life imprisonment on this side of atlantic
[00:40:28] <kuudes> it was weird to learn usa had indeed extradited a couple of americans to japan re that nissan case
[00:40:52] <ggreer> well yeah. extradition is a two way street
[00:41:18] <ggreer> the US only gets extradition deals because it also sends americans to other countries for the crimes they committed there
[00:41:19] <kuudes> it seems to me that indeed the proper way is to do the sentencing in the country of residence
[00:41:42] <kuudes> that way you can at least know what law you are subjected to
[00:42:06] <kuudes> and in any case for extradition it is required that the crime is a crime in both ends
[00:42:18] <ggreer> so if you travel to the US and murder someone, then manage to get back to your home country where the penalty for murder is much less, that's fine?
[00:42:22] <kuudes> so it does not make much of sense to transmit the person, but maybe from cost side

[00:48:49] <kuudes> after they return home, usa has jurisdiction, and italy has to request us authorities to do stuff under us laws

[00:49:07] <gwern> (this form 990 sure is boring now that openai does everything under the LP for-profit subsidiary)

[00:56:24] <kuudes> there seemed to be no real law to prevent their trial in usa according to us laws - driving over a person and killing them is a crime there as well

[00:59:06] <kuudes> Logos01, well, usa specifically has said that it deems the crime to be under uk jurisdiction and that uk jurisdiction can't apply to foreign diplomats because of wien agreement
[00:59:29] <Logos01> kuudes: Well that's because diplomatic immunity status, I'm sure.
[00:59:40] <kuudes> yes, that is what they plea
[00:59:50] <kuudes> but diplomatic immunity applies only on the receiving country
[00:59:54] <Logos01> Which is separate; the FedGov has the *right* to try the diplomat's wife with murder already.
[01:00:05] <kuudes> ie uk waives jurisdiction on diplomats, they remain on jurisdiction of sending countries

[01:01:55] <kuudes> and if they didn't, then that indeed would open foreign illegally murdered people's families the option to sue cia agents on usa for murders
[01:02:02] <kuudes> which would be good and correct
[01:02:11] <Logos01> kuudes: I'm pretty sure diplomatic immunity precludes being named a defendant in a lawsuit.
[01:02:23] <kuudes> but diplomatic immunity does not apply against your own country
[01:02:27] <kuudes> only the receiving country
[01:02:29] <Logos01> So the family may have the right to sue but they can't sue someone with diplomatic immunity.
[01:02:47] <kuudes> if a diplomat from country X goes to country Y, indeed they are not under Y laws but X laws
[01:02:47] <Logos01> kuudes: Right but then the family would have to find a court in the US that would be willing to accept their case.
[01:02:54] <kuudes> wien agreement is very explicit on this
[01:03:06] <kuudes> yes, and that court is the target persons home county court
[01:03:23] <kuudes> and indeed they have jurisdiction on this
[01:03:33] <kuudes> but the home county seems to host many cia operatives
[01:03:39] <kuudes> and the law has been made muddled
[01:03:51] <kuudes> one would likely need to go to supreme court first on the jurisdiction issue
[01:04:48] <kuudes> but one can't plea to wien agreement on this, as mentioned - it is really clear that the protected persons are under the jurisdiction of the sending country, not receiving country, and are only immune against the receiving country, not sending country laws
[01:05:07] <Logos01> kuudes: The trick is whether or not there *IS* a home county court for an overseas diplomatic resident.
[01:05:18] <kuudes> there is
[01:05:22] <Logos01> I guess at worst you could try one of the federal district circuit courts. I don't know which one.
[01:05:27] <kuudes> usa specified what it is
[01:05:35] <Logos01> kuudes: Ahh.  Well then.
[01:05:41] <kuudes> because wien agreement makes this prerequisite for the immunity
[01:05:47] <kuudes> it does not allow lawlessness
[01:05:54] <kuudes> the protected persons need to be under *some* court
[01:06:13] <Logos01> Right but again that's about criminal not civil law.
[01:06:17] <kuudes> yes
[01:06:24] <kuudes> and that is the key issue
[01:06:25] <Logos01> And we're discussing civil law now.
[01:06:27] <Logos01> Yeah.
[01:06:27] <kuudes> no
[01:06:35] <kuudes> traffic killing is a crime in usa as well
[01:06:36] <Logos01> Well if you're suing someone that's civil law, so yes.
[01:06:45] <kuudes> can't you sue for a crime in usa?
[01:06:50] <Logos01> No.
[01:06:53] <kuudes> what
[01:07:12] <Logos01> You can sue for harm done to you as a result of the crime being committed, but you cannot sue for the crime itself.
[01:07:21] <kuudes> over here it is clear that you can sue for a crime if the public accuser does not sue, but only in that case
[01:07:41] <Logos01> Criminal and civil law are very separated.
[01:07:50] <kuudes> does the da have a duty to bring charges?
[01:07:54] <Logos01> No.
[01:08:02] <kuudes> wow
[01:08:04] <kuudes> ok then
[01:08:44] <Logos01> kuudes: You remember the OJ Simpson case?
[01:08:48] * kuudes updates to be more suspicious toward local americans as they might be under no laws
[01:09:26] <kuudes> didn't simpson get charged but was acquitted by a court?
[01:09:35] <nshepperd> most Americans you might meet aren't diplomats
[01:09:38] <Logos01> Yes, he was found not guilty of the crime of murder.
[01:09:46] <kuudes> indeed. that is all well then
[01:09:49] <kuudes> he was tried still
[01:10:02] <Logos01> kuudes: HOWEVER, he was later successfully fined for the wrongful death of his wife.
[01:10:05] <Logos01> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim
[01:10:06] <Robomot> Wrongful death claim - Wikipedia (Wrongful death is a claim against a person who can be held liable for a death.[1] The claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close relatives, as enumerated by statute. …)
[01:10:11] <kuudes> my question is on if one can force a trial for a person they accuse of a crime they have been a victim of
[01:10:19] <kuudes> yes yes
[01:10:20] <Logos01> No.
[01:10:26] <ggreer> yeah that's a civil case which is preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. also penalties can only be money, not jail time
[01:10:28] <Logos01> Criminal and civil law are very distinct.
[01:10:29] <kuudes> yeah, that sucks
[01:10:50] <kuudes> indeed over here you have the right to sue for a crime, and some crimes are only suable by the victim
[01:10:51] <ggreer> the whole jurisdiction thing breaks down with crimes that cross borders, and that's the case with most internet crime
[01:10:58] <kuudes> I agree ggreer
[01:11:07] <kuudes> the solution is to not allow internet if that is a problem
[01:11:23] <Logos01> ggreer: Well you can wind up having jail time from a civil case.
[01:11:24] <kuudes> or only allow internet with countries which you agree on laws enough
[01:11:32] <kuudes> this is similar with schengen
[01:11:32] <Logos01> But only in the form of being imprisoned due to defaulting.
[01:11:42] <kuudes> in schengen people can indeed easily flee abroad
[01:11:58] <kuudes> which is why you need to have the police and court cooperation and be in agreement-enough on crimes
[01:11:59] <Logos01> kuudes: So anyhow, the victim's family cannot go to the US and sue for murder.
[01:12:04] <Logos01> But they *CAN* sue for wrongful death.
[01:12:12] <Logos01> Because murder is a criminal charge, and wrongful death is not.
[01:12:23] <kuudes> well sure. but my point is not reparations but punishment
[01:12:36] <kuudes> ie the overdriver should be put into prison as per her own countys laws
[01:12:48] <kuudes> not as per uk laws, as per, was it houston's laws or where
[01:12:52] <kuudes> not houston

[01:20:58] <kuudes> the thing beside is that cia puts its operatives as diplomat spouses

[01:21:59] <kuudes> because indeed usa should be responsible to try its cia operatives under its own laws
[01:22:20] <kuudes> and I am in the understanding that us laws hold also murder abroad as criminal

[01:22:58] <Logos01> Could you point to that in there?
[01:23:16] <kuudes> the §31.4
[01:23:50] <nshepperd> that doesn't say that

[01:24:32] <Logos01> "The immunity of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving State does not exempt him from the jurisdiction of the sending State."
[01:24:42] <kuudes> but that is what the usa pleas
[01:24:56] <Logos01> kuudes: Because there's no local jurisdiction in the US in which the murder took place.
[01:24:59] <Logos01> Because it didn't.
[01:25:00] <kuudes> ie the county court finds that the person has diplomatic immunity and therefore the court does not have jurisdiction
[01:25:18] <kuudes> not that the murder is extraterritorial and therefore the court does not have jurisdiction
[01:25:18] <nshepperd> does it?
[01:25:21] <kuudes> yes
[01:25:24] <Logos01> There's no local municipality or county in the US in which the crime took place

[01:25:47] <Logos01> And there's nothing in the Vienna Convention I'm reading that mandates that a diplomat be under the jurisdiction of some local territorial court.
[01:26:20] <Logos01> That does not, however, mean that *extraterritorial* crimes the US FedGov has jurisdiction over would not still apply.
[01:26:34] <Logos01> But again we've already mentioned that for some reason the FedGov isn't willing to press charges for murder in this case.

[01:44:29] <kuudes> "National security lawyer Mark Zaid says the federal court in Virginia's Eastern district, where Judge Ellis presides, is the worst possible venue for those who are fighting the intelligence agencies: Ellis is "incredibly pro-CIA"."
[01:44:53] <kuudes> "But Sacoolas' occupation has been a bit mysterious.
[01:44:53] <kuudes> Her lawyer, John McGavin, said during a hearing last month that she worked for a US "intelligence agency", and that this had been "a factor" in her decision to leave the UK after the collision. "
[01:45:08] <kuudes> "Then, a moment later, he corrected himself, saying she worked for the US State Department. When the judge asked whether her job at the State Department was cover for her intelligence work, her lawyer said he did not have that information."

[01:48:45] <Logos01> The quirk here is the diplomatic immunity thing.
[01:49:55] <nshepperd> if the court where you live claims jurisdiction, diplomatic immunity doesn't matter
[01:50:00] <Logos01> That being said, as long as the immunified individual is legally a resident in some place in the US (the laws of residency depend heavily on state; many don't require you to actually live there, just own a residential property you own for the purposes of personally occupying) -- then you could totally sue them there for wrongful death.

[01:59:52] <Logos01> nshepperd: Short-form is that generally speaking states that try to impose "extraterritorial" laws have to do so by applying a workaround wherein some specific portion of the crime occurs within their territory.
[02:00:26] <Logos01> So for example for Georgia to make it illegal for women in Georgia to have abortions in other states, they would have to make it a crime to leave the state for the purposes of seeking to have an abortion.
[02:00:42] <Logos01> And could then use the act of having one elsewhere as evidence that when you left, you did so with that intent.
[02:01:18] <Logos01> What they could *NOT* do however is make the extra-state-territorial abortion *itself* be subject to that state's murder laws.
[02:03:00] <Logos01> nshepperd: That same doctrine is exactly how the FedGov criminalizes "pedo tourism"; the statute makes it a crime to travel to another country with the intent to have sex with a minor.

[02:23:17] <Logos01> Notice that the offenses have to be commited *in* a certain location.
[02:24:17] <kuudes> yes, she is a us national in us diplomatic mission
[02:24:31] <Logos01> Not at the time of the murder.
[02:24:32] <nshepperd> she was in the street

[02:24:42] <kuudes> she was a member of us mission to london or similar
[02:24:44] <Logos01> She was on a UK-owned and maintained public street.
[02:24:52] <kuudes> but uk had no jurisdiction on it
[02:24:59] <kuudes> because of vienna convention

[02:26:17] <Logos01> That's UK territory.
[02:26:28] <kuudes> it is territory where uk does not have jurisdiction at the moment she is driving on it

[02:26:35] <Logos01> No.
[02:26:37] <kuudes> yes
[02:26:43] <nshepperd> so section 9 does not apply
[02:26:49] <Logos01> kuudes: The UK *DOES* have jurisdiction.
[02:26:59] <kuudes> if it was the other way around, ie the uk person would have killed her, then uk would have had jurisdiction
[02:27:04] <Logos01> It's just diplomatically bound by law not to ever apply charges for any crimes committed there against her.
[02:27:08] <kuudes> now vienna convention says uk did not have jurisdiction
[02:27:14] <kuudes> so usa has, because no one else ahs
[02:27:16] <Logos01> No, the UK *DID* have jurisdiction.
[02:27:18] <kuudes> no

[02:27:29] <Logos01> No it doesn't.

[02:43:33] <Logos01> Which is literally the point.
[02:43:38] <feep> or rather, it doesn't even cede jurisdiction, it *immunizes* from jurisdiction
[02:43:47] <meowcat> ... we sovcit now?
[02:43:49] <feep> there is no conceivable interpretation of this verbiage in which this countermands the constitution.
[02:43:52] <Logos01> It's true that the supermajority of citizens were/are Christian.
[02:44:01] <Betawolf> He had the good grace to die quietly without spreading it, unlike the young whippersnappers of later millenia.
[02:44:17] <Logos01> But the religious makeup of the citizenry of a nation says nothing about the nation itself being related to or founded on principles affiliated with a religion.
[02:44:22] <Jayson_Virissimo> And that just is a sense in which it is a "Christian nation", so it shouldn't have said "in any sense".
[02:44:25] <feep> Logos01: here's an example, this was a semi-recent case
[02:44:36] <feep> the eu treaties say that the eucj is the highest legal authority
[02:44:42] <Logos01> The US has no state religion and its leadership has repeatedly and sustainedly rejected that affiliation as a matter of institutional practices.
[02:44:48] <nshepperd> as a Christian nation myself,
[02:44:55] <Logos01> feep: That's great for any ratifying treaty member.
[02:44:58] <Jayson_Virissimo> Logos01: you are confused about what the term "state" meant in the 18th century.
[02:45:04] <Logos01> No I'm not.
[02:45:11] <feep> right but the german cc explicitly contradicted that and said that it's formally impossible for the german state to agree to such a treaty because it was unconstitutional
[02:45:24] <meowcat> i ratified once. well, i was a ratifier. well, i had a rat and it was on fire. well, i set a rat on fire.
[02:45:27] <feep> or rather, inasmuch as it was unconstitutional.
[02:45:27] <Jayson_Virissimo> Read Hobbes and Locke to see what I mean.
[02:45:30] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: The US federal government is not a state in the terminological context of the 1700's.
[02:45:48] <Logos01> Which is literally why *THEY* called it the "united states" -- plural on 'states'.
[02:45:54] <feep> the point is, the eucj could not commit the german state to unconstitutional behavior by *any* means, *no matter what* treaty germany agreed to.
[02:46:13] <meowcat> i was plural once. well, i said i was plural once. well, we did. we said that i was plural once.
[02:46:16] <Logos01> This is inherently the point of contention in the federalist papers and what lead to the doctrinal claim by which the Confederacy seceded.
[02:46:20] <feep> in the extremely unlikely example that a diplomatic mission engaged in unconstitutional behavior, the same principle would apply.
[02:46:36] <Logos01> meowcat: I used to be plural. I still am, but I used to be, too.
[02:46:52] <feep> the vienna convention would simply not be considered in effect for the case.

[02:47:42] <feep> Logos01: the german commitment to the vienna convention is restricted by the basic law of germany.
[02:47:57] <Jayson_Virissimo> "The US has no state religion and its leadership has repeatedly and sustainedly rejected that affiliation as a matter of institutional practices." <- this is as obviously true as the statement "There is at least one sense in which the US, in the 18th century, was a Christian nation."

[02:54:41] <nshepperd> Betawolf: seems reasonable
[02:54:45] <feep> they are evaluated by the legal machinery of the participating states.
[02:54:53] <Betawolf> it's realpolitick all the way down
[02:54:57] <meowcat> i thought the english constitution was whatever chunk of legal precedent would cause people to drop their tea saucer if it got violated.
[02:55:08] <feep> in the case of germany, that legal machinery limits the effect of treatment terms, *no matter what* those terms say.
[02:55:38] <feep> treaty*
[02:55:47] <feep> in effect, treaties the german state agrees to are "sandboxed"
[02:55:56] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: The population of America in the US were mostly Christian, yes, but they were also the ones who with a supermajority ratified that no Church or religious institution would ever have supremacy in the state -- going so far as to have the 1st Congress *unanimously* ratify that the Muslims of Tripoli would find no religious enmity with America.
[02:56:15] <feep> ie. a treaty cannot gain root, even if the treaty says "I gain root"
[02:56:16] <Logos01> A supermajority of Christians who were against having a religiously-entangled nation.
[02:56:57] <feep> in the sense that, the german state is literally incapable of putting such a term into effect
[02:57:00] <Betawolf> I mean, we have historically just imported a new king because we didn't like the old one.
[02:57:01] <Jayson_Virissimo> Yep, which is fully compatible with the claim that that treaty contained a factual error (or more likely, deliberate exaggeration).

[03:03:43] <Jayson_Virissimo> That a treaty would contain an exaggerated claim in order to increase the chance of getting accepted doesn't imply I know more than Congress did at that time, only that taking liberties with the truth is a standard part of statecraft.

[03:04:21] <Jayson_Virissimo> I absolutely am not claiming they wanted a state church, or the government wasn't secular, etc...
[03:04:40] <Logos01> Because I see a few documents that show that Germany specifically made diplomatic immunity laws to comply with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.

[03:05:03] <Logos01> And it seems odd to me that this would be done and remain in good standing if it violated constitutional law there.

[03:05:40] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: Missing the forest for the trees.  The point is that even the "citizenry of a supermajority of Christians" isn't a valid claim for the US to have been a Christian Nation.
[03:05:46] <feep> Logos01: the point is, if the vienna convention required germany to behave in a way that violated the german constitution, ie. if a diplomat violated a basic right, something like dignity of man
[03:05:49] <Logos01> A Nation of Christians is different from a Christian Nation.
[03:05:50] <meowcat> i have been trying to watch the wrinkle in time movie in small increments for some time now, and my childhood keeps screaming.
[03:06:00] <nshepperd> lol
[03:06:04] <feep> in that regard, the convention would cease to apply
[03:06:05] <Logos01> And that distinction is one that *they themselves at the time in question* ratified as meaningful.
[03:06:08] <feep> hence the corpse-raping example
[03:06:14] <Logos01> Which is definitive in this conversation.
[03:06:52] <Logos01> feep: They wouldn't declare the person to have not committed a crime; they would just have no jurisdiction with which to charge the diplomat.
[03:07:03] <Logos01> Well, no jurisdictional *authority*.
[03:07:09] <feep> Logos01: they would, because they *couldn't relinquish* it.
[03:07:21] <Logos01> they couldn't relinquish it, correct.
[03:07:28] <Logos01> The diplomat would simply be immune to it.
[03:07:29] <feep> it is impossible for the german state to relinquish the authority to apply its constitution.
[03:07:37] <Logos01> Correct.
[03:07:46] <feep> no you are not getting this
[03:07:53] <feep> the immunity would not apply.
[03:07:54] <Logos01> That's why it's not "the receiving State shall be required to waive jurisdiction"
[03:08:15] <Logos01> But rather "the sent diplomatic agent shall be immune to the jurisdiction of the receiving state."
[03:08:28] <feep> the german state cannot *in any way* relinquish its authority and duty to enforce the constitution.
[03:08:35] <feep> (on its territory)
[03:08:39] <Logos01> The immunity can only be waived by the sending state.  Until waived, the diplomat is immune.
[03:08:51] <nshepperd> aiui all provisions in German law have an implicit "unless this conflicts with a lower numbered provision"
[03:08:55] <feep> Logos01: look, there's a rule ten or whatever that says the diplomat is immune
[03:09:00] <feep> the constitution is "rule zero".
[03:09:14] <meowcat> it sounds like you are describing a capability system!

[03:09:25] <Logos01> feep: Which provision in question is this?
[03:09:25] <nshepperd> so the immunity provision is "diplomats have immunity unless..."

[03:09:35] <feep> I can link case law
[03:09:38] <Logos01> Because ... yeah.  The immunity is not conditional.
[03:09:43] <feep> it is
[03:09:48] <feep> it is *inherently* conditional

[03:26:58] <gwern> 'Feedback? :: In https://www.gwern.net/MLP you mention "a Charles Stross parody, “Equoid”". This could mean either "an MLP parody of Charles Stross's stories" or "a parody of MLP by Charles Stross". In retrospect, I probably should've checked the author *before* reading the 33k word story. I kept expecting a plot twist like "Shub isn't actually evil and she's...

[03:28:04] <meowcat> ultimately someone will construct the polycule between eliezer and lauren faust and then it's all over

[03:28:16] <feep> Logos01: there was a case in 2011 where a saudi servant was mistreated

[03:29:58] <nshepperd> New stross. yeah i guess if you could resurrect old stross it might be good
[03:30:30] <Logos01> feep: Anyhoo. Short form here is that I do see that German law doesn't have any written provisions for *sovereign* immunity.
[03:30:50] <Logos01> But diplomatic immunity is definitely a part of their constitution and furthermore it creates constitutional rights to be compliant with it.
[03:31:11] <Logos01> Well, I should say "your" I guess.
[03:32:32] <Logos01> I would agree with your earlier objection about the rights being federal and not basic if it weren't for the fact that the paragraph did not in the second sentence indicate the rights created were federal, but in the first sentence *did* make the distinction of the law being federal.
[03:32:41] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/terraresa/status/1409990983987744773 1000 square miles of "if you fly here, we scrub the launch" seems reasonable? wtf

[03:33:00] <Logos01> And this hereby finishes my capacity to engage this or any rules-lawyering-ancillary topic for the day.
[03:33:03] <Logos01> Brainfried.
[03:33:10] <ggreer> I know at least 2 of spacex's launches this past year were scrubbed due to aircraft in the exclusion zone. it's easily cost them tens of millions of dollars
[03:33:47] <Logos01> feep: I want you to know that I am sitting in my house in 31*C temperatures.
[03:33:53] <Logos01> <_<
[03:34:35] <feep> Logos01: :(
[03:34:38] <feep> that sucks
[03:34:41] <feep> it's cooled down here
[03:34:50] <Logos01> Could take a shower with the water thermostat set to "H" and cool down in the process I swear.
[03:34:53] <feep> Logos01: anyway, the point is, I don't think this is settled law in germany
[03:35:07] <nshepperd> 1000 square miles is only a 18mi radius circle, doesn't seem like that much for a space rocket
[03:35:13] <feep> I don't know which way the constitutional court would go between basic rights and immunity.
[03:35:27] <feep> I'm sort of guessing basic rights, but hard to tell.
[03:36:08] <Logos01> feep: Except as stated above my shallow end of the gene pool reading seems to indicate that rights derived from international law *ARE* basic rights.
[03:36:17] <ggreer> nshepperd: the rocket is a mile in the sky before it gets a mile downrange
[03:36:20] <feep> Logos01: sorry, human rights*
[03:36:31] <gwern> would you put 18 miles at every altitude around a jet plane?
[03:36:32] <Logos01> feep: Which would be basic rights.
[03:36:35] <ggreer> step 1 is to get out of the thick atmosphere. step 2 is to turn downrange and get speed
[03:36:52] <feep> Logos01: right, and my point is the ordering is unclear.
[03:37:04] <feep> but I'm betting the constitutional court would weigh articles 1 and 2 over 25.
[03:37:07] <ggreer> I'm underestimating the area because I don't want to be hyperbolic
[03:37:18] <ggreer> I plugged it into google earth and it said around 1500 square miles
[03:37:45] <gwern> (how fast is the rocket even going by the time it's above commercial aviation altitudes, especially altitudes where the plausibly small ones might be intruding? since obviously no jumbo jet is going to be stupid enough to route into it)
[03:37:49] <ggreer> but I could have gotten the waypoints wrong so I rounded down just to be sure I was correct
[03:37:54] <feep> (article 2 is right to life and health)
[03:38:06] <ggreer> spacex's live streams have telemetry info of speed and altitude
[03:38:09] <feep> gwern: the worry would be turbulence or debris
[03:38:17] <kuudes> how far off course space vehicles have flown in past?
[03:38:31] <gwern> feep: and other planes can't have turbulence or debris?
[03:38:46] <feep> they can, and this can prevent takeoffs.
[03:38:52] <ggreer> https://i.redd.it/xaisqxao5ef01.png
[03:38:53] <Robomot> image/png (4922x2967; 2.3 MB)
[03:39:29] <kuudes> is there a scale somewhere, I don't see it?
[03:39:48] <ggreer> all flights are 30km up before they're 15km downrange
[03:40:21] <ggreer> the issue is that spacex has to scrub the launch if any aircraft is in the exclusion zone
[03:40:46] <Logos01> feep: Article 23 section 1.
[03:40:47] <ggreer> but the risk to the rocket is only if aircraft get *really* close to it
[03:41:12] <ggreer> so they could make a much smaller "scrub zone" while keeping the exclusion zone
[03:41:37] <ggreer> and simply say "if you're in the exclusion zone. spacex is not liable for any damage or injury. also you may be subject to ruinous fines"
[03:41:50] <feep> Logos01: right, which is interesting.
[03:41:51] <kuudes> is that 28 degrees latitudes?
[03:42:13] <feep> Logos01: in that as opposed to 25, this specifically *doesn't* commit germany to a particular treaty *automatically*.
[03:42:32] <ggreer> kuudes: yes
[03:42:33] <feep> or at least not as a matter of basic law.
[03:42:43] <kuudes> thanks'
[03:42:52] <feep> Logos01: which makes sense because article 23 significantly predates the european union.
[03:43:19] <feep> actually hang on, was this patched
[03:43:22] * feep looks at the history
[03:43:59] <Logos01> Yes it was.
[03:44:02] <Logos01> " To this end the Federation may transfer sovereign powers by a law with the consent of the Bundesrat. The establishment of the European Union, as well as changes in its treaty foundations and comparable regulations that amend or supplement this Basic Law or make such amendments or supplements possible, shall be subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article 79."
[03:44:12] <feep> ah, that makes sense.
[03:44:30] <feep> Logos01: I think the reasoning for the legal case was that the paragraph that was countermanded by that change was one of the basic 20
[03:44:41] <feep> and as such, the change was invalid
[03:44:52] <Logos01> Article 79 section 1.
[03:44:57] <feep> um, for context, the first 20 articles of the german constitution are immutable. yeah.
[03:45:01] <nshepperd> 79(3) btw says 'Amendments to this Basic Law affecting the division of the Federation into Länder, their participation in principle in the legislative process, or the principles laid down in Articles 1 and 20 shall be inadmissible.'
[03:45:43] <Logos01> Amusingly Article 79 section 3 *IS* mutable.
[03:45:46] <nshepperd> so it seems like article 1 would win there
[03:45:50] <Logos01> And that's what declares 1-20 to be immutable.
[03:45:55] <feep> it is
[03:46:00] <ggreer> rockets are maybe 4-5km downrange by the time they're 10km up (where jet aircraft cruise)
[03:46:07] <Logos01> Well at least Germans are well-organized.
[03:46:11] * Logos01 snerks
[03:46:12] <feep> however, an attempt to change it would borderline lead to a revolution.
[03:46:29] <ggreer> so it looks like their exclusion zones are 100x larger than needed, even if you give the launchpad some very big safety margins
[03:46:30] <feep> anyway, and then the constitutional court said the german parliament could not divest itself of its duty to enforce the legal system
[03:46:36] <Logos01> feep: And Germans, unlike Americans, have a right to overthrow their government.
[03:46:40] <feep> yep
[03:46:43] <kuudes> hmm, earth is about 10000 km per 90 degrees
[03:46:54] <kuudes> so 1 degree is 1000/9 = 111 km?
[03:47:05] <nshepperd> 100x larger than 4-5km is 400-500km
[03:47:11] <Logos01> feep: Right but the trick there is that the parliament cannot divest itself of the duty to enforce the legal system.
[03:47:57] <Logos01> And IIRC the article one talks about the judicial and executive branches being restricted by justice and the rule of law.
[03:48:16] <nshepperd> i suppose you mean 100x by area even though measuring this in area seems very silly

[03:48:36] <feep> Logos01: anyway, article 25 has been in there from the start.
[03:48:43] <feep> so this wouldn't apply to it.
[03:48:50] <Logos01> Sorry it's article 20.
[03:49:00] <nshepperd> but 10x of 4-5km is 40-50km, which is still larger than the exclusion zone
[03:49:02] <feep> no 25 is the international law one
[03:49:04] <Logos01> ' The legislature shall be bound by the constitutional order, the executive and the judiciary by law and justice.'
[03:49:15] <Logos01> feep: I'm making a different point here.
[03:49:26] <feep> amusingly, 27 establishes a german trade fleet
[03:49:38] <kuudes> so half a degree is 56 km
[03:50:06] <Logos01> feep: Do you have clarification on that "constitutional order" statement?
[03:50:29] <feep> Logos01: right, I'm just saying 25 wouldn't be modified by 79 because 25 was part of the original set
[03:50:36] <feep> Logos01: um, hang on
[03:50:53] <feep> Logos01: this term isn't any clearer in german
[03:51:42] <feep> Logos01: basically, it means "all of current standing law, in its prioritized order from the basic law down"
[03:52:11] <feep> ie. "the constitutional system", meaning not just the constitution but all lawful operations done under the constitution.
[03:52:15] <ggreer> nshepperd: measuring in area seems fine because it's area that planes fly in. if I'm painting parking spots and I make one 100x larger than necessary, that means 100 fewer cars can park in the lot
[03:52:17] <kuudes> hmm, but rocket speed is something like 100x plane speed, isn't it?
[03:52:33] <ggreer> doesn't matter if it's "only" 10x larger in each direction
[03:52:40] <meowcat> what the hell kind of parser does this law need??
[03:52:59] <nshepperd> it's distance from the launch site that determines whether something bad happens
[03:53:02] <feep> Logos01: hilariously, in a different paragraph this means a *different* term of law, the freiheitliche demokratische grundordnung
[03:53:03] <ggreer> kuudes: not at the start. rockets take time to get up to speed. usually by the time they're at 10km, they're supersonic
[03:53:20] <Logos01> feep: Yeah, I'm seeing that 'constitutional order' is a term that's often referred to but never actually clarified in any location.
[03:53:25] <meowcat> (how leftist a professor do you need to specify a parser that can parse this law? express in terms of noam chomsky.)
[03:53:26] <feep> ie. the {human dignity, democratic participation, state of law}
[03:53:26] <Logos01> But used by a lot of countries.
[03:53:49] <Logos01> Anyhoo.  
[03:54:00] <kuudes> I mean, airports have exclusion zones as well, sort of
[03:54:15] <kuudes> ie the drone that stopped flights in london etc
[03:54:16] <Logos01> feep: I'm not seeing much that dislodges my current understanding that diplomatic immunity would be included in the basic human rights protected under Article 1.
[03:54:28] <ggreer> in that case the drone was almost certainly in the flight path or very close
[03:54:39] <Logos01> Since Article 1 specifically declares that the human rights are "listed below"  and Article 25 specifies international law *creates* rights.
[03:54:58] <kuudes> diplomatic immunity is not a human right as far as I know
[03:55:04] <feep> Logos01: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhm
[03:55:04] <nshepperd> diplomatic immunity isn't a human right, don't be silly
[03:55:10] <Logos01> kuudes: It *seems* to be in Germany.
[03:55:18] <kuudes> sounds dubious
[03:55:28] <feep> Logos01: that's a stretch, but it's possible - in any case, that would just mean you'd run into a rights conflict
[03:55:34] <Logos01> kuudes: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html <-- article 25.
[03:55:36] <Robomot> Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany
[03:55:42] <feep> and I *still* think the cc would prioritize the article 2 rights.
[03:55:43] <nshepperd> it may or may not create a 'right' but that's not the same thing
[03:55:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I am reading https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,3877.msg0.html#new
[03:55:54] <kuudes> what would happen if the rocket partially exploded? is it impossible it would hit ocean or ground sooner than 10 km?
[03:55:54] <Robomot> Book Review: How Asia Works: ... (Book Review: How Asia Works: ...)
[03:56:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this part stood out
[03:56:04] <Logos01> feep: "The general rules of international law shall be an integral part of federal law. They shall take precedence over the laws and directly create rights and duties for the inhabitants of the federal territory.
[03:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Despite all these benefits, land reform rarely happens. Landlords naturally resist expropriation, and no country at this stage has the money to pay them market value. The Asian countries got their land reform through convoluted pathways. Japan's happened first in the Meiji Restoration, but didn't stick; the final version was rammed through by Douglas MacArthur, who acted as a dictator and didn't care what Japanese elites
[03:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus>  thought. China's happened under communism, and South Korea's and Taiwan's happened as part of an American-led effort to defuse the appeal of communism by giving peasants and workers an unusually fair deal under capitalism.
[03:56:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> The American efforts owe a lot to US diplomat Wolf Ladejinsky, one of the heroes of this book. He was a Russian immigrant to America whose experiences under communism gave him a better idea what peasants wanted than most of his colleagues, and he pushed for land reform when everyone else thought it sounded too communist. His work was crucial in East Asia, but the US establishment sidelined him before he could influence the

[03:57:03] <feep> Logos01: compare article 22, which specifies the colors of the federal flag :P
[03:57:08] <Logos01> feep: I dunno, the language seems pretty clear about rights deriving from international law.
[03:57:39] <feep> Logos01: I'm not saying the vienna convention doesn't create a right in german constitutional law
[03:57:46] <nshepperd> 'rights' is not 'human rights' or even 'basic rights'
[03:57:58] <feep> I'm saying it's a tradeoff
[03:58:06] <Logos01> This is a bit of a misdirection though since it *ALSO* says that international laws "shall take precedence over the laws"
[03:58:10] <feep> and I'm *guessing* the cc would hold the art 2 rights higer.
[03:58:19] <feep> higher*
[03:58:24] <kuudes> I am unsure if wien convention is part of international law

[03:58:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, lol @ this part - so the guy gets accused of being a Communist / having ties to the Soviets / etc., and:
[03:58:37] <Logos01> kuudes: article 23. 
[03:58:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The result was a public outcry. Members of the press repeatedly questioned President Eisenhower regarding the Ladejinsky case at a news conference held on January 12, 1955, particularly focusing on the fact that Ladejinsky was almost immediately chosen by Harold Stassen at the Foreign Operations Administration to direct the land reform program in South Vietnam, giving him full security clearance in order to fill a position
[03:58:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  even more sensitive than his previous one (Schrecker 1998:293; Back To Work 1955).
[03:58:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> One quoted Benson as having "branded Ladejinsky flatly as a member of two Communist front organizations, and as an economist analyst, and investigator for Amtorg, the Russian trading agency" (Woolley & Peters 2007b). John Allison, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, protested the firing. Author James Michener wrote a letter to the New York Times stating "It is precisely as if Richard Nixon and Adlai Stevenson were to be charged with

[04:06:43] <kuudes> iirc in finland they had most recent land defragmentation project within 10 or 20 years
[04:07:46] <kuudes> there was something that the landowners of most arable land were collected together and interviewed and then after long negotiations and discussions a common plan to trade lands between owners was agreed and signed per area or something
[04:07:53] <kuudes> but I don't know how to find a link to it
[04:08:24] <kuudes> because arable land gets fragmented over time when people sell parts of lots and rent them and buy them and people die and others inherit etc
[04:08:37] <kuudes> and larger lots are often better useful for actual land use

[04:12:34] <kuudes> one thing that has been nice is that the state land office has started to search and set up woodland lots to sell people for summer cottages
[04:13:16] <kuudes> as summer cottages sort of have been "larger than life" and people feel wronged when their siblings have got better inheritance or whatnot - so now that there are more lots for sale, one can use money to buy one
[04:14:11] <kuudes> ie equity in inheritance is enforced by state to level that half of the value of property must be divided equitably between the direct heirs (children), but half can be dedicated by will
[04:14:20] <gwern> (harberger taxes would fix that kind of stickiness and endowment effect)
[04:14:27] <kuudes> few people want to become farmers
[04:14:53] <kuudes> well, maybe
[04:15:12] <kuudes> I am unsure how harberger taxes would treat people worsening value of land on purpose
[04:15:24] <Betawolf> why not? You collect subsidies just for not doing anything with your land, sounds great.
[04:15:27] <kuudes> ie over here you can't just do whatever you want with your land
[04:15:29] <gwern> there is not much any system can do about sufficient spite
[04:15:41] <kuudes> ie destroying forest is criminal etc
[04:15:59] <kuudes> and that includes things like not caretaking forest with proper specified methods
[04:16:03] <gwern> what are you going to do? punish them? they are already punishing themselves
[04:16:11] <kuudes> prison
[04:16:30] <kuudes> upside is that finnish forest dry weight has increased by +50% since 70s
[04:16:43] <kuudes> scientific methods ftw
[04:16:54] <gwern> a spiteful person can easily be sufficiently stubborn that sending them to prison would provoke an outcry
[04:17:07] <kuudes> ?
[04:17:12] <gwern> no one wants their local HOA to be able to jail them for having roses the wrong shade of red
[04:17:28] <kuudes> yeah, we don't have those
[04:17:44] <kuudes> zoning is different matter and is done by cities
[04:17:59] <kuudes> agricultural and forestry stuff is done by state

[08:45:27] <meowcat> wait, is this why pornhub keeps trying to show me mormon porn?

[08:45:52] <meowcat> oh. so why do they want to tell me about their trust & safety?
[08:46:08] <quanticle> meowcat: What I find more surprising is that the people out at Bonneville Speed Week don't wear masks. Like, you have drag racing cars kicking up all sorts of dust, all day every day for a week, and people are just walking around like it's totally fine to be breathing that.
[08:46:18] <meowcat> ew.
[08:47:27] <Logos01> It helps to know that the "Public Health Crisis" announcement came out at roughly the same time that this was going around the news circuit: https://kutv.com/news/local/salt-lake-city-has-the-worst-air-quality-in-the-nation

[09:19:24] <meowcat> there's something different between "i want to use this symbol in public play" and "i want to just be here, and you are projecting a racist symbol onto my very body"
[09:20:05] <Logos01> Well.  I mean, part of what makes fetishism what it is, is the very "Tabooness" and "wrongness" of the thing.
[09:20:05] <meowcat> like, in the one case, any white/black couple just for being there are going to get shit, in the other case, someone actually has to put up a swastika or something, it's not just their skin tone
[09:21:30] <meowcat> sure, "this is a safe place to whack each other with leather, no matter what you look like" is not the same as "this is a safe place to yell racial slurs at each other in a way that suggests everyone else is into that" or whatever?
[09:21:44] <meowcat> but, not my dungeon, not my dragons
[09:22:00] <Logos01> meowcat: I just remember that 10 years ago you could show up in a playspace in an ambiguously Soviet/Nazi/Italian 'fascist/commandant' getup and people would just say, "That's hot".

[13:55:18] <rsaarelm> Though I guess people are likely to just go "past people were fucked up eh" instead of "neat how see the gears of the cathedral in action with the dissonance from the present-day ambient atmosphere, you really can set up a Respectable Explanation Machinery to prop up lots of conflicting value systems huh"
[13:55:19] <quanticle> lol
[13:56:17] <rsaarelm> I mean what's wrong with the present-day Respectable Explanation Machinery cathedral that it seems totally uninterested in vigorously teaching people about the second part, I don't get it.
[13:57:17] <quanticle> "Yet the old idea, assiduously propagated by homosexuals, that homosexuality is an inborn, incurable disease, has been exploded by modern psychiatry, in the opinion of many experts. It can be both prevented and cured, these experts say."
[13:58:58] <quanticle> Almost as offensive as the text is the number of commas they used. I too, like inserting, lots of, pauses in, my sentences.
[14:01:34] <quanticle> So yeah, the obvious thing to say here, "Haha, wow, did they really believe that," and it requires a contrarian level of #lesswrong or higher to read that and think, "What assurance do we have that we are right and they were wrong?"
[14:02:34] <quanticle> I guess that's the same thing as, "Watch the gears of the cathedral spin to create a new Respectable Explanation Machinery to prop up a new value system"
[14:05:06] <quanticle> Relatedly, I wonder how much of the success of the homosexual acceptance/gay marriage movement has been due to lesbians. Even in this New York Times piece, there is significantly less moral concern about lesbian than there is about gays.
[14:06:07] <quanticle> You make lebians the "face" of the movement (with e.g. Ellen Degeneres), and you're less threatening to mainstream culture than you would if you had a bunch of butch bears as your representatives.

[21:53:48] <gwern> dbohdan: so the problem with futa or furry or feet is that the fetishists are superhardcore and demand an ~infinite amount, but they still only get X% of their userbase being artists. so they need to buy away artists from other domains
[21:54:59] <gwern> and they can't substitute away. if you are a furry, what good is 'mainstream' stuff to you? it's basically useless. or a foot fetishist? why, most mainstream porn may not even show the actress's feet!

[21:57:29] <dbohdan> *Maybe it's that they
[21:58:26] <gwern> foot fetishists have always struck me as reasonably high-intensity in terms of maintaining wikis, curating collections of feet photos, paying for foot videos etc. it may be just that there's an inherent ceiling on it. what's the foot fetishist equivalent of a fursuit?
