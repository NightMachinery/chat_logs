[11:44:27] <easye> Mornin'  I can't seem to easily figure out how to run a git clone of org-mode-9.5 in emacs-27.2.  Adding the cloned org-mode directory in <file:~/.emacs> to load-path still seems to load the built-in org mode.
[11:45:20] <easye> Ah.  I think I am not adding the right value to load-path:  it needs to be the "lisp/" subdirectory not the main directory apparently...
[11:46:09] <intothewild> easye: yes. alternatively, you can run 'make install' and it will overwrite the org files in the emacs installation 
[11:46:43] <intothewild> but if you do git pull every couple of days and be cutting edge it's better to just point toward the folder
[11:49:46] <easye> intothewild: thanks.  I don't want to mess with the default emacs files, as they are "under control" of the package manager.
[11:50:27] <easye> I'm not looking to run development version, just the release version (and I couldn't get org-mode to install from ELPA for some reason)
[11:50:44] * easye still doesn't fully understand the package system wrt. which repo has what.
[11:51:22] <easye> But now I am running org-mode-9.5, so I am happy now.
[11:52:57] <intothewild> easye: great!
[11:53:38] <easye> Now I just need to figure out how to configure the babel mode shortcuts that are no longer the default, but my muscles remember...
[11:53:42] <intothewild> easye: you can compile emacs from source; it's not that hard

[22:45:24] <aindilis_> sachac: ty!
[22:47:30] <aindilis_> pkal: I've worked out some scheduling algorithms from a students' perspective.  I also have some PDDL temporal planning code that could probably import the constraints.
[22:47:31] <aindilis_> Another tool I'm going to check out soon is optaplanner.  If you're interested in collabing at all on scheduling, I'm pretty interested in general in AI planning and have a lot of prior work.
[22:48:58] <aindilis_> For PDDL planners, the two best for my purposes have been LPG-td-1.0 and OPTIC_CLP
