[00:00:24] <twomoon> or just keep faking it forever
[00:00:47] <beaky> yes python sends you running in circles between the website, the os package manager, and quasi-official third party python tools
[00:01:43] <beaky> you cant just use the os package manage it's out of date for real development so you go to the website but that version installs it system wide so you must use those quasi-official tools to create a python for every single project
[00:01:57] <bjs> party python tools are my favourite python tools
[00:02:02] <twomoon> what does the cargo solution of rust have to do with python?
[00:02:05] <beaky> what is party python 
[00:02:26] <bjs> beaky: not sure but three of them sounds awesome
[00:02:28] <beaky> the cargo approach solves it by having the one true official tool cargo
[00:02:37] <beaky> everyone uses cargo even the os which just works
[00:02:49] <twomoon> python doesn't do that?
[00:02:58] <beaky> no python makes you use pip and virtualenv
[00:03:05] <beaky> or venv (which i confuse with virtualenv)
[00:03:15] <twomoon> but pip and venv are basically one tool
[00:03:32] <twomoon> i have heard repeatedly how venv is the same as virtualenv but at the same time not quite
[00:03:36] <twomoon> it's weird how ppl explain it lol
[00:03:41] <jinsun> no you can use pip without touching venv at all
[00:04:03] <twomoon> ok so they're separate
[00:04:05] <bjs> twomoon: what happened was `cp virtualenv/ official_python_src/venv/`
[00:04:08] <beaky> they are separate tools but often used together to form and manage the python environments

[00:04:38] <twomoon> and then they updated the code after doing that?
[00:04:48] <beaky> yes they made it an official module so now both pip and venv are available by default
[00:04:48] <twomoon> so genetically speaking it diverged just due to updates?

[00:08:14] <RedNifre__> What's up with unicode and hearts? In the old days, "black" meant "filled in" and "white" meant "empty", but now the "black heart" turned into a black emoji heart? The "black heart suit" still renders like a filled out heart letter and actually white on black backgrounds, is this the new generic heart to use? ‚ô•
[00:08:30] <RedNifre__> Does ‚ô• look like a bland heart or like an emoji to you?
[00:08:37] <beaky> yes that looks like a filled out heart
[00:08:55] <node1> bjs, I just wanted to understand how git is stores the data under SHA-1. Using object type like blob, tree, commit and Annotated tag
[00:08:55] <webnet4> looks like three question marks
[00:09:06] <RedNifre__> It's three UTF-8 bytes.
[00:09:29] <erica> RedNifre__: Emoji is a completely different subset of Unicode. The problem started when vendors started rendering non-Emoji characters as Emoji.
[00:09:55] <bjs> node1: it stores things in a directory called .git/ . I'm not sure what you mean by "under SHA-1"
[00:10:03] <erica> "Black heart" is an emoji. "Black heart suit" is not an emoji, just a standard character.
[00:10:23] <RedNifre__> Yeah, but wasn't "black heart" not an emoji in the past, or am I missremembering it?
[00:10:23] <deniska> I've seen ¬Æ rendered as emoji somewhere >_<
[00:10:37] <webnet4> the commit hash is SHA1 + <somethign else i forget>
[00:10:38] <node1> bjs, I believe it stores under .git/objects
[00:10:59] <RedNifre__> Hm, looks like white heart suit is the non-filled one ‚ô° 
[00:11:03] <beaky> ncie i like objets
[00:11:20] <erica> RedNifre__: You may be thinking of the problem with "Heavy Black Heart" -- "Heavy Black Heart" is a standard non-emoji character, however, vendors started rendering it as a red Emoji heart.
[00:11:37] <jinsun> node1: you should read Chapter 10 of http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 if you want to want to know details of how git stores data

[00:13:08] <webnet4> oops that was TLS1.1 i was thinking of  SHA1+MD5
[00:13:12] <erica> RedNifre__: Doesn't here, but again, that's vendor-specific. ‚ô• is "Heart Suit" -- some places render it as Emoji, some just show the character.
[00:13:48] <node1> jinsun, thanks it was really informative.
[00:15:01] <RedNifre__> I'm looking for the character that means "You draw a heart with your writing tool and fill it out", as in if you used a fountain pen it would be a dark blue heart like the rest of the text and if you used chalk on a blackboard it would be a white heart. You would not reach for a different pen to draw the heart in a different color. Is there a Unicode code point that actually means exactly that?
[00:15:31] <node1> Also i think there should be no collision when we are using sha-1 
[00:15:49] <mawk> RedNifre__: ‚ô•
[00:15:51] <erica> RedNifre__: No, because vendors implement how text renders differently. In theory, that would indeed just be "Black Heart Suit" or "Heavy Black Heart", but vendors have chosen to implement custom renderings of those characters.

[01:13:17] <edgar-rft> poww0wmu11c: I personally think that neither Inf nor Nan are numbers, they were introduced in IEEE floats to make it possible to run long complex physics simulations without getting stopped every few minutes or hours by overflow errors. But I don't think that makes them being numbers. Some programming languages treat them as floats, other languages signal arithmetic errors with Inf or Nan.
[01:14:20] <pyzozord> poprocks: I learned pre-11 c++ (so '98 I guess?) when I was a kid, that was one of my first programming books. I didn't other point of reference so never went through "oh this seems powerful/messy" phase with c++

[01:16:33] <pyzozord> No I mean some of it's features are nice, but some are weird. For example I'm not so keen on operator overloading
[01:16:33] <Izem> what problem does it help solve? I could not tell you
[01:17:33] <pyzozord> poprocks: yeah that's also the thing I like about c, it's small enough that it's actually "grokable" even with all it's UB
[01:17:45] <Izem> yeah extensibility might be best left to other languages
[01:17:45] <poprocks> pyzozord: ah there you go, this is an example of what I was talking about above. operator overloading sounds really powerful to me. But I can see how it could get messy when using other people's code, if people do weird things with it and try to hide all of the underlying subroutines
[01:18:30] <Izem> it is really usefull, you won't have every algebra in your language
[01:18:59] <Izem> e.g. it would be easy/slick to implement PEG in c++
[01:19:06] <poprocks> and also, I'm coming at it from the perspective of, oh gee,this stuff is powerful. I could build something with this.

[02:37:11] <oldlaptop> "Elegance" in software has a fairly specific meaning, not much like "elegance" in other contexts.
[02:37:21] <phogg> pyzozord: sometimes they're the same thing
[02:37:31] <[itchyjunk]> Sounds like an elitist stance.
[02:37:45] <phogg> oldlaptop: I don't think I follow. How is it different for software?
[02:37:46] <oldlaptop> (a woolly, ill-defined, subjective meaning, but not the same meaning)
[02:37:54] <[itchyjunk]> I am sure different programmer have different idea about what software elegance is.
[02:37:57] <phogg> oldlaptop: it's pretty subjective everywhere
[02:38:02] <pyzozord> Dijkstra in that interview uses Oxfort Dicitionary definition for "elegant" - "ingenious and simple" or something like that
[02:38:17] <Izem> eh the music example isn't the greatest :P
[02:38:26] <[itchyjunk]> lol "ingenious"
[02:38:42] <[itchyjunk]> pretty pontified, then
[02:38:54] <phogg> simplicity isn't a hard requirement for elegance, sometimes it's elegant because it's complex

[02:41:30] <amigojapan> pyzozord: often in programming "simple"does not mean easy. More like "consice"
[02:41:37] <oldlaptop> I don't think the idea that it's a subjective term is seriously disputed.

[02:57:52] <[itchyjunk]> mathematicians take care to formally write out their work

[03:11:26] <piou> pyzozord: the very word you feel superfluous is there to give the precision you feel is lacking
[03:11:30] <pyzozord> my point is, without the word "recognizably" the sentence has _identical_ meaning

His secretary wasn't a programmer so there was no point in assuming familiarity with programming conventions. On the contrary producing documents has its own vocabulary etc that I think the secretary may have been familiar with. If that influenced the design of tex then
[03:23:24] <piou> it sounds like a good thing. And a famous mathematician whose secretary (probably not a mathematician by trade) fixed a mathematical error? It's pretty unexpected and the fact that he wasn't embarassed but instead felt like laughing publicly about his error and the skill of his secretary, that doesn't show arrogance.

[03:47:17] <Izem> well Histogram(file) is just an example, I don't know what the file object in java is 
[03:47:20] <[itchyjunk]> you missed a ,
[03:47:24] <[itchyjunk]> it's so dead, simple
[03:47:36] <Izem> you need the type as well, file is the var name
[03:47:37] <rty> no I'm serious
[03:47:55] <rty> after dense c++ it feels like a holiday
[03:47:56] <[itchyjunk]> well File file = new File("path");
[03:48:01] <[itchyjunk]> would make file a file object
[03:48:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[03:48:23] <[itchyjunk]> why would be the type of a file object ? lol
[03:48:30] <Izem> so the signature is Histogram(File foo)
[03:48:46] <Izem> ah yes, classic java
[03:48:51] <[itchyjunk]> hmm File is the class, so the type would be File too?
[03:48:56] <[itchyjunk]> oh that's what "signature" means
[03:49:05] <rty> you just cannot make a mistake in java, and if you do, it tells you
[03:49:06] <[itchyjunk]> was wondering why the tutorials keps saying signature
[03:49:20] <Izem> I need to make sure I don't do this in my language `File file = new File("path");` lol
[03:49:24] <[itchyjunk]> I've made mistakes it didn't tell me about! thought it was logical
[03:49:31] <[itchyjunk]> and i didn't make a mistake and it still told me about it!
[03:49:33] <beaky> rather than implement the file loading twice per constructor you can use the constructor that takes the file as a parameter and apply it in the default constructor to load the test file as an argument
[03:49:37] <[itchyjunk]> needeing to .close() something
[03:50:11] <Izem> then comes the question, do you really want to be loading files in a constructor? :P

[03:51:19] <[itchyjunk]> the more insecure, the better
[03:51:20] <beaky> yes instead of loading the file in the histogram, apply the Single Responsibility principle and construct the histogram from dataset values rather than have it perform file io
[03:51:48] <[itchyjunk]> hmm dataset value?
[03:51:59] <[itchyjunk]> so i make it take some standard thing
[03:52:01] <Izem> the file in question
[03:52:09] <[itchyjunk]> and i create a class that turns the file into this standard thing
[03:52:10] <[itchyjunk]> ?
[03:52:18] <Izem> yeah
[03:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> complex!
[03:52:26] <beaky> yes instead of doing the file opening and parsing and data cleaning you give it for example a List<> of all the data
[03:52:36] <beaky> yes exlat
[03:52:37] <beaky> y
[03:52:51] <Izem> then Histogram(DataSet)
[03:53:03] <PlanckWalk> A Java "File" is more like "file location"

Seems like a quite small amount of people are interested in technology and you find your self surrounded by corporate programmer that just are keen to get as much money and please their bosses. Even if it means dirty hacks, crappy languages and using moronic frameworks that should have been replaced ages ago.

[10:16:20] <droid3> Not i made a power method that does BigInteger^ BigInteger instead of BigInteger^int thats whats causing this issue :(
[10:17:47] <droid3> So you cannt raise a BigInteger to a BigInteger power for some reason. When the exponent BigInteger exceeds the integer capacity for the exponent
[10:18:41] <droid3> Hummmm anybody want to talk on this because multiplication , addition, subtraction , division and all the logical operation like and, xor , or ,...etc work fine with only physical hardware limits

[10:24:22] <deniska> droid3: well, maybe a library can estimate how much memory you (or 64 bit machine, really) may have
[10:24:59] <droid3> So that kind of seems not so good after all the BigMath stuff is for arbitrary big calulations not with any limits other then physical hardware/memory 
[10:25:13] <droid3> that the way i always understood the point of these libraries to be.
[10:26:08] <deniska> with power you get to memory limit *really* fast
[10:26:45] <droid3> So "java.lang.ArithmeticException: BigInteger would overflow supported range"  this is some sophisticated check that if the calculation started there's simple no space to compute it fully
[10:27:09] <deniska> before the exponent reaches values for which you even need bigint
[10:27:54] <jinsun> droid3: the built-in pow takes int only for the exponent it seems, https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigInteger.html#pow(int)

[10:29:57] <deniska> droid3: you need bigints to represent something bigger than 2**64

[10:44:32] <deniska> droid3: if you want to play around with big numbers, python doesn't check, it just goes until the next malloc() literally fails

[15:52:46] <pyzozord> merijn: ok got it, so "ware" is correct if we want to indicate a past hypothetical
[15:52:47] <mobidrop> pyzozord, sounds correct to me too
[15:53:52] <merijn> pyzozord: So both are grammatically correct (i.e. you could probably replace all cases of "if I were able" with "if I was able"), but they don't have the same "feel"

[15:55:10] <merijn> The same way that "Forgive me father, for I have sinned" and "I'm sorry daddy, I have been bad" mean the same thing, but also don't mean the same thing ;)

[15:57:32] <pyzozord> well I thought I cought Dijkstra making a grammatical mistake, that would give me a lot of satisfaction, alas he was right after all
[15:57:47] <merijn> pyzozord: The "were" also implies the speaker is sad/disappointed/whatever by their inability to do whatever is being talked about

[16:28:33] <pulse> yeah it's literally an iterator
[16:28:49] <thojanssens> pyzozord, yeah but as you said an iterator use case is to go through a list
[16:28:49] <pulse> but iterators can move backwards too
[16:29:12] <pyzozord> thojanssens: yeah but the list can be conceptual doesn't have to be a physical array
[16:29:28] <pyzozord> can be conceptual list of all positive integers, it would still be an iterator
[16:30:41] <thojanssens> pyzozord, say I create a module/class Iterator, it will be understood that it is some kind of util class to wrap a list (can be conceptual) and go through one's list.

[17:54:05] <arahael> Compare Java, Haskell, etc, with other VM's that are like Python or the like.
[17:54:16] <sjmulder> when parsing a binray format in C, what's the best data type for the buffer? void*? char*? uint8_t*? I find that char* gives sign trouble
[17:54:18] <oldlaptop> python, php, tcl, sqlite are all actually bytecode VMs (python is I think the only one that exposes that at anything like a user level, with all those .pyc files laying around)
[17:54:26] <GeDaMo> Java is usually JITted though

[17:55:35] <arahael> oldlaptop: Oh, it's not?
[17:55:36] <oldlaptop> or does it JIT a bytecode?
[17:56:00] <oldlaptop> the reason it's faster is that it has JITs for... I think amd64 and arm/arm64?
[17:56:23] <Teckla> sjmulder: It's implementation defined whether or not char is signed.  You can explicitly specify unsigned char.
[17:56:39] <Akronymus> >Python
[17:56:58] <oldlaptop> I'll admit I don't know offhand whether it has an intermediate bytecode stage - it's certainly possible for a bytecode VM to use a JIT after all, witness the common JVM implementation

[17:58:37] <Akronymus> How is the rider debugger/decompiler so good?
[17:58:43] <Teckla> sjmulder: uint8_t is a good choice, but I don't think it's guaranteed to be available.  char is alawys available, but it's not guaranteed to be 8 bits.
[17:58:49] <sjmulder> right Teckla and arahael, so I thought char* is a bad choice. between unsigned char* and uint8_t*, might as well go for the latter. but on the API interface, would it make sense to take a void*?
[17:58:56] <arahael> Teckla: I think it's specified by C99.
[17:59:06] <Teckla> arahael: Oh, I thought it was optional, interesting.
[17:59:19] <Akronymus> I thought the length of char was actually set to 8bits per some standard,
[17:59:25] <Akronymus> But int isn't fixed size.
[17:59:29] <sjmulder> Teckla, parsing this format requires 8 bit bytes, hence the explicit uint8_t makes sense
[17:59:31] <arahael> Akronymus: No, just has to be CHAR_BITS or something.
[17:59:42] <psydroid> alycidyne, that's interesting. I don't know much about Multics, but it was in the news a few days ago for a new release. I'm also wondering about the reasons why it failed. I've found some books about Multics that I want to read if/when I finally find the time.

[18:00:39] <sjmulder> Teckla, but most I/O APIs return either char* or void*, so does it make sense to take a void* and interally cast it to whatever makes sense? (uint8_t* in this case)

[18:24:08] <pulse> no, we're stuck with bad software because programming has been around for about 50 years and we haven't really figured out anything yet

[20:09:34] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[20:09:42] <[itchyjunk]> i know it's not storing it
[20:09:55] <not> u need to make the f.read assign to a variable and then check that variable for -1
[20:09:57] <[itchyjunk]> hence why i had c = (char) f.read();
[20:10:13] <GeDaMo> That's a different read from where you test for -1
[20:10:18] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[20:10:22] <GeDaMo> So you're reading two characters each loop
[20:10:23] <[itchyjunk]> let me change that around
[20:10:27] <not> GeDaMo: ye
[20:10:45] <jinsun> does Java not have something like StreamReader.ReadToEnd in C#?, this reading character by character seems too low level

[21:03:55] <[itchyjunk]> you need differentiability to get the structures neeeded for these spaces
[21:04:11] <[itchyjunk]> you learn classical differentaibility in elementary real analysis
[21:04:22] <[itchyjunk]> that's the easiest place to grasp that concept
[21:04:34] <[itchyjunk]> generalization of it is mostly dependent on what your goal is
[21:04:43] <pikapika> Ok. So the sequence of texts would be real analysis -> functional analyis -> topology/diff topology
[21:05:12] <[itchyjunk]> in a school setting , elementary real analysis would open up both functional analysis and topology at the same time
[21:05:26] <[itchyjunk]> you could learn topo without analysis , in theory
[21:05:38] <[itchyjunk]> what you gain from elementary real analysis is you learn about metric spaces
[21:05:48] <[itchyjunk]> which is an example of topological space
[21:05:49] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], I just wanted to know what are the criterion for spaces to possess to be able to do more than just simple algebraic things like addition or multiplication, ie be something where you could be able to do calculus, perhaps have a notion of "shapes" etc
[21:06:06] <[itchyjunk]> algebriac structures are "harder" criteria
[21:06:30] <[itchyjunk]> you often get these abstract structures and you wanna turn them into algebriac structure
[21:06:37] <pikapika> A ring imposes enough structure you can do calculus, "geometry" etc on the space?
[21:06:57] <pikapika> So like in theory a ring is only a multiplication but in practice most rings would be rich enough for these?
[21:07:03] <[itchyjunk]> not, not all rings have those additional structures. but you can do them in just rings 
[21:07:17] <[itchyjunk]> ring is a set with two binary operations
[21:07:40] <[itchyjunk]> i think you can do differentiability in polynomial rings for example
[21:08:01] <[itchyjunk]> if you add some structure to field you get vector spaces
[21:08:04] <pikapika> I mean, within a polynomial ring over say integers, yes
[21:08:06] <[itchyjunk]> if you do it with rings, you get modules
[21:08:16] <pikapika> The differentiations of the polynomials would also be inside the ring
[21:08:38] <pikapika> But what are the steps from there to having enough structure you can solve diff eqs over the set?
[21:09:14] <[itchyjunk]> you define what substraction of elements of those rings means
[21:09:17] <[itchyjunk]> and what division means
[21:09:41] <[itchyjunk]> so you get f(a) - f(b) / (a -b ) where a,b in your ring R
[21:09:58] <[itchyjunk]> that's all that was used to talk about differentiability in elementary real analysis right?
[21:10:05] <[itchyjunk]> you just need the same stuff in your rings
[21:10:05] <pikapika> Oh I see. Interesting. But the calculus definition would require taking it to the limit
[21:10:14] <pikapika> ie a-b should be possible to be made arbitrarily small
[21:10:15] <[itchyjunk]> if you can make sense of it in your ring, you have differentiability
[21:11:21] <[itchyjunk]> yes those are formalization because it makes sense in R
[21:11:37] <[itchyjunk]> you don't always need that. whatever makes sense in your ring
[21:11:47] <[itchyjunk]> "closeness" doesn't always mean metric distance
[21:12:13] <pikapika> So we just define "differentiation" within a ring as what we would do a secant in a R?
[21:13:01] <[itchyjunk]> well the idea is to study the change in output as you change the input
[21:13:10] <[itchyjunk]> how you encode that is dependent locally on where you are
[21:13:38] <pikapika> And how are distances encoded within a ring? Do you need to impose some metric condition onto the elements?

[21:18:29] <Quietwalker>  "Well, you have to understand, the testing will happen whether you schedule it or not. It'll either happen before go live, or it'll happen during it, but one way or another it'll get tested."

[21:19:22] <[itchyjunk]> what's the issue?
[21:19:29] <Quietwalker> uhm.
[21:19:47] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], thats quite interesting. Instead of trying to abstract away some "geometric" properties and continuities of reals, they instead define differentiation instead as any operation that would satisfy the product rule and chain rule
[21:19:57] <pikapika> Thats interesting and a clever way of abstracting the differentiation
[21:20:00] <Quietwalker> You can test for success, or test for failure.  Testing for success means you expect the tests to work and you have no plan to deal with things if your functions fail to work as expected.
[21:20:17] <[itchyjunk]> well, you get continuity in topological space
[21:20:21] <Quietwalker> If you test for success and everything works, you're fine.
[21:20:33] <[itchyjunk]> the result of tests seem irrelevent.
[21:20:35] <Quietwalker> if it fails, you've just wasted a lot of time, and also, your product doesn't work.

[21:21:02] <[itchyjunk]> so either way, testing is happening after shit goes live

[21:35:49] <usr123> Quietwalker: Yeah, but that's the part I enjoy, writing the code, and being in that flow. Writing each word myself and fluently.

[21:36:00] <usr123> Seems like that part is getting automated.
[21:36:57] <usr123> pulse: Yeah, but not sure what employers will think of that.
[21:37:15] <pulse> employers are not very smart when it comes to code
[21:37:20] <pulse> they want results, they could care less how you get there
[21:37:21] <bjs> usr123: if the part you enjoy is the writing of code then yes you should invest in using vim if that's the tool you enjoy writing code with
[21:37:24] <usr123> pyzozord: Do you see it decreasing?
[21:37:40] <pulse> btw vim isn't only useful for code, you can write anything with it

[21:37:51] <pulse> code just happens to be the common usecase
[21:38:05] <Quietwalker> usr123:  programming languages are just ways to get the computer to do what we want. Syntactical sugar is there to make code easier to read by people - the computer doesn't really care.  If we can optimize how we explain to the computer what we want it to do, then it doesn't matter what the name of a method is or if under the covers, it's doing something more complex.
[21:38:07] <pyzozord> usr123: employers generally don't care what code editor do you use. In some situations they might even force you to use specific one.
[21:38:16] <usr123> bjs: Yes, I enjoy editing text for some reason, when I watch people like bisqwit editing text really fluently. Which is why I try to get better at typing and vim.
[21:38:35] <bjs> usr123: then you should invest in it then
[21:39:25] <Quietwalker> usr123: so while in the short term, memorizing library methods and such might speed things up a little, it's probably not where you should be spending the most effort.  At some point in a programmer's career, they'll start looking at most languages as being more or less the same, just with different syntax to make some operations easier or not.
[21:40:02] <Quietwalker> the same could be said of anything the code ai would suggest ... if it's that common, perhaps you shouldn't be spending too much time on it.
[21:40:36] <Quietwalker> or you can treat it like system functions; it's already well implemented, unless you have a very specific need, it might be better to use a potentially well-optimized general case.
[21:40:45] <pyzozord> usr123: vim is a pretty safe investment, I don't see the situation changing much in 10 years. If anything there will be likely vim plugins that incorporate things like GitHub Autopilot
[21:41:53] <Quietwalker> as far as text editors go, I like ones that are project aware in some way, and have regular expression matching available.  Vi/vim works for the latter, but you need something else for the former. Some sort of more complex IDE.
[21:42:03] <Quietwalker> though I suppose you could always pick up emacs =D
[21:42:22] <usr123> Quietwalker: :D tried, my pinky hurts.
[21:43:59] <Quietwalker> I learned it on a dec alpha. I had to relearn it all over once I lost the meta and side-specific modifier keys (like, left-alt is different than right-alt)

[21:45:10] <usr123> pyzozord: Yeah, makes sense. I've heard someone's already working with nvim integration
[21:46:04] <bjs> usr123: In the end it doesn't matter if it takes over or not, you say you enjoy writing code as text using vim.  By "investing in vim" you really just mean "use vim to do the writing I'm going to do anyway" and that's just an obvious thing to do if you enjoy vim
[21:46:16] <Quietwalker> at least it wasn't a cosmonaut keyboard. They also have the super and hyper keys too, I guess so you can write APL natively or something.
