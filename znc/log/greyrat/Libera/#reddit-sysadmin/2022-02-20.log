[06:44:32] <Molnija> really, it's based on what the organization needs at that office, and it sounds like you only need a server there if the latency to HQ 3 hours away is too high,... or to have a backup main in case HQ gets bombed out
[06:45:51] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> yeah, the main thing I can think of is if they need DFS-R for file server caching

[10:44:51] <yuckey2d> cableninja - whats you take on cable managment for a home rack - I only have one or two network cables per box, but it kind of adds up 
[10:48:55] <Cl0udNinja> velcro straps and a label maker with plastic-y labels, labels wrapped flag style
[10:49:23] <Cl0udNinja> if theres dangle, get a cable manager deally bobber thing
[10:52:00] <yuckey2d> got a link to those plastic y labels?
[10:52:19] <Cl0udNinja> uhm... no... but I can probably find some
[10:53:17] <Cl0udNinja> https://www.walmart.com/ip/Dymo-Plastic-Labels-for-LetraTag-Label-Makers-Black-Print-on-White-Labels-1-2-Inch-x-23-Foot-Roll/882236
[10:53:21] <Cl0udNinja> one such example
[10:54:09] <Cl0udNinja> I prefer the plastic ones because the paper ones can get grubby if being handled a lot, and the adhesive tends to stick better to itself than the paper ones
[10:56:50] <Cl0udNinja> bonus if you remember type the label text twice with a few spaces in between, so that the flag shows the actual label on both sides, and the blank area from spacing is around the cable

[20:34:11] <riff-IRC> runtime calculations in generator software is always a fun thing
[20:34:35] <riff-IRC> fuel burned during a specific timeframe, scaled up
[20:35:12] <riff-IRC> and you need to know efficiency % to feed it into the equation
[20:35:48] <riff-IRC> usually took 5 minutes of runtime at a consistent load before you could get reliable fuel efficiency readings
