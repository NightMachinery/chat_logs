[00:23:12] <manicennui> I'm watching a YTer quiz other YTers about Japan, and I'm shocked by how little people know about car companies.
[00:23:25] <manicennui> He had a list of 4 companies and asked which one wasn't Japanese.
[00:23:39] <manicennui> Half of them picked Lexus because "it doesn't sound Japanese".
[00:24:31] <manicennui> The answer was Hyundai.
[00:28:45] <manicennui> 4 car companies.

[01:24:40] <gerikson> tbh Toyota chose "Lexus" precisely for that reason...
[01:31:12] <manicennui> I just assumed that everyone knew that Lexus was Toyota.
[01:32:08] <prussian> same
[01:32:15] <prussian> is this not the case?
[01:32:17] <prussian> mind blown
[01:32:18] <Brekkjern> Nope
[01:32:23] <manicennui> And these guys are famous YTers.
[01:32:31] <manicennui> Not like some rural rednecks.
[01:32:45] <Brekkjern> Lexus isn't very common here, so I would have to do process of elimination
[01:32:50] <manicennui> Brekkjern: There, sure.
[01:32:54] <manicennui> These are all Americans.
[01:32:57] <Brekkjern> Sure
[01:33:05] <manicennui> Well, a couple of them might be British.
[01:33:29] <Brekkjern> If you put me on the spot I might have forgotten that Hyundai is Korean though
[01:34:47] <manicennui> PewDiePie thought it was Nissan.
[01:35:05] <manicennui> He thought it was French, which makes a tiny bit of sense because of their relationship with Renault I guess.

[01:35:56] <gerikson> not a terrible guess because Nissan also has a faux-Euro upscale brand

[01:37:03] <bkero> Japanese cars couldn't ocmpete in the luxury sector with their existing brands in the US in the mid 90s
[01:37:08] <Brekkjern> gerikson: No idea. I don't really know the difference between those either :P
[01:37:26] <bkero> So they all (except Mazda) made new brands to sell luxury cars.
[01:37:30] <manicennui> The Korean companies have luxury brands now too.
[01:37:38] <gerikson> yeah
[01:37:43] <gerikson> but they're mostly US-only
[01:37:44] <bkero> Genesis is the same play.
[01:38:01] <gerikson> Lexus has a presence here but not much of one
[01:39:12] <Brekkjern> Bleh. The party I voted for isn't doing as well as I hoped.
[01:39:26] <Brekkjern> They are doing much better than last election, but I was hoping for a tiny bit more
[01:39:39] <gerikson> dang fellow citizens!
[01:39:44] <Brekkjern> Heh
[01:40:04] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I assume the party much more closely represents your views than our choices here in the US.
[01:40:41] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Well, kinda.
[01:41:17] <Brekkjern> I mean, more parties are viable due to the parliamentary structure, but you are never going to find a party that represents you "perfectly"
[01:41:26] <manicennui> Sure.
[01:41:42] * manicennui wants a proportional parliamentary system. 
[01:41:47] <manicennui> We'll never get it here.
[01:41:50] <Brekkjern> Heh
[01:41:56] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:42:09] <manicennui> Americans are too dumb and attached to things for no good reason.
[01:43:31] <manicennui> I think we'd have 4-5 main parties if we had a proportional system.

[01:45:06] <Brekkjern> A party with communism in their party plan has currently gotten 4.6% of the votes this election
[01:45:17] <Brekkjern> This is the election directorate

[01:45:24] <Brekkjern> They don't want to influence shit :P

[01:48:12] <buttsbot> Valgresultat for Norge – Valg 2021 – NRK
[01:48:45] <gerikson> ok you've got 4% cutoff too
[01:48:49] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:49:23] <Brekkjern> But you still get representatives if you are under the cuttoff. You just won't get "utjevningsmandater"
[01:49:51] <gerikson> ah!
[01:50:34] <Brekkjern> The votes are counted per fylke and you get representatives based on your percentage of votes in the fylke and how many representatives that fylke has
[01:50:49] <Brekkjern> (I can't remember what fylke is in English. County?)
[01:52:40] <Brekkjern> If you get more than 4% of the votes nationwide, you get "utjevningsmandater" which is there to give additional representatives. The reasoning behind that is that you can be midly popular across the entire country, but not win any direct representatives from any fylke. Those extra representatives are there to represent all the people who didn't necessarily get any local representatives.
[01:53:27] <Brekkjern> I have great Schadenfreüde that KRF is coming under that limit.
[01:55:03] <gerikson> heh
[01:55:15] <gerikson> ok that sounds a bit like our system too
[01:55:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I believe they are very similar

[01:57:17] <Brekkjern> I'm hoping the party I voted for gets past that limit. They were polling really well before the election, and they are still close.

[02:03:05] <Brekkjern> Myep. Doesn't look like MDG is going to get past 4%. Nearly all the votes are tallied, and they were likely much more popular in the advanced ballots.
[02:05:50] <gerikson> how come Pasientfokus is getting a seat?
[02:06:01] <gerikson> with 0.2%??
[02:06:44] <Brekkjern> I bet they got a lot of votes in a few districts
[02:06:49] <Brekkjern> And not much in any other
[02:10:30] <Brekkjern> It's kinda nuts that Demokratene has gotten an additional 1% since last election :S

[16:58:05] <edk> i'm not going to say this because lobsters people will just say it's needlessly alarmist and unlikely but at some point adtech is going to start overtly placing dollar values on individual people

[17:03:44] <riv> T_T
[17:03:46] <prussian> edk: ya.
[17:03:52] <prussian> it's a real fine line though.
[17:04:03] <riv> i wonder what like
[17:04:08] <prussian> I don't know what a good compromise is, but there needs to be some experimentation, laws written, etc.
[17:04:17] <riv> this whole thing about tracking seems very hypothetical and vague to me
[17:04:23] <riv> what really happens and how does it affect people
[17:04:35] <riv> i know that e.g. NSA logs masses of communications and just stores them forever
[17:04:44] <riv> and this doesn't really impact anybody except hard drive manufactoring
[17:05:02] <edk> until they get breached
[17:05:28] <prussian> I doubt they really just slurp it all up
[17:05:36] <prussian> I mean, imagine the datalake of that.
[17:05:43] <prussian> I legitimately cannot fathom.
[17:05:49] <edk> they have some very big storage facilities
[17:06:04] <prussian> they have to be pretty selective though.
[17:06:15] <edk> i think their model is to slurp it all up and store it (but i don't know how long) so that when they get specific leads they can cross-reference them with communication that happened in the past
[17:06:52] <riv> yes they are selective
[17:06:56] <riv> "select all" :P
[17:07:21] <cb> the problem is the NSA will never tell us if this dragnet surveillance actually helped them or how
[17:07:34] <cb> they have parallel construction et al for that
[17:07:50] <prussian> I can't imagine it is that useful honestly
[17:07:59] <edk> i'm sure it has been useful at least once
[17:08:04] <edk> i still don't think they should do it
[17:08:20] <prussian> but i guess if someone says something on a hypothetical IRC channel and one of the bots was not TLS connected and the NSA snooped it...
[17:08:43] <prussian> I can understand the argument for why they need to do it.
[17:08:49] <prussian> but yes, in my gut I know it is wrong.
[17:09:34] <prussian> Oh, this "I Don't Care About Cookies" post.
[17:09:56] <Brekkjern> NSA is an intelligence agency, and I don't think people actually know what "intelligence" means in that context...
[17:09:58] <riv> yeah this is actually why doing TOFU TLS on all connections is good
[17:10:07] <prussian> is that what we're talking about? I just want like a proper GUI and ACL system to allow/deny cookies.
[17:10:07] <riv> it's ""not secure"" so we never dod it
[17:10:11] <prussian> idk why this is so hard.
[17:10:21] <prussian> and "cookie jar isolation"
[17:10:26] <prussian> but that's me.
[17:10:35] <riv> but it increases the cost of global adversary doing surveillance from passive to active
[17:10:36] <prussian> it's *too* hard for the user I guess.
[17:11:07] <prussian> trust on first use would be problematic with a global evil spy net no?
[17:11:13] <prussian> hmm
[17:11:23] <prussian> I think I see what you're saying
[17:11:33] <riv> yeah you don't have a guarantee of confidentiality
[17:11:35] <prussian> doesn't PFS also force active snooping as well?
[17:11:37] <riv> but it still makes life harder for bad guys
[17:11:41] <prussian> thus eTLS?
[17:11:55] <riv> yeah pfs is great
[17:12:10] <riv> even if old keys get cracked new messages can't be decrypted with them
[17:12:11] <prussian> I tend to agree though. I like TOFU, but can feel the laziness evil potential in it.
[17:12:27] <prussian> I know so many people who just blindly type "yes" in ssh when connect to random machines.
[17:12:46] <prussian> and here I am googling "Bitbucket's ssh host key fingerprint"
[17:12:47] <riv> hehe
[17:13:26] <riv> I think the really awful thing is that people get paid for all this tracking crap
[17:13:34] <riv> and I bet it gives 0 ROI
[17:13:53] <riv> although you can ask if money was the goal
[17:14:03] <prussian> oh. ya.
[17:14:15] <prussian> people get paid for all the demonic hellfire people inflict on each other.
[17:14:18] <prussian> it's amazing honestly
[17:14:49] <prussian> Ya. I kind of wonder what they do with all this junk
[17:15:06] <prussian> oh well.
[17:15:12] <prussian> money talks.
[17:15:46] <riv> the problem with advertising is there's no way to really correlate it with sales
[17:16:15] <riv> so there's now way to prove that all this data collection stuff helps, or doesn't help
[17:16:38] <prussian> ya
[17:16:48] <prussian> there are a lot of holes with a lot of the metrics collecting.
[17:17:08] <prussian> not doing it obviously doesn't work.
[17:17:13] <prussian> but idk.
[17:19:45] <prussian> I wish the Kinesis macros didn't act so wonky.
[17:19:56] <prussian> I need to build my own keyboard controller, huh?
[17:21:13] <riv> qmk is meant to be good
[17:21:18] <riv> and hackable
[17:21:29] <riv> what Kinesis is it?
[17:21:55] <prussian> advantage 2
[17:22:21] <riv> oh wow, good taste !
[17:22:35] <riv> i have got a kinesis freestyle 2
[17:22:40] <prussian> looks like someone made a pcb for a custom controller
[17:22:49] <prussian> free as a bird now?
[17:22:56] <riv> not quite
[17:23:03] <prussian> I was thinking about buying a moonlander or making my own.
[17:23:07] <riv> the wire connecting the two parts is a little shorter than i'd like
[17:23:13] <riv> yeah i really want to build my own too
[17:23:19] <prussian> I mostly bought this out of laziness + my wrists were hurting using my K120
[17:23:19] <riv> just a bit expensive
[17:23:22] <prussian> lol
[17:23:31] <prussian> the woes of premade...
[17:24:18] <prussian> but ya, the separation on the adv2 is slightly too short for me, but it isn't a big deal.
[17:24:30] <prussian> short wire, smh.
[17:25:46] <riv> i didnt get a kbd thats literally 2 separate parts so they could be within 15cm of each other :D
[17:25:54] <riv> i still like it though
[17:26:09] <prussian> ya, wondering if I should have, but the prebuilts just seemed... untrustworthy. idk
[17:26:13] <prussian> that's good.
[17:26:39] <prussian> I have a friend who could print me a dactyl shell.
[17:26:41] <prussian> hmm
[17:27:00] <riv> oh is that done without a pcd?
[17:27:02] <riv> pcb
[17:27:06] <riv> its like wired up
[17:29:59] <prussian> ya
[17:30:11] <prussian> he has one, he made one for another friend of mine as well.
[17:30:14] <prussian> I was just too lazy
[17:30:25] <prussian> and wanted my *thing* now
[17:30:31] <prussian> as a good american comsumer.
[17:30:45] <prussian> idk. we'll see.
[17:30:56] <prussian> the adv2 is good enough as far as I know though.
[17:31:14] <prussian> macros are still "racey" though. If I type them too fast they sort of come out weird.
[17:31:17] <prussian> ->->-<->->->->->
[17:31:23] <prussian> that < shouldn't be there lol.

[18:30:11] <cb> i like that gnome seems to try ahrder than most

[19:39:45] <buttsbot> Twitter - mehdirhasan - On primetime cable tonight, Tucker Carlson discussed Nicki Minaj’s vaccinated cousin’s swollen testicles live on air.  We live in the worst timeline.
[19:40:09] <prussian> epic.
[19:40:16] <prussian> Tucker truly is the everyman.
[19:41:24] <manicennui> I wonder how his swollen balls are.
[19:41:30] <manicennui> Since he is vaccinated.
[19:41:36] <prussian> rip...
[19:42:03] <prussian> manicennui: you know, this doesn't surprise me though. I know of at least one nut who is all rabid about vaxx this and that and he got vaxxed too.
[19:42:07] <manicennui> Spending too much time on reddit has me believing that Republicans are dying from covid left and right now.
[19:42:10] <Xe> prussian: ?
[19:42:30] <prussian> Xe: it just seemed like you were saying the same thing multiple times.
[19:42:32] <prussian> lol
[19:42:46] <Brekkjern> Huh. I just saw an oddly accurate description of Norwegian political parties on Reddit:
[19:42:46] <Brekkjern> >You have, going from left to right:
[19:42:46] <Brekkjern> >Social democratic but pretends to be tankie, social democratic but 1960’s style, social democratic but center left, social democratic but farmers, social democratic but gay, social democratic but Christian, social democratic but lower taxes, and finally social democratic but racist.
[19:42:53] <Brekkjern> And the follow up:
[19:42:53] <Brekkjern> >You forgot social democratic but greenpeace, and social democratic but just really wants a hospital
[19:43:56] <manicennui> Recent learnings about hentai: there are only two body types in hentai: underaged and ridiculous boobs.
[19:44:42] <Brekkjern> To be fair, there are gradients to "ridiculous boobs"
[19:44:51] <Xe> yeah
[19:45:05] <cb> i hear "mommy milkers" is a common phrase"
[19:45:20] <Brekkjern> cb: That is just a universal phrase
[19:45:33] <cb> Brekkjern: https://i.imgur.com/C2FVuNZ.png
[19:45:35] <Xe> generally you can use the character's face as a milestone for boob size
[19:45:45] <manicennui> https://i.imgur.com/AFMXEOF.jpg
[19:45:52] <manicennui> I like that a lot, but the floor looks dirty.

[23:43:20] <manicennui> Recall should not be an option because you didn't like the outcome of the election.

[23:43:38] <gwozniak> Yup. That's fucked up.
[23:44:01] <gwozniak> And what's worse it that you don't need much to actually recall someone, as I understand it
[23:44:17] <manicennui> As far as I can tell, the main "issue" is that people don't want to take covid precautions.
