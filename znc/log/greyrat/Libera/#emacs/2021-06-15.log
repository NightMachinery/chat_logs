[02:14:35] <rdrg109> Mmhhh. Last time I was taking a course on discrete mathematics and we were reviewing counting problems. I found motivation by using counting to write a Python code block in Org Babel that given a key would create "bind" commands in my mpv configuration with several magnitudes by listing all the possible combinations of "Ctrl", "Shift" and "Alt" keys.

[04:33:29] <muto> I prefer single-window emacs programs, as opposed to multi-frame stuff like mpc and newsticker
[04:33:30] <henninb> i will give that a try.
[04:34:34] <henninb> is it common to use the eww browser? unfotunately I find it difficult to render pages with complex JS.

[04:36:25] <muto> Setting the shr variables helps make it prettier
[04:36:54] <henninb> ohh i was not aware of that. I will look that up.
[04:38:19] <henninb> that is a really good tip, thanks muto.
[04:38:28] <muto> Definitely!
[04:39:01] <muto> It's mentioned on the 'eww' section of the emacswiki
[04:39:48] <muto> The 'shr-width' variable is good for super-wide monitors, cause it limits the text width. kinda handy

[04:39:49] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: correct
[04:40:23] <henninb> looks like there are a few shr settings I should look at.
[04:41:43] <muto> yeyeye, 'M-x customize-group RET shr' has some handy variables in it.

[06:30:21] <twb> cjb: EMMS is... not great
[06:31:02] <twb> cjb: back when I ran it I had a separate batch job to populate EMMS's internal cache.  By default it tries to scan your music directory every time, which blocks emacs for like an hour
[06:31:09] <twb> cjb: at least, it did
[06:31:29] <cjb> twb: agreed, but it's the only music player in emacs that makes sense that I can find.

[07:23:54] <twb> I saw something about DNS but I didn't see the question
[07:24:11] <twb> 08:37 <bremner> can someone explain how secondary nameservers work? or point me to an explanation? I understand the NS records have to be domains, but how do the secondary ones get resolved to IPs?
[07:24:17] *** Quits: chika (~chika@user/chika) (Quit: Quitting.)
[07:24:23] <aidalgol> yep, that's the one
[07:25:10] <twb> bremner: basically you need at least 2 physical servers providing a DNS record, for redundancy.  When each server had exactly 1 name and 1 IP address, the secondary would be another server.
[07:25:28] <twb> These days you probably have a fancy anycast network as "the" server so it's kinda moot
[07:25:55] <twb> You'll typicall see something like example.com NS dns1.dns-provider.com NS dns2.dns-provider.com

[10:43:52] <dminuoso> Why would font-lock-mode (sometimes) cause incredibly slow scrolling speed in terminals? I can easily see the lines being drawn one by one..
[10:44:20] <dminuoso> (Im not 100% convinced its font-lock-mode, but disabling makes paging up/down fast again)
[10:45:32] <dminuoso> Oh ha.. Im beginning to suspect its either undo-tree-mode, or something related to garbage collecting. I just disabled undo-tree-mode, which triggered a GC, and suddenly everything is smooth again

[10:47:48] <stm> If you think it' related to garbage collection, you can check the variables `gcs-done' and `gc-elapsed' before and after scrolling a couple of lines. If the diffs are huge, it's garbage collection.

[16:11:59] <wasamasa> the flipflop thing is pretty short and includes a visualization what is going on

[19:10:43] <yates_work> Wolfe: can org-tree-slide produce pdf output?
[19:10:57] <grym> yates_work: yeah, it just stuffs it through latex and emits a pdf
[19:11:09] <Wolfe> Well. Org tree slide just steps through an org doc inside emacs. You could use any other exporter to produce a pdf if you want

[19:31:31] <yates_work> DSL?

[19:31:33] <rpav> so that's possibly one and unclear size/etc
[19:32:07] <Wolfe> There's plenty of companies that use it prod. If you regularly check r/haskell there's often haskell job postings there. 
[19:32:17] <yates_work> my how things have changed since the days of assembly and C...

[19:34:40] <Wolfe> Basically lets you define language rules 
[19:35:34] <yates_work> what are language rules?
[19:35:37] <rpav> their info page on the Sigma stuff seems pretty niche, but, sure 
[19:35:38] <hexo> i like haskell (also) because some problems solutions tend to be extremely small

[19:36:22] <Wolfe> People steer clear of haskell because they think it's complicated. Less people using the language means less production systems are going to be implemented using it. 
[19:36:38] <clockworkfrogs> The biggest problem with Haskell imo is the tooling, it can be really unpleasant to get simple things done 
[19:36:41] <Wolfe> This doesn't have any impact on how capable haskell is at being run at scale 
[19:36:47] <rpav> i steer clear because the compile times are horrific and it doesn't seem to solve any problems i have heh
[19:36:49] *** Joins: slowButPresent (~slowButPr@user/slowbutpresent)
[19:37:02] <Wolfe> It solves every problem you have. You just don't feel like solving them in haskell. 
[19:37:18] <rpav> so does a turing machine; and so i also don't
[19:37:26] <clockworkfrogs> Compiles are better than Rust at least :D
[19:37:37] <Wolfe> Haskell can solve it in a practicle way. You're just not inclined to do so. 
[19:37:38] <hexo> yea, wrapping your head around some haskell solutions can be really overwhelming
[19:37:54] <Wolfe> Anything I write in haskell I could probably write in C# or Java
[19:38:10] <Wolfe> I just prefer using haskell because the developer experience is sooo much better. 
[19:38:13] <rpav> c# or java aren't really contenders heh
[19:38:15] <yates_work> Wolfe: are you saying Haskell is a DSL?
[19:38:15] <stm> And many companies tend to stay on the safer side. If a project fails using Java, it is never the fault of the programming language.

[19:38:55] <Wolfe> rpav Contenders for what? Being run at scale in production?

[22:10:23] <dale> fannagoganna: You could try setting debug-on-quit, then when you hit C-g you'll be dropped into the debugger so you can see what you just interrupted.  That might give you some hints as to how to stop whatever is causing that.
[22:11:15] <YoungPotato> Hi all! I found a snippet on github to extend keepass-mode functionality. You can see it here: http://paste.debian.net/1201341 (or the full code here: https://github.com/Gleek/emacs.d/blob/5d8872c4e2a0ddad8685734f5c3343d1a1df54b3/core/core-tools.el#L315-L360).

[22:11:15] <YoungPotato> seems to be linked to "u"). Does anyone of you know how I can get to copy the username to the clipboard?
