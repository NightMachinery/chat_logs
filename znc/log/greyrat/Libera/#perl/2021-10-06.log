[00:33:09] <gordonfish> Good flippin grief. $client has an IIS server that uses some csharp programs in scheduled tasks, and it had a batchfile wrapper so it could map and use a network drive when it fired.
[00:33:13] <gordonfish> It recently needed to be changed to accept a command line arg, so in the batch file I added $* to the end (when I should have added %*) and instead of a simple "unknown arg" or whatever message, it just chokes hard with "Unhandled Exception: System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid DateTime" and a back trace.
[00:33:47] <mst> remember that every single windows thing has to parse its own command line
[00:33:51] <gordonfish> And I've seen this trend quite a bit when looking at old .Net based code on servers. Why is it so hard to do properly argv handling for these people?
[00:33:54] <mst> so much hilarity invariably ensues
[00:34:11] <mst> "windows is not really designed for argv handling to be sane"
[00:34:12] <gordonfish> Right, but it still feels really lazy
[00:34:36] <mst> honestly, a lot of the time I end up throwing a chair and then switching it to using environment variables to pass the information

[00:41:42] <gordonfish> Then again there's bugs still present in Windows, Office, etc MS software that's been around as far back as the Window 9x era.
[00:43:23] <gordonfish> s/there's/there're/
[00:44:14] <zgu> goes back even before that. they've been mistaking an escape character for a path separator for about 40 years now
[00:44:15] <gordonfish> ("There're" is valid contraction, isn't it?)
[00:44:27] <mst> most of which are probably hard dependencies for some customers by now
[00:44:38] <zgu> it's grammatically valid, sure
[00:45:02] <mst> "There're" is something I wouldn't be surprised to find myself typing
[00:45:31] <gordonfish> zgu: And DOS was based on CP/M iirc, but they had to change the separator..
[00:46:11] <gordonfish> mst: It should be short for there and are but it sounds weird to say aloud
[00:46:47] <mst> the way my accent works if I'm talking quickly the difference is not really noticeable

[07:07:11] <Grinnz> yeah, thats why i forgot whether it was the broken one at first
[07:08:32] <Grinnz> anyway most of this would not be a problem if we "simply" had core ssl support
[07:08:47] <Grinnz> maybe we can solve that after world hunger

[20:29:55] <Grinnz> in that case the solution is either to send smaller queries or adjust the max_allowed_packet server setting
[20:31:07] <BLZbubba> the queries are definitely not too large. i'll check out DBIx::Connector

[20:41:34] <greyrat> What's the best perl IDE? I tried my Doom Emacs on it, but it was really barebones; In particular, it did not have any completion or documentation support.
[20:42:30] <gordonfish> TBH, I don't recall running into this problem in mariadb. Either it's fixed there or I've just been lucky.
[20:42:54] <gordonfish> (That is, timeouts on large queries and such.)
[20:44:18] <gordonfish> dansan: I can't help but recall how Microsoft tried to make an entire filesytem a database (WinFS iirc) before scapping the idea.
[20:44:32] <BLZbubba> it doesn't happen very often but often enough that i need to deal with it.  unfortunately this means that whatever fix i implement may or may not solve the problem.  DBIx::Connector looks easy enough to try so I'll give that a go
[20:44:51] <gordonfish> s/scapping/scrapping/
[20:45:13] <BLZbubba> i used to use a fuse filesystem called mysqlfs, it was pretty good as long as you didn't need mmap or anything crazy like that
[20:45:44] <thrig> or performance, or locking, or 
[20:46:02] <BLZbubba> right
[20:46:44] <gordonfish> thrig: It couldn't just implement file locking as table locking or similar?
[20:47:25] <Grinnz> a filesystem is just a different kind of database really
[20:47:26] * gordonfish tries to remember if mysql/mariadb is capable of locking individual rows in a table
[20:47:44] <BLZbubba> that is an innodb feature i believe
[20:47:51] <Grinnz> but i wouldn't use any of the ones that aren't designed for it, and especially not mysql
[20:48:31] <gordonfish> Yeah definitely not mysql. Postgresql might be good
[20:48:54] <Grinnz> BLZbubba: the biggest challenge of switching to DBIx::Connector is you need to pass around the connector object instead of the $dbh, and nest all your individual usages of the $dbh in ->run or ->txn callbacks
[20:49:05] <Grinnz> so it's a little bit of refactoring to use it properly, but it's worth it
[20:49:23] <Grinnz> the connector object can be held onto forever and through forks safely, unlike $dbh
[20:50:14] <Grinnz> you can also get a ->dbh directly from the connector object at the point where you need to ensure there's a connection, if you want to ease your refactoring a bit
[20:50:18] <gordonfish> It helps if you already have a query wrapper routine already
[20:50:49] <Grinnz> it's just a little less efficient since ->dbh needs to ping the db always, whereas ->run with the fixup strategy only needs to if it lost connection

[20:54:55] <gordonfish> Many times over the years when I've done more serious sql db stuff, I've had specific routines for handling and running queries (often using SQL::Abstract for helpers) so I just have to modify one function to improve/fix things as times goes on. Always made it much easier.

[20:56:11] <gordonfish> A lot of frameworks do that sort of thing as well, and it's not uncommon to see that in mojo app modal modules, catalyst, etc.
[20:57:31] <gordonfish> So everything that needs to get data uses the abstracted routines that in turn use the general query routines. Done well, you have a nice tidy (read: easy to maintain) system.
[20:57:43] <Grinnz> abstraction is helpful but a tradeoff for performance sometimes
[20:58:17] <Grinnz> (DBIx::Connector alrready makes that tradeoff for the callbacks, but it's negligible compared to the overhead of communicating with a database)
[20:58:27] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Which is why it's good to not over do it, just what's needed to make maintainabilty more sane.

[21:55:01] <xenu> also they can be emulated with junction tables in relational databases
[21:55:14] <xenu> it's just a little bit less convenient
[21:56:11] <xenu> tbh i expect that in the future traditional relational databases will provide support for graph data
[21:56:14] <xenu> mssql already does that
[21:56:40] <xenu> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/graphs/sql-graph-architecture?view=sql-server-ver15
[21:56:41] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ SQL Graph Architecture - SQL Server | Microsoft Docs ]
[21:56:43] <laidback_01> xenu okay... boiling this down to what I *want*.  I'd like to have a load redundant system - such that multiple select or read requests/queries would be spread out over multiple physical machines.  I don't care if I have to learn new tech - but I *do* like postgresql.  
[21:57:13] <Grinnz> that's just readonly replication
[21:57:38] <xenu> yeah that seems completely unrelated to the data model
[21:57:39] <laidback_01> so... I'm leaning towards running a postgres 'cluster' if that is something that can make it all work for me.  
[21:58:13] <zgu> isn't a single postgres server called a cluster?
[21:58:21] <laidback_01> okay, I'm...  stumbling.  because one of the 'sale' points of graphdb and nosql is to run over multiple physicals thereby increasing performance.
[21:59:04] <laidback_01> my issue - what I'm trying to solve - my reports that run in a mix of perl, R, accessing SQL Server, Postgres, and two from piles of XML...  my reports are slow and yield a LOT of complaints.
[21:59:07] <xenu> if you're fine with single master and multiple read-only replicas it's *trivial* with any relational database
[21:59:23] <thrig> or LDAP!
[21:59:41] <xenu> if you want to spread writes over multiple servers (sharding) look at citusdb for example
[21:59:56] <laidback_01> citrus or citus db?
[22:00:03] <xenu> if you want a multi-master architecture it's an extremely hard problem with various trade-offs and if you aren't an expert, you don't want that
[22:00:22] <laidback_01> okay, I'm not an expert, and have ruled out multi-master a while back
[22:00:41] <xenu> https://github.com/citusdata/citus
[22:00:41] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ GitHub - citusdata/citus: Distributed PostgreSQL as an extension ]
[22:01:10] <laidback_01> okay, I'll look
[22:01:14] <laidback_01> thanks much
[22:01:45] <Grinnz> pretty much every db designed to be scalable has a way to set up sharding and/or clusters, it's not at all exclusive to nosql
[22:01:57] <Grinnz> just some may make it easier than others
[22:02:31] <Grinnz> you don't need sharding just to have readonly replicas
[22:03:20] <thrig> sharding is to avoid severity 1 tickets by having 19% of customers in each shard, where a sev-1 ticket is something impacting 20% of customers
[22:03:33] <xenu> lol
[22:03:38] <thrig> see? not a sev-1.
[22:03:59] <laidback_01> lol, that's great!
[22:05:59] <laidback_01> okay, I'll start with the simplest solution - multiple read-only replicas.  I can do that pretty simply so... that'll be an interesting exercise to perform.  I've got a neo4j system up as well, and will apply what I learn from this book.  should be a fun run.
[22:06:06] <laidback_01> thanks folks, appreciate the input.
