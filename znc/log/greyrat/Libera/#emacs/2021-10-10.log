[00:01:05] <pjb> there's diff-buffers, but it doesn't respect the narrowed region, so it cannot help here.  You'd have to save the two regions to files…
[00:01:15] <pjb> or copy-and-paste them to temporary buffers.
[00:01:32] <pjb> It would be nice if diff-buffers had an option to consider only the narrowed region.

[04:15:08] <rdrg109> daveo: I just like to follow the WIkidata approach for storing knowledge. This is what I would do if I were you, every recipe would be treated as a node and then I would use the PROPERTIES drawer to classify each recipe. Here's an example: http://0x0.st/-Ejy.org

[04:18:16] <rdrg109> I like using the Wikidata approach (i.e. storing metadata as properties) because that way you get rid of the classification problem in hierarchical documents. Here's an example of such problem: Suppose there is a recipe that is both a dessert and a bread. Would you put it under the section "Bread" or "Dessert"? By using this approach, you would use :TYPE+: bread and :TYPE+: dessert.
[04:18:28] <daveo> aindilis_: i will check that also, thaks

[04:24:20] <aindilis_> the problem for me is that hasFriend has to be declared (in the LISP-like language I'm using), and same with aindilis and rdrg109.  So I'd like to only declare these once, and if you have such an assertion stored in any of hasFriend.lisp, aindilis.lisp or rdrg109.lisp, you only have a 1/3 chance of having it load properly
[04:25:00] <aindilis_> so I'm interested in how the Wikidata approach would work there

[06:16:22] <bpalmer> Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy is a stunning indictment of organized religion in the US
[06:17:50] <grym> "loki, you know for a fact that god exists.  you've been in her presence.  and yet i just heard you profess to be an athiest"  "man i just love screwing with the clergy"

[06:20:27] <bpalmer> I wonder if the presence of dragons in the upcoming Targaryen show will have an impact on their religious talk
[06:27:39] <bpalmer> somewhat apropos, I was listening to a discussion on the radio earlier about the novel _Lolita_ by Vladimir Nabokov; one point that the show's guest made was that it includes a foreword setting up a frame story in which the main character is labelled a monster
[06:28:05] <grym> sure does
[06:28:26] <grym> and the play within a play of Taming is being staged for a drunk hayseed 
[06:28:28] <bpalmer> So she was encouraging listeners to make sure to read the whole thing, even a boring semi-academic foreword, to establish the context that she had skipped over completely when she read it for the first time
[06:29:14] <grym> i read a pretty insightful essay that wound up going for some similiarties between lolita and huck finn as essentially american tragicomedies
[06:29:16] <bpalmer> I feel like the frame story around The Handmaid's Tale is also often skipped over.
[06:29:31] <bpalmer> grym: Taming? Taming of the Shrew?
[06:30:13] <grym> bpalmer: yes
[06:30:25] <grym> there's an intro that's rarely performed
[06:30:33] <grym> the nabakov essay: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/14/nabokov-steinberg-and-me 
[06:31:14] <bpalmer> I will need to re-read that; I definitely don't remember a frame story
[06:31:19] <grym> "Horror and comedy entangle themselves with each other in these great American works of satire until our laughter and our recoiling become almost the same."
[06:32:01] <grym> bpalmer: there's a lord visiting a tavern on travel and they find a local, get him blackout drunk, and then dress him up as a lord too and when he wakes up, treat him like one for a while to see how he'll act

[20:04:30] <parsnip> how do you stay away from terminals?
[20:04:55] <codingquark> For example, I try to use rgrep instead of running grep from TUI
[20:05:10] <parsnip> i use grep more often in emacs, probably
[20:05:11] <codingquark> Or use elpher instead of lynx

[20:08:15] <artefact> trying to replace some of my use cases with dired, but i've grown to rely on C-r too much for stuff
[20:08:17] <codingquark> parsnip, artefact: how do you decide when to use each? Is there some underlying patterns perhaps?
[20:10:11] <artefact> muscle memory mostly. s-<ret> has been my "open a terminal window" shortcut for a decade
[20:10:20] <artefact> trying to wean off that and "grok" emacs more
[20:10:42] <parsnip> i can do C-c t to open a terminal after a directory prompt
[20:10:47] <artefact> for eg playing back media, i still use mpv inside a terminal, i find the globbing and history features vastly superior
[20:11:04] *** Quits: natrys (~natrys@user/natrys) (Quit: natrys)
[20:11:30] <artefact> vterm has a neat directory syncing feature, so one shortcut opens in the buffer's current directory. and you can jump back to dired (dired-jump) and maintain the same directory. or C-x C-f from that directory, etc
[20:11:34] <codingquark> I didn't mean to ask how you switch between to in literal terms... I meant more in the sense of "hmm, I better TUI for this" vs "I will use emacs to do this"
[20:11:39] <parsnip> http://ix.io/3BnH
[20:12:08] <artefact> decade(s) of muscle memory, for me, mostly. if the emacs way is too complicated or too long i'll stick to the path of least effort, memory wise
[20:12:32] *** Joins: natrys (~natrys@user/natrys)
[20:12:36] <artefact> for instance using mu4e instead of mutt was very easy. going from mpv in a xterm to, eg, emms, was a huge "nope, f*ck that"

[20:54:24] <corwin> ,,bisect,, I guess
[20:54:25] <fsbot> bisect is [0] If you can reproduce your issue reliably in a new emacs, try bisecting your user-init-file
[20:54:25] <fsbot> [1] Comment out lower half of your init file and try to reproduce the issue. Recurse as needed.
[20:54:25] <fsbot> [2] Use M-; to comment or uncomment selected region

[20:54:41] <catern> yeah so it happens even if I comment out my entire init.el :)
[20:54:51] <corwin> can you make it happen under -Q ?

[20:55:05] <corwin> do you have an early-init?

[23:25:30] <dale> artefact: I think I'd be fine with Flymake if not for the fact that Flycheck just has so many checkers working out of the box.
[23:25:52] <technomancy> artefact: using a shebang with an option in it isn't very portable
[23:25:59] <artefact> i've read that flymake has gotten better and essentially feature parity over the years, but apparently its usability out of the box leaves a bit to be desired
[23:26:30] <aidalgol> technomancy: Isn't it?
[23:26:32] <artefact> technomancy: i think it is. guile also uses that trick for scripting
