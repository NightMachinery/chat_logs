[07:09:34] <twb> I mean that cpython's original dict implementation, because it was dumb and slow, happened to be stable

[07:09:46] <aidalgol> ah
[07:10:01] <twb> so then they had to have a flag day when the default implementation changed, and also keep the old implementation around and allow things to opt into it
[07:10:26] <aidalgol> I mean... a dictionary, the abstract concept, makes no guarantees about order, so anyone relying on order is at fault.

[08:40:26] <itsmemoria> I find myself learn best when trying to make some toy projects with a language. Now I have to find something nice and simple to make with C (and may be C++ later)
[08:40:26] <burikko> i learned c in a few hours on a plane flight by reading k and r
[08:40:42] <itsmemoria> @burikko: "k and r"?
[08:40:50] <burikko> original book about c
[08:40:55] <bpalmer> Kernighan and Ritchie, a very classic book about C
[08:41:29] <bpalmer> (Kernighan and Ritchie are the two authors; the name is "The C Programming Language")
[08:41:38] <burikko> ...for an interview :)
[08:41:57] <itsmemoria> @burikko wow, that was impressive!
[08:42:05] <itsmemoria> @bpalmer: I'm looking for the book now. thank you
[08:42:20] <bpalmer> I wonder where my copy is.
[08:42:30] <burikko> there might be an updated or better one as the language changed slightly with ansi
[08:42:54] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.134) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:43:02] <bpalmer> K&R 's 2nd edition was updated for the first round of ANSI C.
[08:43:15] <burikko> that'd be a good choice then probably
[08:43:43] <bpalmer> However, C has evolved somewhat since then, so there are new features in the language which it presumably doesn't cover.
[08:43:58] <burikko> ok
[08:44:04] <bpalmer> But , for someone just learning the language, the meatiest part will be covered.
[08:44:11] <itsmemoria> The latest edition is 2nd edition (1988)
[08:44:30] <burikko> i remember a footnote sayings omething like "it is agreed that the ice is thin here"

[08:50:12] <wickedjargon> bpalmer, I've heard that K&R has outdated information and for that reason I haven't read it yet.
[08:50:42] <wickedjargon> Do you think it's best to use a newer book that covers more recent standards?
[08:51:31] <bpalmer> For the basics of the language: syntax, pointers, a particular sense of "style," it's more than fine
[08:52:43] <bpalmer> for someone who's going to be a practicing C programmer, there's a lot more to learn (e.g., I doubt K&R focus at all on why you should be using strncpy rather than strcpy, or memmove vs memcpy, or how to organize a multi-file project, or ...)

[11:48:02] <talismanick> to paraphrase a Redditor, why isn't this the default?
[11:48:06] <talismanick> Does it break something?
[11:49:54] <aidalgol> talismanick: The answer to that question is usually, "Because the core devs are *really* hesitant to change *any* default."
[11:50:09] <kensanata> I think that X11 doesn't have a clipboard by default. Each application can say "I have an active selection" and another application can say "Please insert the active selection here" and then X11 basically does a process-to-process communication thingy.
[11:50:31] <aidalgol> I'd recommend going a step further than setting x-select-enable-primary, and install a clipboard manager.
[11:50:41] <kensanata> So if you kill the window with the active selection, then there's nothing left on a clipboard anywhere. Unless you install a clipboard manager. :D

I got a very mild headache for one day after the second shot, and all my (adulut) family got vaccinated with similarly no/low side-effects, but sure that's just anecdotical evidence; the "hard data" is pretty clear that bad side effects with the vaccines, especially the mRNA ones, are very very rare, much more than the life they save
[12:20:17] <kilobug> rnkn: I guess they are spread everywhere, like an informational virus :/
[12:20:30] <kilobug> rnkn: and scientific litteracy is only vaccine against it :)

[12:21:41] <kakuhen> and afterwards not much else
[12:21:57] <empwilli_> kilobug: also, take care to differenciate between the side effects and imune reaction. IMHO it's important not to call all reactions side effects since this has a huge impact on the public perception

[12:22:52] <pjb> rnkn: but the dictionnaries have been rewritten, we're living in a pure Orwellian world, 1984.
[12:22:53] <kakuhen> empwilli_: i think it's fair to call any reaction (besides strengthened immunity) a side effect
[12:23:13] <kakuhen> sure, "side effect" has a negative connotation to most people, but it shouldn't
[12:23:34] <pjb> Well, when it involves illness and death, yes, it's negative.
[12:23:59] <pjb> Only for the people who don't take it, it's possitive, since more death = more money and more cake for the remaining.
[12:24:23] <pjb> Before, they just made some war, but with the nuke, it's too dangerous to start a war nowadays.
[12:24:42] <kilobug> I invoke Poe's law
[12:25:02] <twb> pjb: AFAICT the overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that the harms of a vaccine are VASTLY outweighed by the benefits – and this applies to everything from polio to sars-ncov-2.

[13:15:18] <danrobi70> no body knows where emacs save our keybinds?
[13:16:03] <kakuhen> the default keybinds should be in place unless you are loading an elisp file that is changing them
[13:16:07] <kakuhen> or you activate a mode like cua-mode

[13:17:25] <danrobi70> I mean emacs keep previous saved keybinds. I now have 3 binds here that does the exact same command
[13:17:59] <danrobi70> kakuhen: 's' is good now
[13:18:21] <kakuhen> then it's probably being stored in your init.el (or .emacs)
[13:18:54] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:19:52] <danrobi70> no .emacs here only .emacs.d/init.el. What Im saying is that emacs keep saved previous binds. They're not in my init.el anymore but still bind to emacs command.
[13:20:19] <danrobi70> so emacs must have a saved file somewhere 
[13:20:50] <rnkn> danrobi70: like any language interpreter, Emacs' Lisp interpreter stores all its symbol values in memory until it exits
[13:21:17] <danrobi70> ok will restart. brb
[13:21:24] <rnkn> danrobi70: if you see the same behaviour after restarting it means you have bound `s' to something in your init file

[13:21:44] <kakuhen> yeah, the fact 's' worked when running "emacs -q" suggests that it has to be in your init.el file

[15:06:58] <fub4rovicz> does gnu emacs not have issues with memory safety/leaks? :D
[15:07:05] <taeaad> Isn't that just a human nature thing, kind of like how we want a new banana every day.
[15:07:10] <rnkn> it's similar to the oft repeated desire to rewrite Emacs in something else; fundamentally misunderstands what the thing *is*

[15:12:12] *** Joins: genieliu (~genieliu@103.37.140.25)
[15:12:21] <rnkn> fub4rovicz: e.g. I might have a desire for Emacs to do a thing in an easier way, so I write a little Elisp program... then someone comes along and says "let's rewrite Emacs in $LANG!" -- why would I rewrite my little program?
[15:13:52] <fub4rovicz> to me, it sounds like really nice idea to replace the elisp-engine with guile (which also supports elisp) but reading https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuileEmacs, it looks like that plan died
[15:14:03] <bremner> rnkn: OK, but I think the rusting rusters only want(ed) to rewrite the C core?
[15:14:29] <kilobug> rnkn: I think people who want to "rewrite emacs" just want to rewrite the C part, the Elisp VM, not all the Lisp code

[15:15:36] <rnkn> I think the reason all these plans fail is because the people who wrote the original C did it because they wanted the thing to exist

[15:16:09] <bremner> I have seen discussion about incremental rewrites in Rust. Maybe for more modular things that works well.

[15:19:35] <jaffachief> It's also such a waste of effort. Why rewrite stuff that's working more or less fine?

[19:29:48] <kensanata> I guess it's just a big questionmark I have. Who makes these binaries? Do they contain crypto miners? Even if they don't ransom your system because they're in a chroot, they can still do damage, infect visitors with malware, and so on.

[19:30:49] <kensanata> So one way to keep that in check is installing sources from known places, like CPAN, or using packages for your system. I am a big believer in Debian package maintainers. Dunno how that works for OpenBSD, though.

[19:31:45] <kensanata> Aurora_v_kosmose: hm, I see.

[20:44:12] <rnkn> and of course I'm using Emacs for the screenplay [REDACTED DUE TO NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT] which is about [REDACTED DUE TO NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT] 
[20:44:14] <acdw> one day, i'll write a screenplay in emacs <3

[20:58:05] <yrk> it isn't that emms invents a separate playlist from mpd's playlist. it is that emms is designed around managing its own playlists. so naturally syncronizing between emms and mpd is tricky. that having been said, emms admittedly does a poor job of it
