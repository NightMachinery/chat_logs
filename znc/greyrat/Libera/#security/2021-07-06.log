[06:04:45] <brownorange> Fundamentally security is very much a hardware expert's game. If you can't verify hardware specs, and you can't screw around with the electronics, you have only insecurity.
[06:06:44] * flyback wants to play with dumping the state of a uninitialized ram chip into a linear feedback shift register for some hw rng without using a cpu
[06:06:51] <flyback> just for the canuck of it
[06:07:13] <flyback> will have to figure out how to read out the ram chip without a cpu
[06:07:21] <flyback> guess I can hard code the address pins
[06:08:20] <flyback> mabye use the linear feedback shift register output to cycle the ram chip on/off resample once in a while
[06:08:34] <flyback> mabye also use the output bits to dick with a programable voltage regulator going to the ram chip

[06:13:44] <brownorange> @flyback is that to catch memory that didn't dissipate or to catch secret insertions of backdoors into memory?
[06:14:03] <flyback> no its to generate random numbers since computers suck at it
[06:14:30] <flyback> ram comes up in random states when powered on
[06:15:29] <brownorange> how long does it have to be off, for the random states to arise?
[06:16:12] <circuitbone> define the kind of memory
[06:16:22] <flyback> dunno
[06:16:36] <flyback> just read someone's paper on doing it using a mcu and thougth it might be fun
[06:16:51] <flyback> nice for generating random patterns for lights or for crypto for a small mcu
[06:17:28] <brownorange> ddr4
[06:18:35] <hobuster> can also film lava lamps
[06:19:07] <flyback> https://hackaday.com/2015/06/29/true-random-number-generator-for-a-true-hacker/
[06:19:17] <flyback> hobuster, this is smaller and uses way less power
[06:19:24] <flyback> but not a bad source of randomness
[06:22:29] <flyback> anyways it's just for fun
[06:22:44] <flyback> mabye a future version of my xmas tree lighting system
[06:23:04] <flyback> I lucked out on the first version the rgb auto cycling leds I bought are not compensated internally
[06:23:08] <flyback> so they are all random timing
[06:23:22] <flyback> so I didn't have to randomize the pattern, they all drift apart
[06:24:02] <flyback> but it's also useful for very low end mcu's that need a source of low power cheap random numbers

[06:24:24] <brownorange> i suppose i could just jump the shark and install a cpu in my head. although i'm not sure how i would code on it. and i'd have to connect its output to my eyes somehow
[06:25:55] <brownorange> but the cpu might overheat and kill me or if i executed bad code i might crash my brain. not a good idea
[06:27:58] <brownorange> if i wanted to share data i'd also need an antenna to raise out of my head

[06:36:29] <brownorange> nanites might be a more plausible way to store data and do computations. but i dont think linux runs on nanites, let alone any particular distro i might want to use
[06:37:58] <brownorange> ok then instead nanites can travel into the cpu and maybe overwrite the microcode
[06:38:29] <brownorange> and if they're really smart they can do this for any cpu. and so i'd have freedom of computational again

[21:05:00] <newbie2021> NiLon: what cases? please, i am a noob
[21:05:36] <NiLon> maybe we should start from what kind of surveillance you are trying to avoid
[21:06:07] <newbie2021> NiLon: well... Corporations like Google and small companies too collecting data
[21:06:08] <NiLon> knowing your enemy is the most important thing, you can't just "protect" against everything unless you literally unplug yourself from internet
[21:06:09] *** Joins: squatch (~squatch@50.39.205.217)
[21:06:59] <newbie2021> this is the first step. Avoid commercial surveillance
[21:07:56] <NiLon> you mean like ads gathering information about your habbits?
[21:08:06] <electr0n> well unfortunately, you do not own the pipes that carry your data (packets) across the internet to the intended destination. That footprint can easily be correlated by your ISP
[21:09:30] <newbie2021> NiLon: yeah, soft of. You know. Google knows your biography 100x better than you. They got your psychological portret. It's crazy, if you think about it
[21:09:55] <newbie2021> i am using google  like for 16 years maybe. And it's crazy how much it knows about me
[21:10:42] <newbie2021> electr0n: tools like Qubes OS or virtual machines can help? Via Tor and other stuff
[21:10:46] <NiLon> well let's say you are using vpn or some sort of proxy to mask your ip. You then also disable javascript so that no some tracking stuff can be planted. But the browser you are using is still leaking information about you
[21:11:03] <NiLon> let's say million people use the same ip, various devices and browsers
[21:11:25] <NiLon> lynx is fairly uncommon, so just by filtering out all lynx users, you already have like maybe 10 users out of that million
[21:11:52] <NiLon> now they could look that this same agent always visits facebook at 12:00 and then he goes to bbc news at 12:15 every day
[21:12:03] <NiLon> and you are now identified
[21:12:53] <newbie2021> NiLon: yeah, but this info is not useful to them. Only if CIA or something will look for me
[21:12:58] <NiLon> so using the common browser, with common settings, as most people would use it is better than using some unique setup
[21:13:12] <newbie2021> the goal is to minimise info
[21:14:05] <electr0n> that is definitely possible. I do not know much about Qubes or Tails but I know they are both popular with the journalist community.
[21:14:05] <NiLon> yeah well, use adblockers, maybe vpn/proxy whatever and don't log into social sites etc.
[21:14:30] <electr0n> I would personally stop using social media but that is for another conversation.
[21:15:14] <newbie2021> NiLon: tor is more trustworthy. Although many resources start to block it. Also, duckduckgo give bad results. They are very different from google's
[21:15:48] <skill> bad results as in unusable or not personalized? :D

[21:17:56] <skill> newbie2021: ah so relevance, i've had mixed results with duckduck. But for any search that requires a bit of context about me, then unfortunately I rely on the power of what google knows about me :/
[21:18:10] <skill> but my threat model is different
[21:19:03] <NiLon> it took while to learn that if you search "barber" it doesn't give in result of a company next to you :p
[21:19:21] <NiLon> but once you learn the attitude that it's not personalized result, it works quite well
[21:19:52] <skill> exactly
[21:20:12] <newbie2021> ok
[21:22:15] <newbie2021> Also, guys. How do you solve problems with logins and emails? There are no email services where you don't need your phone number?
[21:22:41] <newbie2021> Passwords are other topic as well
[21:22:46] <NiLon> I don't think protonmail ever asked for phone number
[21:22:47] <newbie2021> Login names and passwords
[21:23:15] <newbie2021> NiLon: i think it asks. Maybe you registered long ago when it didn't ask for it
[21:23:15] <NiLon> keepassxc is my personal preference
[21:23:20] <skill> agree, i don't believe protonmail asked for phone #
[21:24:12] <newbie2021> NiLon: i use it too. But you use the same login? If you use the same login - it's crazy how much an attacker can know about you
[21:24:34] <skill> that's a cool feature apple is adding, random icloud emails upon form entry
[21:24:35] <NiLon> what you mean same login?
[21:25:19] <newbie2021> NiLon: nickname. "NiLon" or "NiLon"-like in many different resources
[21:25:41] <NiLon> well sure. But I'm not trying to hide
[21:26:12] <newbie2021> NiLon: it's actually pretty crazy. It's about hackers. There is a lot of info about you in internet
[21:26:13] <almarwazi> newbie2021: There are plenty of emails that don't require phone nos. or email, mostly non-profit ones. Some of those are have closed new registrations (like snopyta.org & dismail.de). Disroot.org is still open & I highly recommend it. It however asks for email for confirmation once & that email address won't be required by them anymore (optional).
[21:26:20] <NiLon> I'm totally fine if someone finds me in twitter with same nick than in irc
[21:26:27] <uoj6wz6qoswb> they ask over hidden service freenode hides spam filtering behind email and email hides spam filtering behind mobile
[21:26:29] <NiLon> tho I don't use twitter, so that is unlikely :p
[21:27:23] <uoj6wz6qoswb> theres hordes of people that use email verification as a hand off to larger companies with more capability in doxxing users and the only thing they can use to doxx users is mobile numbers
[21:27:32] <NiLon> well you don't even need to be a hacker to get all the info
[21:28:45] <uoj6wz6qoswb> all the ways to get spoofed phone numbers normally involve a trust hand off point from someone reselling so you get doxxed or they get shut down pretty quick and trying to do it with burners is impossible to avoid a lat long doxx
[21:28:57] <NiLon> personally I have already accepted the fact that all of my information is leaked and there is nothing to do about that. You just want to minimize the way how that data can be used

[21:54:37] <newbie2021> also. GNU Icecat looks like a good choice. GNU is trustable and they say it has no telemetry. There are browsers like Palemoon, but there are from random guys

[22:04:48] <ajak> you're really not going to get better than firefox
[22:05:08] <ajak> any esoteric browser is going to be more fingerprintable than firefox
[22:05:27] <newbie2021> ajak: Why? IceCat is a Firefox from Stallman
[22:05:36] <newbie2021> don't you respect him. Huh???
[22:06:15] <ajak> not really but that's beside the point
[22:07:02] <ajak> icecat is probably more fingerprintable, you should also look into how often icecat is updated compared to firefox
[22:07:15] <newbie2021> Stallman is a guy that i could trust. Libre must have a leader like him. Otherwise they are not trustable
[22:07:28] <newbie2021> ok, thanks for advice
[22:07:30] <ajak> every firefox major release has security fixes, so if icecat lags behind firefox you're just making yourself vulnerable
