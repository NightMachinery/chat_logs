[20:41:05] <The-Compiler> eoc: also I think you can run qutebrowser in a framebuffer, though last time I tried I wasn't able to exit it or switch TTYs anymore
[20:42:04] <eoc> oh interesting :]

[20:42:17] <keir> tee hee
[20:43:23] <nimaje> afaik has emacs some browser there you can probably configure vim keybindings

[21:28:43] <kuhilas> I have installed bunch of fonts to my Argh linux. I can see them with "fc-list" command. Then I have set a config-cycle for content.user_stylesheets and I can change the font on the fly with a key bind. It works with "Dejavu Sans Mono" and only few others, but not with interesting custom ttf fonts I have downloaded from 1001fonts. I want to try some cursive fonts. It only changes the size of the characters on all of them
[21:29:57] <kuhilas> * { font-family: "Dejavu Sans Mono", cursive !important; }
[21:31:15] <kuhilas> I only have that one line on my custom css file. That works, but if I replace "Dejavu Sans Mono" with for example "October Twilight" it doesn't work. fc-list shows it like this /usr/share/fonts/myfonts/October Twilight.ttf: October Twilight:style=Regular
[21:33:38] <kuhilas> http://sprunge.us/SgMPoB
[21:36:25] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: probably not related to qutebrowser directly - can you try using them in Chromium via devtools?
[21:37:27] <kuhilas> I don't have a chromium, but I have firefox
[21:41:26] <kuhilas> in firefox it changes to "OCtober Twilight" in https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-style.asp this page if I edit in inspect mode the html, body { font-family: value
[21:42:29] <kuhilas> in qutebrowser if I try do it that way it doesn't :/
[21:46:01] <birkoff> although it's invalid, using css column-gap: css property with display:flex; works on chrome based browser and even Firefox but not on qutebrowser (2.3.1)
[21:48:36] <The-Compiler> birkoff: probably just because it's an older underlying Chromium
[21:49:29] <birkoff> oh when is it going to update then ? 
[21:53:18] <kuhilas> I installed Chromium, and changing to October Twilight font via devtools there works 
[21:54:49] <kuhilas> does this mean that it would get fixed when/if qutebrowser uptades to a newer version?

[22:18:36] *** Joins: reset (~reset@user/reset)
[22:22:26] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: My answer was to birkoff, not you - though in your case, if it works in Chromium, this might be the case too.
[22:22:44] <The-Compiler> birkoff: Depends. What does your :version say about your QtWebEngine/Chromium version?
[22:24:06] <The-Compiler> birkoff, kuhilas: In theory, there's nothing qutebrowser needs to adapt for QtWebEngine upgrades - sometimes that's the case, sometimes it needs workarounds for bugs, or things like the darkmode command line flags changed in Chromium or so. But the hard work of adapting things is done by the Qt people, I've heard they need a person month or so every release to adjust things. But then also some
[22:24:08] <The-Compiler> distributions and such (Ubuntu, Debian Stable, etc.) ship a rather old QtWebEngine.
[22:24:52] <The-Compiler> And now we're in a special situation, where qutebrowser is still on Qt 5.15, but there's a new Qt 6.2 with QtWebEngine support out since the end of September, which qutebrowser doesn't support yet and which requires major changes
[22:25:06] <The-Compiler> see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5395
[22:25:34] <The-Compiler> we have an experimental qt6-test branch with support, but it'll still take some while (probably early 2022 or so) until there's real support with Qt 5 support still retained
[22:26:15] <The-Compiler> it mainly requires a lot of mechnical/automated changes to the source, but those mean that the currently open PRs will all need to be updated too, so I'll try to merge some first - but that won't happen until the end of the year, busy with teaching Python to 130 students
