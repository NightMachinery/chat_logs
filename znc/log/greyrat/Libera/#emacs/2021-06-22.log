[08:57:13] <Viking667> I'm not sure who first coined the term 
[08:57:14] <jgkamat> I don't really think growth and stability are opposites - growth depends on stability, otherwise no one would use the service and it would shrink. But the opposite could also be true. 
[08:57:38] <teknikal_domain> Wait, I'm going to get pedantic here
[08:57:39] <Viking667> yah. Growth relies on something actually being there to begin with, that's probably a better way of saying it.
[08:57:48] <jgkamat> a service with 0% stability would have no growth, but a service with 100% stability could possibly grow.

[09:23:47] <teknikal_domain> Because terminal emacs can only read out of your terminal input buffer, basically. If it's running as a windowed program under the WM control, it's probably using a keyboard API and not scanning for characters

[09:28:56] <teknikal_domain> <danrobi70> ya I wonder why the keyboard diff between cli and gui 
[09:28:59] <teknikal_domain> <teknikal_domain> Maybe because how the terminal interprets certain key

[09:29:05] <teknikal_domain> <danrobi70> ah ya ^
[09:29:09] <teknikal_domain> <teknikal_domain> like the terminal interprets C-backspace as C-h
[09:29:09] <johnjay> echo echo echoooooo
[09:29:12] <teknikal_domain> <teknikal_domain> but the gui can poll the keyboard directly	        [00:53]
[09:29:12] <danrobi70> aaah
[09:29:13] <teknikal_domain> <teknikal_domain> Because terminal emacs can only read out of your terminal
[09:29:16] <teknikal_domain> 		 input buffer, basically. If it's running as a windowed

[13:52:20] <teknikal_domain> so my brain is thinking along the lines of foo(&bar) vs foo(bar)

[13:52:31] <teknikal_domain> Oh, I know.
[13:53:11] <teknikal_domain> I'm _very_ well aware, but if I can draw enough of a connection like that, I'm not likely to forget it 5 seconds later
[13:54:39] <jensecj> you can look at passing quoted function as passing function references. For technical details, I'm not entirely sure what evaluation strategy elisp uses
