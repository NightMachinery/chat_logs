[00:00:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> LordKalma: Yeah, I guess the DR on optical systems is different.  But I actually had to deal with a case the other day of someone being upset about an unwanted close-in spur that' was just south of -70dBc.  In reality, that would make NO difference to a real comms system.  
[00:00:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> And many regulated spectrum alocations only required a paltry -50dBc or worse...
[00:01:29] <LordKalma> yeah
[00:01:38] <LordKalma> I've actually was a victim of this once myself
[00:01:46] <LordKalma> I was WTFing at a FFT that has a lot of trash
[00:01:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> A spur that is many 10s of dB below your notional information content is simply a teensy bit of additional noise, and if your system isn't prepared to deal with a little bit of noise, it's not a very good system.
[00:01:58] <LordKalma> turns out I was using a floating point algorithm over what was otherwise double data
[00:02:09] <LordKalma> but the thing is... it was going to be sent to an 8 bit generator
[00:02:15] <LordKalma> so it made *literally no difference*
[00:02:28] <LordKalma> the things you forget when you look at beautiful data too much
[00:03:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> Part of the problem is also that receivers have gotten *considerably* more sensitive over the last decade or two.  Spurs that in the "olden days" wouldn't even have been *observed* are now annoying little blips on your FFT.

[14:34:52] <drmpeg> This is the right place.

[14:35:51] <boru> Great, thank you. I'll stick around to see if he has any ideas.
[14:36:30] <drmpeg> He's in the EU, so he's probably awake.
[14:37:19] <boru> If it's helpful, the output of `volk-config-info --machine` is: avx512cd_64_mmx_orc
[14:39:29] <JDemel[m]> boru: This requires a bit more info. Which VOLK version did you install? Probably important on FreeBSD: which cpu_features version is installed? and how? A "1950X" is an AMD Ryzen smth smth, correct? Further, it might be interesting to run `volk-config-info --avail-machines` and `volk-config-info --all-machines`. The output of `list_cpu_features` (if available) would be useful too. Finally, the FreeBSD equivalent of `cat /proc/cpuinfo` would
[14:39:29] <JDemel[m]> be necessary.
[14:44:02] <drmpeg> Looks like the 1950x does not support AVX512.
[14:45:48] <boru> JDemel[m]; thanks for the response; one moment, and I'll gather up these bits of information.
[14:52:59] <boru> JDemel[m]; http://sprunge.us/D0UI5R -- if I can provide further information, please let me know.
[15:07:12] <JDemel[m]> boru: This is still tricky. Is `list_cpu_features` available? If so, what does it report?

[15:12:42] <JDemel[m]> My suspicion is that cpu_features is either too old, or broken on FreeBSD. In any case, it'd be important to know which `cpu_features` version is used. cpu_features received FreeBSD support rather recently. Maybe the version on your system is too old. Also, cpu_features needs a new release that includes FreeBSD support.
[15:35:04] <boru> JDemel[m]; sure, here's the output: http://sprunge.us/GBsyyn
[15:36:15] <boru> The libvolk FreeBSD port clones the `cpu_features` submodule, fwiw. The `cpu_features` in packages is v0.6.0.
[15:37:33] <boru> Is there a way to force the ISA feature set at compile time with cmake defines or anything like that?

[16:38:00] <LordKalma> I thought grc used qt?
[16:38:30] <BarryDuggan[m]> s: the sequence of events is
[16:38:30] <BarryDuggan[m]> - user creates a flowgraph with gnuradio-companion
[16:38:30] <BarryDuggan[m]> - clicking the Generate icon creates a Python program
[16:38:30] <BarryDuggan[m]> - executing the flowgraph executes the Python program
[16:40:28] <willcode4[m]> LordKalma: GRC currently uses PyGTK and a port to PyQT is in the works.
[16:40:48] <LordKalma> oh cool
[16:40:59] <LordKalma> why pyqt and not pyside ? just out of curiosity
[16:43:48] <willcode4[m]> Don't know. I've always used PyQT for no particular reason, and I thought they were pretty much equivalent. HÃ¥kon VÃ¥gsether is doing the port, and might have more info.
[16:46:43] <s[m]12> <willcode4[m]> "s: GRC files are YAML and..." <- Ok thanks,Is GUI code for main window fully in gnuradio/grc/gui/ .Does Gtk use any XML file?
[16:47:20] <willcode4[m]> LordKalma: From what I see online, PyQt is likely more up to date and the main difference is in licensing. SInce GR is GPL, we don't care if one of our dependencies is GPL vs LGPL.
[16:47:50] <willcode4[m]> s: Older versions of GR use XML. 3.9+ use YAML.
[16:47:52] <LordKalma> more up to date? really? interesting
[16:50:17] <willcode4[m]> LordKalma: That may have just been for Qt5 back a few years ago. They are probably equivalent now.
[16:50:44] <willcode4[m]> s: Yes, the GUI portion of GRC is under that directory.
[16:51:50] <willcode4[m]> But the GUI code uses the non-GUI code, so it's hard to say that it's really ALL under the /gui dir.
[16:52:50] <s[m]12> Ok, Thank you
[16:54:33] <s[m]12> Now I am more excited to learn the code.
[17:14:36] <JDemel[m]> <boru> "JDemel; sure, here's the output:..." <- This is interesting. Apparently, `list_cpu_features` reports the correct set of flags but VOLK receives different information.
[17:14:36] <JDemel[m]> This is smth that needs more debugging. It'd be a good start to compile VOLK. Also, try the system cpu_features vs the local clone. Maybe smth like `ldd` can tell you which cpu_features lib is used. But! I know there was an issue with FreeBSD that got fixed late last year and cpu_features didn't have a release since. 
[17:14:36] <JDemel[m]> You can compile VOLK and add some more lines like: https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/blob/ce4e4a00fc953f3451bfcdd4310b03785d8b4055/lib/CMakeLists.txt#L207
[17:14:36] <JDemel[m]> That'd overrule AVX512 etc. detection. Just use them outside the if statement.
[17:17:06] <boru> JDemel[m]; ah, interesting. I'll do some more investigation wrt the library installed from packages vs. the submodule, and also try the cmake amendments. Thanks for getting back to me.
[17:17:13] <boru> I'll let you know what it turns up.

[18:13:14] <LordKalma> ah well, fair enough :)
[18:26:10] <noc0lour_> I think some bits and pieces in dvb-t are handwritten SIMD
[18:26:15] <noc0lour_> gr-dtv
[18:27:57] <drmpeg> Yeah, the Viterbi decoder has some SSE2 code.
[18:27:57] <noc0lour_> und wenn man das in tech-konzernen zu ende denkt bekommt man Produktentwicklung wie bei Google

[19:48:24] <DerekKozel[m]> s: I think you're asking if the GTK GUI uses any XML files to describe the GRC application. It doesn't, all the GUI is done purely in code. Software to graphically edit the interface like QtCreator aren't used.

[23:55:39] <jacob_theknight[> Hello, sorry to bother everyone, but I found a post with a similar issue that I was having- https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2018-04/msg00252.html. I assume from the lack of a response that it worked for the person who asked the question (and hopefully me). However, I'm not sure what exactly to change in the CMAKEs since I can't even find "RUNTIME" in the default cmake produced by gr_modtool
[23:57:57] <DerekKozel[m]> What version of GNU Radio are you using Jacob? 2018 was a few years ago and things have changed in CMake
[23:58:04] <DerekKozel[m]> In GNU Radio's CMake that is
[23:58:15] <jacob_theknight[> 3.8- sorry, I should've included that
[23:58:56] <jacob_theknight[> Italso built from source, if that matters
[23:59:04] <jacob_theknight[>  * It's also built from source, if that matters
