[01:32:28] <marler8997_> cr1901 yes!!
[01:32:46] <marler8997_> holy shit this proves windows is fucking garbage!
[01:33:14] <cr1901> And that my machine is showing its age :P
[01:33:54] <marler8997_> are you on an older machine?
[01:34:06] *** Joins: mikezackles (~mikezackl@gateway/tor-sasl/mikezackles)
[01:34:36] <cr1901> Lenovo Thinkpad W520. It was new in Nov. 2011
[01:35:11] <cr1901> Core i7 Sandy Bridge. I haven't upgraded it b/c it's still a respectable machine and it still works and I believe it "taking care of my machines" :P
[01:35:19] <marler8997_> damn, so I guess this problem probably manifests more on slower older machines, hence why I never see it on my intel 11900k
[01:36:04] <marler8997_> Jesus this is so much bullshit, I'm not sure what the right play here is
[01:36:52] <cr1901> I'm afraid I wouldn't know the right solution either :P. At least _a_ (if not _the_) bug was found
[01:37:57] <marler8997_> I'm thinking I should convert this example to C and submit a bug report to microsoft somewhere
[01:38:40] <cr1901> zig translate-back-to-c
[01:40:11] <Arnavion> Turning off AV may help, but yes it's a problem in general that closing the handle doesn't immediately allow you to delete the file
[01:40:20] <marler8997_> oh as luck would have it, my MSVC install it broken, can't even include <stdio.h> are you serious Microsoft?
[01:40:32] <Arnavion> There's no point sending a bug report. It's been like that since the dawn of time
[01:40:44] <Arnavion> You have no choice but to retry
[01:41:00] <marler8997_> Arnavion, it's even worse than that
[01:41:29] <marler8997_> The main process hasn't opened a handle to any file, a child process opened a handle to it, and after it exits, the parent process can't always rename or delete it immediately
[01:41:55] <Arnavion> Yes, same thing
[01:42:10] <Arnavion> As I said, closing a handle doesn't immediately make the file available for deletion
[01:42:11] <marler8997_> Not according to Raymond: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120329-00/?p=7973
[01:43:07] <Arnavion> Also you can open the files as shared instead of exclusive, if that makes sense for what you're doing with them

[01:43:33] <marler8997_> Arnavion yeah that could help some cases
[01:43:41] <Arnavion> <marler8997_> Not according to   < I assumed you were waiting on the child process you terminated, yes. My point is even if you waited, you'd still have the problem, for the reason I gave you
[01:44:09] <marler8997_> sure but my point was this case was even worse than just opening a file/closing it
[01:44:27] <Arnavion> It's all basically the same underlying thing
[01:44:30] <marler8997_> it means the OS will signal that a process has exited before it has cleaned up all it's files
[01:44:40] <marler8997_> sure, my point was just that it's even worse
[01:44:43] <Arnavion> Things in the kernel keep files locked longer than the userspace that held them
[01:45:15] <marler8997_> they are still independent issues though
[01:45:31] <marler8997_> an os could leave handles open mid process, but then make sure they are all closed before signaling the process has exited
[01:47:33] <cr1901> Is retrying morally acceptable here :P?
[01:48:24] <marler8997_> retrying is a potential solution, it should be pretty general in that it handles alot of cases

[03:21:04] <marler8997_> cr1901 that's disgusting.  That means on Windows, RemoveDirectory will return before the directory is removed!!
[03:21:54] <Arnavion> Yes
[03:22:03] <marler8997_> I might have to think on this.  Windows is making it almost impossible to write robust software
[03:23:45] <tleydxdy[m]> if writing robust software was easy, we would have way more robust software now
[03:23:53] <tleydxdy[m]> :(
