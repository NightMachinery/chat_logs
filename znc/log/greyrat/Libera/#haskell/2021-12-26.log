[04:59:22] <Rembane> Plated zipper sounds very fancy. What problem are you trying to solve?
[05:01:55] <dsal> Day 18 of this year's AoC
[05:02:36] <dsal> I built a data structure that's like `data Pair a = Lit a | Pair (Pair a) (Pair a)` -- something like that.

[05:04:00] <dsal> It's fine… but I'm trying to see if I can do better with a zipper.  My mental model of what a zipper would do for me and what it actually does don't quite match.

[05:06:14] <EvanR> zippers are good for coming back
[05:06:26] <dsal> The zipper lets me maneuver about the structure and from any position replace part of the structure, but I still have to do extra work to go back whence I came.
[05:06:37] <EvanR> so only if you can undo in the adventure

[14:19:43] <Logio_> haskell was certainly easier to teach to people as their first language, rather than their nth

[14:24:23] <geekosaur> I'm old but not quite *that* old :)
[14:24:50] <Rembane> Logio: What were the most common things to unlearn among the n:thers? 
[14:24:59] <janus> my dad is from 1948, i saw FreePascal on his Win7 desktop yesterday :O
[14:25:51] <Rembane> I've ever only seen Pascal in modern times, have never worked in it. It still fascinates me though.
[14:26:23] <janus> if i understand correctly the best thing about Pascal is how it had length-prefixed strings by default?
[14:26:43] <geekosaur> ohm it had more than that. it had actual types
[14:26:47] <Rembane> It had, and 1-indexed arrays and strings. 
[14:26:49] <Rembane> And ranges! 
[14:27:34] <geekosaur> I was at a computer workshop between junior and senior year of high scholl, where a few lucky kids got to work with Terac IVs running Pascal. I was so pissed that I wasn't one of them
[14:28:01] <janus> what is even a range? i imagine they weren't like the ranges recently added to c++
[14:28:22] <geekosaur> var foo : 1..10;

[14:28:52] <acode> You guys are making me feel old because I had Pascal in high school now
[14:29:02] <janus> it's a datatype that wraps two integers and then a syntax shorthand for it?
[14:30:59] <geekosaur> yes. more or less like Ix in Haskell

[16:14:52] <geekosaur> basically this all looks very confused as to lists vs. items

[17:05:09] <geekosaur> so just use take or drop inside the function
[17:05:29] <int-e> I mean, you're interested in what happens with the first 11 elements of (the spine of) the list.
[17:06:33] <int-e> you're not interested in the elements which basically makes the functions that take a predicate (like takeWhile) a no-go unless you annotate the elements first, and that's a bit silly
[17:06:57] <geekosaur> that was what I hinted at earlier

[18:08:09] <geekosaur> you are removing the list and have only its first element
[18:08:31] <geekosaur> at some point you will have to learn to work with the list
[18:09:22] <otherwise> yes, although I dont know how to make a function act on listOfNums
[18:09:47] <geekosaur> most list functions will work on it
[18:09:47] <otherwise> for example, It is not clear why listOfNums 3
[18:09:54] <otherwise> is not valid
[18:09:57] <geekosaur> it will not work as a function itself
[18:10:32] <int-e> A list of functions isn't itself a function.
[18:10:34] <geekosaur> because `listOfNums 3` says "`listOfNums 3` is a function. Apply that function to the value 3"
[18:10:36] <otherwise> I guess I dont know how to pass into the list to activate the function
[18:11:02] <geekosaur> but `listOfFuns` is not a function, it is a list of functions
[18:11:07] <int-e> Well, you need a way to operate on the list elements.
[18:11:11] <geekosaur> "the" function?

[21:32:50] <iphy> I have an AST and a traversal module (https://github.com/iphydf/hs-cimple/blob/generalised-traverse/src/Language/Cimple/TraverseAst.hs#L113) which traverses the AST forwards. is there an elegant way to support both forward and reverse traversal here?
[21:34:01] <sshine> what's reverse traversal?
[21:36:24] <iphy> e.g. in a function I have statements. forward traversal is traversing the statements in order, reverse is traversing the statements in reverse order
[21:37:15] <sshine> ohhh, so sort of a left-to-right/right-to-left or pre-/post-order
[21:37:33] <iphy> this traversal looks at every AST node once. if I number the nodes 1..n then the reverse traversal should be giving me numbers n..1
[21:37:59] <EvanR> you can use a newtype wrapper to change the Traversable instance to one that goes backwards
[21:38:41] <sshine> I was also thinking of something like Down.
[21:39:05] <iphy> I'm (mostly) not using Traversable here, because my traversal is a bit more complicated with multiple types
[21:39:11] <sshine> right.
[21:39:17] <sshine> TraverseAst in your case.
[21:39:28] <iphy>             Accessor <$> recurse name <*> recurse params <*> recurse errors
[21:39:35] <iphy> for example ^
[21:39:42] <EvanR> (a type that contains other traversable types can be made traversable)
[21:40:04] <iphy> <*> should be reversed
[21:40:20] <iphy> instead of name, params, errors, I want to traverse errors, params, name
[21:40:29] <EvanR> yeah, so either way you want a second implementation of the traversal
[21:40:48] <iphy> so a copy of the TraverseAst module?
[21:41:12] <sshine> iphy, so... the least elegant way is to define an instance TraverseAst ... (SomeWrapper (Node ...) where ...
[21:41:27] <EvanR> yeah. Of course there are generic ways to traverse any generic both ways
[21:43:06] <sshine> iphy, with a copy of your current mapFileAst instance definition, but where you explicitly do { lastThingY <- recurse lastThingX; firstThingY <- recurse firstThingX; pure (AstThing firstThingY lastThingY) }
[21:43:17] <iphy> :\
[21:43:24] <sshine> iphy, (I'm just thinking loud, I'm sure you're trying to avoid this exact thing.)

[21:44:37] <iphy> also, it would need to be named differently I think, because that only goes 1 level deep, no?
[21:44:43] <iphy> as soon as you recurse, it's forward again

[21:45:38] *** Joins: lavaman (~lavaman@98.38.249.169)
[21:45:47] <iphy> all the "Node attr lexeme" in there would have to be SomeWrapper'd
[21:46:00] <sshine> ah, yes, you'd need to wrap sub-ast elements in SomeWrapper to continue that way.
[21:46:01] <iphy> an alternative is to pass a Direction flag around and decide based on that
[21:46:13] <iphy> sshine: ah right
[21:46:22] <iphy> recurse (SomeWrapper lastThingX) etc.
[21:46:58] <EvanR> when you start to put wrappers on all nodes and subnodes, you might want to step back and factor your original structure
[21:47:02] <iphy> (define recurse as SomeWrapper . mapFileAst
[21:47:03] <iphy> )
[21:47:43] <sshine> so if your AST has that style, I forgot what it's called... like barbies: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/barbies ... and what EvanR suggests ... then you're halfway sold on recursion-schemes, I guess. it's a trade-off: manually working with your AST becomes bothersome, but writing generic traversal becomes easier.

[21:48:32] <EvanR> a bunch of these functors lets you do things in the betweens
[21:49:32] <sshine> is this HKD?
[21:49:53] <EvanR> not familiar with this jargon
[21:50:25] <iphy> ADTF?
[21:50:56] <geekosaur> HKD = higher kinded data

[21:51:42] <sshine> yeah, but it could also be another typeclass, not necessarily Functor.

[23:22:23] <EvanR> well at least you get map and fold for free
[23:22:36] <EvanR> and maybe other things in recursion schemes
[23:23:22] <EvanR> I vaguely recall being able to do traversals and handle particular node types without much code
[23:24:13] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:25:12] <EvanR> the hypertypes page claims recursion-schemes can't deal with a mutually recursive version of this with e.g. 2 types, but I'm not sure if that's the library of the whole idea can't do it
[23:25:24] <EvanR> or*

[23:26:28] <iphy> EvanR: "at least", but how do I write a parser?
[23:27:20] <iphy> data ExprF a = Add a a | Sub a a | Int Int
[23:27:56] <iphy> Add (Sub (Int 3) (Int 2)) (Int 1)

[23:29:55] *** Joins: aeka (~aeka@user/hiruji)
[23:30:03] <EvanR> what's the goal type for the parser, just Expr, or some attributes stuffs around each node
[23:30:30] <iphy> the parser doesn't add attributes, that's for later passes to add
[23:30:51] <iphy> right now the parser never produces the Attr node
[23:31:20] <EvanR> well the bare Expr is probably = Fix ExprF
[23:31:48] <EvanR> then Int 5 :: Expr
[23:34:39] <EvanR> erm

[23:40:25] <iphy> so what would these look like? https://github.com/iphydf/hs-cimple/blob/generalised-traverse/src/Language/Cimple/Parser.y#L306
[23:40:39] <EvanR> Fix (Add that that) :: Expr
[23:40:58] <iphy> but Fix is of type Fix f, not Expr?
[23:41:36] <EvanR> which are equal, type synonyms

[23:41:40] <geekosaur> above said Expr was itself Fix something

[23:42:41] <iphy> ok, so in the parser, what used to be "Add (Sub a b)" is now "Fix (Add (Fix (Sub a b)))"?
[23:43:05] <EvanR> if a parser really produces that... yeah
[23:43:30] <EvanR> basically a Fix newtype wrapper on any concrete construction
[23:44:08] <EvanR> Fix is used in libraries, but if you have other stuff going on with the `a' you could use your own newtype
[23:45:18] <iphy> ok, looks like pattern matching is going to be a pain
[23:45:36] <EvanR> which is why you want generic operations 
[23:46:15] <iphy> with HKD, I can use a type family to erase Identity from the type and make pattern matching nice
[23:46:21] <EvanR> or if it's just singling out 1 kind of node, it's just putting a Fix there too
[23:46:57] <iphy> https://github.com/TokTok/hs-tokstyle/blob/master/src/Tokstyle/Linter/LoggerCalls.hs#L23
[23:47:17] <iphy> Fix (FunctionCall (Fix (LiteralExpr _ (L _ _ "LOGGER_ASSERT"))) (_:_:Fix (LiteralExpr String) _:_)
