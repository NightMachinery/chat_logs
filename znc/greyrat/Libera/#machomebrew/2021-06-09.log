[18:07:45] <R2robot> brew edit googler
[18:08:29] <R2robot> add  , :branch => "main"
[18:08:38] <R2robot> to the line with head
[18:09:05] <R2robot> maybe you can just pass it in though..

[23:22:54] <jimmyb> If I run `brew install php@7.4` brew won't try to go outside of 7.4 will it? Like it won't try to go to 8.0?
[23:23:43] <jimmyb> I'm trying to figure it out cause I don't have php@7.4 pinned on one of my MacBooks but I did on my new M1. On the one MacBook that wasn't pinned it didn't try going to PHP 8.0 but I want to be sure I understand.
[23:39:16] <jimmyb> I should clarify my first sentence, what I mean is when I run brew update/upgrade it won't then update me to PHP 8.0.
[23:40:15] <R2robot> it shouldn't. they're 2 different formula
[23:41:18] <jimmyb> Ok, that's what I was thinking. This originally came about a while back, but I am thinking it was because I initially did a `brew install php`.
[23:41:58] <jimmyb> That explains why my Intel MacBook doesn't have php@7.4 pinned and also didn't update to PHP 8.0
[23:46:23] <R2robot> yeah, it php was at 7.4 when you first installed it, it would probably continue to upgrade as they update to the latest, but the @formula are versioned and separate
[23:47:03] <R2robot> sorry, it = if... IF php was at ...
[23:47:11] <jimmyb> Cool, thank you for clarifying R2robot ðŸ˜„
[23:47:35] <R2robot> np
