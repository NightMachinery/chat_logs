[00:00:30] <mrmonday> so I just ran fwupd through gnome's software manager on my thinkpad t470p, and now when I start up I get a windows recovery prompt... the laptop does not/has never had a windows install on it... anyone know of an existing bug report/if not where I can look for one? and, more importantly... how do I fix this?

[00:04:53] <teraflops> A live iso?
[00:05:46] <mrmonday> managed to boot from an old arch USB I had lying around, not sure what to do now though
[00:06:02] <teraflops> If you can't but you can still access to the firmware maybe flashing the firmware properly might help
[00:06:19] <mrmonday> presumably I need to mount the efi partition and do something with it, I have no idea what though
[00:06:40] <Hello71> why do i get the impression that the only problem is missing efi boot entry

[00:07:20] <mrmonday> this is arch, I installed it years ago

[09:40:54] <kevr> Have a fail2ban issue; any neckbeard nerds: here's my jail.conf http://ix.io/3ASx. The issue has to do with the [dovecot] section here. I'm using [sshd], [postfix-sasl] and [dovecot] as active jails. for sshd and postfix-sasl, it does create the iptables chain rules properly for iptables-multiport. For dovecot, it's not adding the f2b-dovecot chain to iptables at all.
[09:41:08] <kevr> Any gods spot my silly mistake, whatever it may be?
[09:41:13] <kevr> fail2ban gives zero errors, shows all three jails active.
[09:41:49] <grawlinson> permissions error on the log, maybe?
[09:41:58] <grawlinson> logging going to a file or syslog?
[09:42:08] <kevr> To a file: /var/log/dovecot.log
[09:42:18] <kevr> However
[09:42:34] <kevr> Previously I was using /var/log/mail.log for dovecot, same issue happened, and the postfix-sasl uses /var/log/mail.log and works fine.
[09:43:26] <grawlinson> is the regex working? D:
[09:43:30] <kevr> yeah, i just 644'd it and it didn't change anything.
[09:43:49] <kevr> grawlinson: So, before we go down that road, shouldnt the chain be created regardless of the actual regex matching?
[09:44:06] <grawlinson> it's been a while since i've mucked around with fail2ban, but probably
[09:44:14] <kevr> So, when it matches a bad one, it adds that drop/reject rule to the chain in question
[09:44:23] <kevr> for the other two, i have f2b-sshd chain, f2b-postfix-sasl
[09:44:37] <kevr> Hm..

[10:54:42] <phrik> Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
[10:55:28] <ThomasD13> Hey guys, good morning. I have some issues to install timeshift. I wanna do a backup, before I do a 2 month system upgrade. Can someone help me on that?
[10:56:18] <Jiogen> No fuckups from me today... surprisingly given that I migrated my archinstall from a unencrypted part to a LUKUS vol
[10:56:28] <ThomasD13> I cloned the git-repo of timeshift, switched to archlinux directory and try to build the package with "makepkg - si"
[10:56:43] <NetSysFire> you want makepkg -si
[10:56:45] <NetSysFire> without the space
[10:57:10] <ThomasD13> NetSysFire, sorry for the typo. I did makepkg -si
[10:57:26] <ThomasD13> At the end of the build prozess, it always failed with "install: cannot stat '../debian/timeshift.appdata.xml': No such file or directory"

[11:25:25] <ayekat> ThomasD13: potentially - but the issue is somewhere within their build scripts and/or makefiles
[11:25:45] <ayekat> and if they write makefiles and build scripts like they write PKGBUILDs...

[18:02:05] <Gagis> pulseaudio has a module module-noise-cancel

[18:08:04] <BrainDamage> I know how to do it in jack or pa, but not sure if pipewire has some special way to do it
[18:08:23] <BrainDamage> white noise by definition also covers human vocal range
[18:08:30] <BrainDamage> but it extends past it

[18:17:26] <MacGyver> kib: If you want to be fancy about it, record some audio of the fan, then do a spectral analysis of that.

[21:04:07] <centrix> I realized that the old kenel was at the EFI partition, but the new one at /boot.
[21:04:16] <heat> ah
[21:04:44] <centrix> For the mismatch of the kernels it could not mount /boot as it did not load the ext4 module.
[21:04:58] *** Quits: Dark (~dark@user/dark) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:05:06] <heat> well, theoretically a very common approach is to keep /boot as a separate partition (or as a part of the root partition) and mount the ESP at /boot/efi

[21:08:02] <heat> centrix: if you're using the efistub you can mount the esp directly into /boot and then kernel updates directly update the kernel
[21:08:23] *** Quits: Dark (~dark@user/dark) (Client Quit)

[21:19:01] *** Joins: fred (fred@user/fred)
[21:19:09] <centrix> So I gues the resume is that I have to mount the EFI partition to /boot intead the boot partition to /boot.
[21:19:21] <centrix> If I want to boot using the EFI system.
[21:19:56] <heat> yes
[21:20:04] <centrix> That way pacman installs kernel onto the correct partition.

[21:23:54] <heat> possibly but that's redundant anyway
[21:24:01] <heat> why would you want to do that?

[23:26:30] <Mano> Hey, I've been gaming on a VM for a few months now, and since yesterday, the host running arch is crashing after 5 to 30min of playing a game (tried apex and new world). I'm getting some EXT4-FS error, and because of that my drive switches to read-only which means no journald logs... I checked the drive with fsck, smartctl and badblocks and
[23:26:30] <Mano> everything seems fine. As I can't really find a way to replicate the crash without the VM running I'm not sure if it's an issue still with my ssd or a software issue. I'm kind of lost as to what the next steps of troubleshooting are, anyone able to help?
[23:26:34] <nova> Everyone said to format the USB as fat32. I did. When I try to "use" unetbootin with the iso "on" the USB (/dev/sda - yes that's my USB), it complains it's unmounted. So, I mount it as a user (with sudo mount -o gid=users,fmask=113,dmask=002 /dev/sda /mnt/usb --> I used /dev/sda because there is no /dev/sda1 but I suspect maybe there should be? --> the reason I mount it like this is because sudo
[23:26:35] <nova> mount /dev/sda /mnt/usb caused unetbootin to block for a really long time (it seemed frozen?)). Then I rebooted into the USB and got the error. The windows bull**** started up, but then when I clicked "install" it gave me the error

[23:46:05] <rassawyer> I am assuming he is trying to make a Windows bootable usb *from* arch, so, maybe kinda notArch, but not terribly...
[23:46:37] <rassawyer> also, not to be pedantic, but ! === not, so !notArch would be not notArch...?
[23:46:43] <jonathon> oh, you format the USB as exfat and copy the files over from the windows image... https://medium.com/techtalkers/make-a-windows-bootable-usb-on-linux-without-woeusb-11b930ec1cff

[23:48:38] <jonathon> one of them has _got_ to work :)
[23:49:11] <rassawyer> I am reasonably familiar with the terms... my point stands, afaik he is endeavouring to use Arch to accomplish a task, which makes it Arch related.

[23:51:05] <rassawyer> I digress. He has tried numerous methods, and came here when they were unsuccessful
[23:51:35] <jonathon> sure, and i gave two methods that will work.

[23:53:13] <hiya> I don't know if I am doing off-topic, but today, I got insulted by an opensource guy who works with .net framework, he told me he respects my love for Libre stuff. He says, he respects that he uses I did pureOS, debian with main repo only, trisquel and stuff. But I could never do libreboot, so I am not half baked product. I don't even use Linux properly. I have btrfs but I won't use snapshots, I don't even backup my stuff with scripts, I just copy/paste. 
[23:53:13] <hiya> Basically after Windows with WSL, I am not creating useless pain for me. As I am not real pro like some of your guys who help me when arch won't boot. [I mean I also research and fix my own things but still, nothing without you]. I am also thinking after being a member of FSF.org etc, and leaving Windows when 7 just came out. Should I go back? As I am not a real GNU/Linux guy.
[23:53:40] <jonathon> ...
[23:53:48] <hiya> I am half baked product*

[23:54:09] <Mano> Hey, I've been gaming on a VM for a few months now, and since yesterday, the host running arch is crashing after 5 to 30min of playing a game (tried apex and new world). I'm getting some EXT4-FS error, and because of that my drive switches to read-only which means no journald logs... I checked the drive with fsck, smartctl and badblocks and
[23:54:09] <Mano> everything seems fine. As I can't really find a way to replicate the crash without the VM running I'm not sure if it's an issue still with my ssd or a software issue. I'm kind of lost as to what the next steps of troubleshooting are, anyone able to help?
[23:54:15] <hiya> jonathon: I am so sad man, I am not a real pro :( 
[23:54:51] <jonathon> Mano: possibly overheating, check your temperatures?

[23:55:56] <Mano> CPU always under 70, GPU under 80
[23:56:09] <jonathon> what about disk temperature?
[23:56:18] <Mano> I did a windows update, and updated some packages on arch
