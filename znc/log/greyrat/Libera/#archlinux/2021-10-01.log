[00:13:25] <maztheman> (i think)

[00:22:38] <Namarrgon> it depends on the hardware. not everything is supported by the kernel and even if it is supported it's sometimes not detected (correctly) by sensors-detect

[00:24:45] <heythere221> I can change fan RPM on windows 10 tho
[00:25:22] <Namarrgon> if it's possible from windows then it's theoretically possible from linux

[09:15:18] <mohan43u> I thought emacs UI in gnome should be able to work automatically with whatever input method gnome uses.
[09:16:26] <ash_worksi> I'm looking for a simple program that can time activity. Basically something that works like a screensaver, except instead of changing the screen, just log the timer (I presume there must be a timer to make a screensaver work)

[09:22:31] <jmcantrell> Anyone know how I can get the system to recognize a change in the disk size after resizing it in virtualbox?
[09:22:40] <ash_worksi> I don't care about the screensaver functionality whatsoever, I just want something that listens the the same events and logs the time
[09:22:46] <Cork> ash_worksi: that is dbus events it doesn't have to actually start a screensaver
[09:22:59] <ash_worksi> (ideally, an active interval, but I'll make due with just timestamps)

[09:58:18] <ash_m> So the dbus-monitor thing is a great idea, but it seems like the screen saver has to actually perform an action to trigger any kind of effect. I basically just want to know/track how long the computer is (not) idle
[09:59:25] <ash_m> So, basically print an "activity detected" timestamp and "idle detected" timestamp

[11:49:24] <DeeJayh__> So arch on my proliant server just lost networking as worst, or crashed at best. I didn't have a monitor handy to see what was going on locally, but ssh dropped and it dropped from the list of active leases on my router. I eventually hard reset it and it came back up fine, no issues. I dont see anything red timestamped in the journalctl prior to the boot hash. I'm wondering what else I could do to try to identify what happened?

[14:18:09] <Foxboron> But I didn't see this. When I said I could package this and queried upstream what they'd prefer they went: "lets merge compose and compose-switch, we know when the compose binary is used as a plugin"

[16:46:52] <Namarrgon> they shipped the drama, just not all of it
[16:47:44] <rkleef> It seems they shipped 9 timezones worth of drama, instead of 30+, according to LWN.

[16:49:21] <th0rne> Is there something like pdfarranger, but simple and cli? Like: 'some_program --rotate 180 --in-place my.pdf' or something like this?
[16:49:33] <Gagis> whats the timezone drama all about?
[16:50:20] <Gagis> th0rne, pdftools can do a lot. I can't rememember just what all tricks it can do but it sorted my needs a couple of years back when I had to compile a bunch of pdf files into one
[16:50:31] <th0rne> I'll check it out, cheers.
[16:50:55] <rkleef> Gagis: There was a proposal from the tzdb maintainer to merge 30+ timezones. He wanted to merge the zones that were equal post-1970. This would lose historical data for those timezones that would become links to their actual timezones.
[16:51:22] <Gagis> gotcha
[16:51:45] <rkleef> And it seems that all those timezones were in europe and northern(ish) america.

[18:45:05] <th0rne> Main issue is that I have a script that starts the bridge in the background if it's not already running, and then starts neomutt, but it just doesn't let me in half the time. Then I have to pkill the bridge and start the gui version and it tells me that I'm already logged in and then it works, but these are some pretty annoying extra steps that I have to do pretty often.

[21:01:41] <micw> Is maybe one of the xorg-server maintainers available here? I'm heavily testing a small patch that allows to set multiple virtual monitors at one output. This enables proper splitting of ultra-wide monitors on many window managers
[21:02:15] *** bugger is now known as demonicmaniac
[21:02:49] <teraflops> micw: is that patch applied upstream?
[21:03:11] <micw> no, unfortunately not
[21:03:22] <micw> otherwise I'd simply upgrade
[21:03:48] <micw> the patch is trivial. when adding more than one monitor, xorg-server checks that the "output" is only used once
[21:03:49] <DilithiumNO3> kuhilas: you can get the size of a file without downloading anything, with wget --spider or curl --head
[21:03:57] <micw> so the other monitors needs to be added as "none" output

If one wishes to install a tool that they like locally in home directory (given they don't have sudo permissions), all they can do is download the source code and compile it themselves. That means finding and compiling all

[23:03:39] <gtlsgamr> Hello. Internet works fine on my machine, and it was working fine until an hour ago, where some games just cannot detect the internet. Red dead online on steam and miencraft cannot detect internet. Other than that everything works perfectly. I checked systemd-resolved service, and this is the output for it and looks fine. Do any of you have this happen to you or know how to go about solving this?
