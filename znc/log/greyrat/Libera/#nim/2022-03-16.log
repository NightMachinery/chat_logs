[19:44:08] <daanb> Hello, its me again. I found a way to fix the GC-Safe issue by moving all variables that where global to the arguments of the function. However what do we need todo with external functions like imports etc
[19:52:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> external imported functions are gc safe unless they also depend on globals
[20:01:46] <daanb> One of the imported functions imports some constants. from another file
[20:03:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> constants are fine, if theyre `const` and not otherwise i think
[20:07:32] <daanb> Theyre defined as `let` but could be changed to `const` cause theyre never changed and not defined in code.

[20:29:19] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i can load vsts, modify them, then input tracks and output them

[21:54:58] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> python has isupper() that sounds like Apple made some kind of shiny soup
[22:00:54] <daanb> I want to add to the error, file contents isn't being read currently. The code only checks if a file exists.

[23:17:30] <FromDiscord> <Daan Breur> Its @d4rckh's. I just helped him with some stuff. Its a fuzzer↵https://github.com/d4rckh/vaf
[23:31:15] <FromDiscord> <tandy> cool!↵(@Daan Breur)
[23:33:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Daan Breur "I found the issue": m items is not a field, it’s an iterator; hence you cannot echo it
[23:34:13] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It’s an inline iterator specifically, meaning it is not usable outside of a for loop or a macro (that in turn makes a for loop, or whatever else like untyped or so)
[23:34:35] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Removing the echo should make it work
[23:34:59] <FromDiscord> <Daan Breur> In reply to @Daan Breur "So i finally fixed": Ah I thought it was why I kept getting that error here
[23:35:18] <FromDiscord> <Daan Breur> I added the echo to check its content
