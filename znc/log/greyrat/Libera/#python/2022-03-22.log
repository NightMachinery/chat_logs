[03:43:56] <NeilRG> ELFrederich, yeah, I need to think about this some more.  I should probably break inheritance like meejah suggested
[03:44:11] <NeilRG> inheritance for convenience seems to be a code smell most of the time
[03:44:12] <BrenBarn> it seems weird to have Y inherit from X but then want Y to not have the stuff that X has
[03:44:13] <BrenBarn> that's kind of the point of inheriting
[03:44:15] <NeilRG> easy trap to fall into

[03:51:41] <NeilRG> vaaqif, use sum instead of adding the chars, and using str.join instead of adding the rows
[03:51:54] <KirkMcDonald> sum() does not work with strings.

[03:52:45] <NeilRG> KirkMcDonald, oh yeah, they removed that, "".join() is simpler then
[03:53:15] <KirkMcDonald> Eh, it's about the same.
[03:54:34] <NeilRG> return "\n".join("".join(for item in row) for row in self.grid) seems simpler to me
[03:54:50] <NeilRG> return "\n".join("".join(row) for row in self.grid) seems simpler to me
[03:55:03] <KirkMcDonald> That's going to miss a newline on the end.
[03:55:13] <NeilRG> okay, so + "\n"
[03:55:22] <NeilRG> not sure repr should have that though
[03:55:30] <NeilRG> usually repr doesn't include a newline
[03:55:51] <vaaqif> Thank you for the advice. For the grid because there is only one scrabble board, I thought I should include it into the class variable. Is there a reason to include it in the init instead?

But I'm not sure the best way to get the player to interact with the board. Should I pass in the instance of the board class or something else? https://bpa.st/6SFQ

[08:02:09] <deltab> 08:40:51 < jinsun__> mypy has a stupid limitation though, if you don't take any parameters in __init__ and you run strict mode then it will ask you to annotate the return type as None
[08:02:51] *** Joins: raym (~raym@user/raym)
[08:03:20] <Indecisive> That's a minor sin at most, as long as there's a way for it to not freak out at me importing libraries it doesn't have type records on.

[08:03:30] <SnoopJ> Indecisive, mypy's --strict is a short way to turn on a bunch of individual options. It makes the tool much pickier about the source you give it, i.e. it will complain about unannotated functions instead of just letting them sail through without much benefit from static analysis.
[08:04:32] <SnoopJ> you can definitely squelch complaints about missing type information per-library, I've done this for some generated (in a way that makes it hard to get annotations) bindings before
[08:04:51] *** Joins: relight (~relight@user/relight)
[08:05:02] <SnoopJ> and also just some stuff in the scipy stack that was missing type info at the time of that project, looking at its mypy.ini
[08:05:09] <Indecisive> And is mypy automatically ran as part of the python interpreter process, or is it something you run once when you are done editing your file, have it print something like "yeah ur good" into your terminal, and THEN you just run python
[08:05:14] <Indecisive> ?
[08:05:22] <Indecisive> (Forgot my question mark)
[08:05:23] <SnoopJ> It's a separate tool
[08:05:59] <SnoopJ> There are a variety of ways to make tools like this (there are others) part of a workflow that lets you regularly check your work, though
[08:06:19] <Indecisive> Does it do anything to manipulate the python source files itself (like typescript), or does it automatically make changes to the source (like a linter), or does it just send a pass/fail message?

[08:07:35] <SnoopJ> Mypy just issues an error report (or warnings, or a friendly green "success!") for you
[08:08:09] <SnoopJ> There are other tools that perform some of this functionality, though. If you want a slightly shorter feedback loop, Pylance is a tool that can do static analysis and also integrates well into IDEs (VS Code in particular)

[10:39:52] <BrenBarn> the way you should do it is read it in, do whatever manipulations you want, and then use `.to_csv` to write it out to a file again (the same file if you like)

[12:12:40] <ccapndave> Ok
[12:12:44] <jinsun__> True and False is False and False == 0
[12:13:12] <ccapndave> No, but `True and False` actually shows `0` as the output in Jupyter
[12:13:23] <jinsun__> (that's actally valid python code too :D)
[12:13:33] <han-solo> 0 ?
[12:13:34] <BrenBarn> so then try `[re.search('battery', sensor) and sensor not in ignore_sensors for sensor in state_names]

[12:14:12] <ccapndave> I'll just start a new notebook
[12:14:12] <sudomann> can `str(foo)` produce the error ` nonetype is not iterable`?
[12:14:19] <supakeen> Yes.
[12:14:25] *** Quits: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:14:26] <supakeen> As far as I know it can.
[12:14:28] <jinsun__> yeah I was writing english and then I noticed it is valid python also after typing it
[12:15:00] <supakeen> sudomann: It really depends on what the `__str__` of `foo` is.
[12:15:00] <sudomann> Ooookay small progress here, thank you
[12:15:01] <ccapndave> BrenBarn: That returns `[0, 0, True, True]`
[12:15:05] <supakeen> So it can be anything 🙂
[12:15:17] <BrenBarn> so it seems like something weird is going on with the booleans
[12:15:23] <ccapndave> It does
[12:15:33] <BrenBarn> try `type(True and False)`
[12:15:55] <ccapndave> `<class 'int'>`
[12:16:10] <sudomann> The system I am trying to debug is so unforgiving in its setup, I cant even get a usable trace for exceptions
[12:16:15] <ccapndave> It should be <class 'bool'>, eh?
[12:16:16] <supakeen> Did you, at some point, redefine `False` in this session or is this default ipython weirdness?
[12:16:28] <ccapndave> I'm using a custom kernel for Home Assistant
[12:16:30] <BrenBarn> yeah, it should be bool
[12:16:33] <ccapndave> Which is apparently a bit buggy
[12:16:39] <BrenBarn> I don't know what this HASS thing is, but, like is it really Python?
[12:16:39] <ccapndave> https://github.com/craigbarratt/hass-pyscript-jupyter
[12:16:55] <BrenBarn> that doesn't really explain what it is on the backend though
[12:16:57] <supakeen> ccapndave: what is `type(False)` then?
[12:17:03] <jinsun__> can't redefine True and False even in ipython at least with the default kernel
[12:17:04] <han-solo> supakeen: though can it ? i am getting only type error for those
[12:17:23] <han-solo> `class X:..def __str__(self):....return None` or return anything non stringy
[12:17:24] <supakeen> han-solo: you can do anything you want in `__str__`.
[12:17:32] <ccapndave> type(False) is <class 'bool'>
[12:17:46] <supakeen> `def str(self): for x in None: ...

[12:17:57] <ccapndave> type(True and True) == <class 'bool'>
[12:17:58] <han-solo> make sense
[12:18:00] <BrenBarn> like is "pyscript" actually *Python*, or is it some kind of thing that is mapping to some kind of Python emulator or something
[12:18:02] <supakeen> Maybe a bit tricky.
[12:18:10] <supakeen> ccapndave: Exceedingly weird.
[12:19:00] *** Quits: jmd` (~user@de.cellform.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:19:31] <jinsun__> kinda feels like a buggy python emulator, probably written in JS
[12:19:38] <BrenBarn> yeah, that's what I'm thinking
[12:19:51] <BrenBarn> it's translating Python to something else and it's not doing it right
[12:20:09] <supakeen> Anyways, I missed the initial problem this is causing, `0` is likely still Falsey 🙂
[12:20:12] <BrenBarn> out of curiosity try `bool(0)`
[12:20:20] <BrenBarn> yeah
[12:21:26] <ccapndave> bool(0) is False
[12:21:31] <BrenBarn> hmmm
[12:21:52] <BrenBarn> so try doing your list comprehension with `if False` and then `if True and False` as the condition
[12:21:55] <ccapndave> So it actually looks like this custom kernel is implementing a parser and evaluator
[12:22:01] <ccapndave> I have no idea why but I'm sure there is a good reason

[12:33:16] <ccapndave> Thanks everyone for your help
[12:33:33] <csm3105> hi guys, regarding this tutorial https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/#create-a-sessionlocal-class in the section where cerates the local session class they pass as parameter autocommit and autoflush
[12:33:48] <csm3105> I took a look at it, and if I understand correctly, flush() communicates a series of operations to the database (like insert, update or delete)
[12:33:54] <BrenBarn> It seems there are some other issues related to emulation failures
[12:33:54] <BrenBarn> https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/issues/263
[12:34:03] <BrenBarn> https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/issues/236
[12:34:03] <jinsun__> also weird that it is written in python, if it was JS or some other language it would have made more sense, like python runtime itself is not available wherever it is supposed to run
[12:34:13] *** Quits: grooverman_ (~grooverma@152.250.149.217) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:34:29] <csm3105> And the database keeps them as pending operations in a transaction, so these changes are not visible until it receives a commit...correct me if I'v sais something wrong please
[12:34:49] <csm3105> I still don't understand why in this example both values are set to false, according to the sqlalchemy documentation the default value is true
[12:34:58] <supakeen> csm3105: It's honestly close enough.
[12:35:19] <ccapndave> jinsun__ It runs in home assistant which itself is written in Python
[12:35:39] <ccapndave> So the platform (which can be anything but is usually a Rasberry Pi) can definitely run it
[12:35:40] <BrenBarn> yeah it's weird that it seems to be Python implemented in Python
[12:35:48] <ccapndave> Very weird
[12:35:53] <BrenBarn> I also see this buried in the documentation: https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#language-limitations
[12:36:12] <csm3105> what would it change in the behavior of the database to do it one way or the other?
[12:36:35] <supakeen> csm3105: Specifically, flushing means 'put all changes in objects in the current session into the database transaction', and committing means, well, committing.
[12:36:51] <supakeen> Nothing much, a commit already flushes.
[12:37:09] <supakeen> There's some tidbits about shared sessions (don't do that).
[12:37:13] <ccapndave> BrenBarn: So maybe the whole thing is to make an async version of Python?

[13:50:21] <gulzar> Hi. I have a string with 4 values separated with '|' and if another group is present in the same string , it is separated with '---' and again 4 values with '|'.  simply %4==0.  I need to separate this into tuple/list of lists OR put them into dict with keys, either way. Each containing 4 elements. looks like this https://bpa.st/TFTQ  . Any
[13:50:21] <gulzar> ideas please

[19:35:48] <mav`rik> wyre: duplication for different purposes though. The pydantic schema is used for parsing and normalisation, the sqla one for describing the backend model. I'm not 100% sure I'd choose to tie the two together, otherwise your external model (as exposed to a REST client) would be the same as the internal one. That feels weird to me

[20:03:24] <SnoopJ> wyre, in this context, a schema is a document that describes the structure of other documents that comply with the schema. So you can *create* a data model in Pydantic and create a schema from your model which other tools can use to do their own validation/etc.

[20:25:58] <stewie925> hey guys, I am running python with lots of pandas processing and its getting KILLED - I am running the python script on a linux server on Windows machine.
[20:26:10] <twb> stewie925: is it OOMing?
[20:26:12] <sco1> What does that mean
[20:26:22] <The-Compiler> "out of memory"-ing
[20:26:30] <stewie925> twb:  it looks like it, yes
[20:26:34] <sco1> I meant "killed", not OOM
[20:26:58] <stewie925> but there is no warning whatsoever -it just issues the word KILLED
[20:27:00] <twb> stewie925: OK, so is it legitimately needing lots of memory, or is it leaking
[20:27:01] <SnoopJ> stewie925, what is your question?

[20:28:18] <twb> (I have no idea how to do this in pandas stuff; I'm just speaking generically)
[20:28:19] <rama> Is there a preferred way to assert that only a set of keys are present in a dictionary, and there are no other entries?
[20:28:54] <twb> rama: I would say something like if set(expected_keys) != set(mydict.keys()): raise RuntimeError('...', mydict)
[20:29:30] <twb> There is an actual "assert" keyword, but people tell me not to use it because then dumb people will compile it out
[20:29:56] <mav`rik> twb: you don't need the call to `.keys()` there

[20:36:06] <stewie925> I already changed my python pandas SELECT statements to include column names, not just dump the whole table to the dataframe  to avoid the memory issue
[20:36:35] <SnoopJ> stewie925, I have encountered this sort of problem on Linux, the fix was mostly "make the program use less memory." There are *some* changes you can make at the system level to make the OOM killer a little nicer, but the options are not great: https://lwn.net/Articles/317814/
[20:36:56] <mav`rik> stewie925: the way to usually solve something like this is to profile your memory usage, and or consider how/where you might be creating a lot of objects
[20:37:18] <stewie925> SnoopJ thank you

[20:37:33] <stewie925> mav`rik thank you
[20:38:09] <SnoopJ> resource.setrlimit() with RLIMIT_AS can also be handy to limit the size of a program's address space. It won't apply to all programs, but when it does work, it'll raise MemoryError when the address space becomes "too large" https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.setrlimit
[20:39:01] <SnoopJ> kind of a crude solution, but unfortunately the OOM killer is just not very configurable; if it gets invoked, things are going to get messy before returning to user space :(

[20:40:06] <stewie925> appreciate your input SnoopJ
[20:40:11] <mav`rik> SnoopJ: at least with a MemoryError you're likely to get a traceback where the allocation occurs, which is a benefit
[20:40:35] <SnoopJ> mav`rik, yes, but unfortunately *any* alloc might be the one that sends you over the limit, so it's less useful than you might expect
[20:41:11] <SnoopJ> it can be handy if it's absolutely unacceptable to just kill the program (and drop live connections/etc.) though
[20:41:18] <twb> stewie925: another thing nobody has mentioned yet (AFAICT)
