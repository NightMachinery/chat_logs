[06:10:23] <jan6> clickbaity title, but good video, is basically uses the classic lil sonar sensors, similar to what comes with arduino kits and such, and explains how beam forming works, and then shows how with an esp32, and like 8 of those ultrasonic thingies, you can actually have a relatively decent low-range detection kit that can "see" where things are, at like, ~1 fps or such
[06:11:08] *** Joins: HaMsTeRs (~Thunderbi@210.3.213.4)
[06:11:10] <jan6> of course, those don't really detect that far, so you're limited to something like, 10-20 cm or such, and the farther the thing is, the longer it takes to detect it, and it's very low resolution...but still

[21:55:34] <jan6> in the video, he even overlays it over camera image, to show, how it's imperfect and not that fast, but still pretty cool, and could totally be used for a board game or such
