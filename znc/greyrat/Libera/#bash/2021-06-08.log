[00:18:33] <yitz> Usual approach is to `printf` a result and use $()
[00:18:35] <greycat> storing the output value in a global variable works well in many cases

[03:40:02] <ash_worksi> yeah, I mean that's kind of the conundrum in it-of-itself; like, if I do something like `mycommand 116852211 'some' 'other' 'stuff'` and I want to replace the number with a different one, to use history expansion I have to type the number out again
[03:41:08] <ash_worksi> I mean, if I'm concatenating history expansions, it might feel more awkward then just pressing the up-arrow key, moving back to the number deleting it and re-entering

[12:08:42] <greybot> The =~ operator of [[ evaluates the left hand string against the right hand ERE (see <ere>, <regex>). After a successful match, the BASH_REMATCH array contains the matched string and subexpressions (if any). Any quoted characters in the ERE become literal.

[12:16:15] <geirha> it's a bit annoying that the variable name, BASH_REMATCH, is so long, so that's one case where namerefs are nice. declare -n m=BASH_REMATCH; and then one can use "${m[1]}" instead of "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
[12:20:39] <Soliton> alguien: note that back references are a regex thing. (BRE even, like \(foo\)bar\1) you're talking about some operation that references a capture group of a regex. which is not something solely related to regex. regex just does the match what you do with some capture group is none of its business.

[13:38:30] <woky> I said dialog but I mean the "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? " when the host is not in known_hosts

[13:42:12] <geirha> Hm. Right. I kind-of has to do that, since you might be using it in the middle of a pipeline  somecmd | ssh ... > foo.txt  Yet it still needs confirmation
[13:43:16] <woky> Yep, I understand the reason. This is just an example program that's tty aware. But when run with e.g. sshpass, it is misled into thinking it's not running in tty and just exists with 6.

[13:46:17] <geirha> Not sure how to do that portably. For ssh specifically, you would of course just provide the relevant options with e.g. -o. For others, I guess setsid(1) would work, but that's not a standard command
[13:47:30] <woky> geirha, awesome, setsid -w seems to be exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!

[13:56:02] <woky> I was wrong about exit code and no output. That seems to be sshpass specific behavior. With nohup, it actually still uses tty for output. However, with setsid it behaves as described in ssh(1), i.e. on ssh error it exists with 255 (and prints to stderr).
[13:57:01] <Soliton> sshpass wouldn't work without controlling terminal.
[13:57:22] <woky> Isn't non-interactivity the point of sshpass?
[13:57:58] <Soliton> the point is to fake a terminal to ssh.
[13:58:38] <Soliton> ssh cannot possibly know if that fake terminal is use non-interactively.
[14:00:04] <woky> Sshpass also somehow detects that ssh is asking to confirm unknown host, and it that case just exists with code 6.
[14:01:38] <Soliton> presumably sshpass doesn't just blindly input the passwrod but checks what ssh writes first.

[19:34:54] <tsujp> you know `su - someuser` doesn't inherit the previous users env vars, how do you also pass flags? Like, is `su -l someuser` the same as the flag `l` and `-` or is it `su - -l someuser`?

[19:51:09] <twkm> passing things to what su runs might be done via -c, provided your su -c specifies the command to run otherwise after the username is likely.
[19:51:49] <tsujp> ive heard just now that if `su` isn't attached to a terminal doing `su - myuser` will change to the user, find it has nothing to run, then the execution context goes back to the previous user
[19:52:05] <tsujp> this means `su` has to be run in an interactive-shell (which requires a terminal) or be used with the `-c` flag right?

[20:28:04] <tsujp> holy smokes that first example is nutty
[20:28:06] <tsujp> with let i++
[20:28:09] <twkm> pipefail can be surprising, e.g., in ''lotsofoutput | grep -q pattern'' grep might exit as soon as the pattern is detected which can cause the source to abort resulting in a failure when in fact it should be success since the pattern was found.
[20:28:46] <tsujp> the exit code of an assignment makes sense, but this `let i++` returns the exit code `1` if `i` is 0...
[20:28:47] <tsujp> why...
[20:31:14] <twkm> it is supposed to ... from ''man bash'': If the last arg evaluates to 0, let returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.
[20:31:29] <tsujp> WHAT
[20:31:33] <tsujp> why is that a thing??
[20:31:41] <e36freak> because it's equivalent to ((i++))
[20:31:45] <twkm> it can be useful.
[20:31:47] <e36freak> and (( is used to test expressions as well
[20:32:17] <tsujp> hang on `let` is used for arithmetic operation right, why does `let i++` where that evaluates as `let 1` mean you return status code `1` meaning failure

[20:33:24] <tsujp> right sorry, why does `let 0` mean return 1
[20:33:30] <tsujp> status code `1` means failure
[20:33:34] <tsujp> but nothing about `let 0` _fails_
[20:33:37] <e36freak> tsujp: what d oyou expect ((0)) to do?
[20:34:02] <e36freak> how else are you supposed to test arithmetic stuff?
[20:34:12] *** Joins: flommi (~flommi@puck942.startdedicated.de)
[20:34:13] <twkm> because it is defined that way, which is the say the c way, 0 is false a non-zero is true.
[20:34:57] <tsujp> `((0))` I would expect to evaluate to `0` because the single statement is `0` and return `0` as in success
[20:35:41] <tsujp> 0 and 1 has nothing to do with false and true here IIRC, `return 0;` means success
[20:35:45] <tsujp> non-zero return means failure
[20:36:05] <tsujp> why the return code of the command "$?" that executed successfully is `1` is..?
[20:36:13] <tsujp> I get that it's equivalent to (()) but _why_

[20:36:23] <tsujp> That seems arbitrary

[20:41:30] <tsujp> I don't think that's a correct statement. That is the case for booleans, but the return code `0` in C is very specifically defined as EXIT_SUCCESS

[20:42:02] <twkm> sigh.
[20:42:04] <tsujp> let 0; "$?" prints `1`
[20:42:22] <e36freak> tsujp: this is how conditional commands work
[20:42:35] <e36freak> what do you think [ or [[ does? how does if know if it evaluates to true or false?
[20:42:37] <twkm> because 0 is false according to c, so it results in an exit status of 1.
[20:43:06] *** Quits: ayustae (Thunderbir@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ayustae) (Quit: ayustae)
[20:43:07] <tsujp> are you saying `let` passes the literal evaluation of its arguments to `return` within its source?

[20:43:55] <tsujp> e36freak its my understanding $? which is the return-code of the command or built-in is used in all cases
[20:44:51] <tsujp> I still don't understand what you're saying twkm, `let i++` returns the value of `i` immediately? (why would that be the case / how is that possible if it also successfully adds 1) because the only thing I can think of relating to what you're saying is `return first_argument;` in the source for `let`
[20:45:00] <tsujp> I don't see where or why "because 0 is false according to c, so it results in an exit status of 1." comes into it
[20:45:08] <twkm> oh well.
[20:46:02] <tsujp> Rightio, the onice is on you to explain that I feel. We're talking about bash built-ins here and the statement about `return` values regarding C is incorrect.

[20:53:48] <tsujp> I understand that too, but that doesn't mean that when we know better in the future we can change things
[20:54:04] <tsujp> What does maths have to do with that not being changed? Breaking changes not allowed?
[20:54:14] <twkm> not generally.
[20:54:37] <tsujp> I find that also.. unpleasant. Why if they can be scoped to new major releases? E.g. `bash 6` for instance?
[20:54:53] <uplime> considering how backwards compatible it has to be with posix sh, breaking changes aren't usually wanted
[20:55:10] <tsujp> Aren't `[[`, `((`, and `let` all bash built-ins?
[20:55:24] <uplime> the first two are keywords, not builtins
[20:55:24] <twkm> they must be.
[20:55:43] <yitz> Being builtin/keywords doesn't mean they can change behavior without breaking things
[20:55:45] <tsujp> Sorry let me backtrack, what does this behavour have to do with POSIX or is this behaviour part of the POSIX spec?
[20:56:02] <twkm> let is not posix.
[20:56:33] <tsujp> Right so if this doesn't affect POSIX compatibility then...? It's a Bash-only thing

[21:42:58] *** Joins: nobody_ (~nobody@host-87-9-175-157.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[21:43:07] <fresheyeball> I could fail to hear the process exit because the spawn is sync
[21:43:15] <fresheyeball> and so it might have exited before I setup listening
[21:43:16] <twkm> you can't even be sure that pid won't reappear even though you haven't wait'd on it.
[21:43:17] <fresheyeball> for example
[21:43:27] <fresheyeball> I am using `wait`
[21:43:32] <twkm> immaterial.
[21:43:36] <fresheyeball> ok

[21:45:02] <koala_man> if you fail to detect the process exiting, that's a problem with your code and not with bash or concurrency
[21:45:26] <Friithian> so, what are you actually trying to do? or is this all theoretical?
[21:47:03] *** Joins: JohnML (~JohnML@ip-37-201-129-30.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de)
[21:47:24] <twkm> perhaps something like ''rm -f /some/pipe; foo & while sleep 1; do [[ -p /some/pipe ]] && break; done'' would be possible.

[21:56:37] <fresheyeball> this is the script in question
[21:57:02] <fresheyeball> what I am trying to do, is to ensure that if any of these processes exit 1, the script fails (this is needed for CI)

[22:00:01] <koala_man> fresheyeball: 'wait' will correctly return the exit code for the pid even if it's already exited
[22:00:20] <fresheyeball> koala_man: ok, so it's proably fine as is then

[23:01:12] <greybot> DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
