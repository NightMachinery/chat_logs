[00:10:32] <riv> what are the disadvantages of doing encrypted chat over IRC with a client only plugin?
[00:11:45] <rqsd> You have no guarantee about encryption+authentication across the entire network, so you can already assume passive eavesdropping and thus metadata leakage. Assuming things in common use, this means people involved + message length.
[00:12:16] <rqsd> (Unless you use a private IRC network=server, but then the whole threat model simplifies)
[00:13:08] <riv> hmm
[00:13:08] <rqsd> Additionally, none of these client plugins that I'm aware of have been audited or even written by anything resembling a cryptographer. If you're aware of any, I'd like to know; the best I'm aware of is the things built around libotr
[00:13:19] <rqsd> Oh and timing of messages of course
[00:13:43] <riv> i wonder how this would compare with something like riot/matrix
[00:13:45] <rqsd> This means you can do network correlation if your ISP is hostile and infer that message at T and HTTPS connection at T+1, they're probably correlated
[00:14:12] <riv> i suppose that message length is easy to cover
[00:14:19] <riv> just pad everything to 512

[00:14:31] <rqsd> Furthermore, you have the usual problem that you cannot verify the counterparty until you've exchanged keys out of band via a trusted channel
[00:14:39] *** Joins: deusexbeer (~hedeo@37-146-228-227.broadband.corbina.ru)
[00:15:22] <rqsd> As for Riot/Matrix, I haven't the slightest idea, I've never had reason to care about either, neither on a protocol level nor on an implementation level
[00:16:08] <rqsd> Additionally, most clients perform automatic client-side logging of some kind, so most IRC clients will then store the messages indefinitely in plaintext, so you now also have a data at rest issue
[00:16:38] <rqsd> (Unless you get a *lot* of discipline from everyone involved, which you can neither verify and requires arcane per-client knowledge and may possibly only be a global "turn off logging" switch)
[00:16:55] <riv> rqsd, well rather than riot, some other encrypted chat
[00:17:14] <ericonr> riv: matrix clients have a security release coming out tomorrow , btw :p
[00:17:27] <riv> uwu
[00:18:09] <rqsd> IRC is possibly one of the worst transports you could choose unless you run yuor own network/server, at which point you've simplified the threat model to TLS, client-side logging and evil hosting provider tied to real-name accounting information.
[00:20:18] <riv> but i think that if you just want to chat to someone and not have the messages be readable by anyone else, it could work
[00:20:41] <rqsd> Additionally, IRC traffic is per se suspicious as it's historically been abused for botnets and the amount of people using IRC is, uh, dwindling to say the least. Purely on a meta layer, you're interesting by the sheer fact that you connect to an IRC network
[00:21:45] <ericonr> I've currently been abusing wireguard to avoid setting up TLS for a billion and one little services :p
[00:23:04] <rqsd> If your goal is just "transmit message to person X with pre-shared key guaranteeing authenticity of X with the standard guarantees of authenticated encryption", IRC works
[00:23:16] <rqsd> But usually that's not your entire goal
[00:23:25] <rqsd> metadata bad

[03:39:50] <Arsen> you even reduce the concern of the webserver doing something dumb
[03:42:48] <Arsen> how should I decide on good argon2 parameters? I have some old hashes with `-t 1 -m 20 -p 8` but that feels awful (also massively eats memory)

[03:50:55] <Alipha> Arsen: what's the max number of users who you expect to be logging in per second?
[03:51:36] <Arsen> 1 or 2, I currently limit the daemon running argon to 2 concurrent hashes
[03:53:10] <Alipha> Arsen: okay, now what is the most amount of memory you want to be consumed by password hashing?
[03:53:49] <Arsen> 4gb of phys mem on that machine, at two max concurrent users, even 1gb will run
[03:54:04] <Arsen> we can assume ~512MB to 1GB of overhead
[03:55:01] <Alipha> Arsen: okay, then what's the target amount of time you want it to take for a user to log in?
[03:55:28] <Arsen> ~1-2s, I think, is a decent time to stall the user for
[03:59:26] <ms7821> for a system with max 2 concurrent users, implementing a password system is overkill. send them yubikeys or use magic links, and don't worry about it again

[04:00:08] <Alipha> Arsen: you're more aggressive than i am. i would have said 0.5s ;-) anyway, assuming the server may also be busy doing other things, i probably would put -p too high. 2 or maybe even 1. then i perfer to set -t at 3 because there's been some talk about 1 or 2 possibly having some attacks to it. so then with -t 3 -p 2, you just need to figure out -m. so then on your actual server hardware, try out various
[04:00:10] <Alipha> values of -m until you get a delay of 1-2s (i'm assuming you won't get anywhere near 512MB of memory used)

[04:11:36] <Arsen> (if you're alright with that)
[04:11:49] <Alipha> sure
[04:23:38] <Alipha> but yeah, my suggested algorithm for determining proper parameters: -p is 1 (multi-user) or 4 (single user). -t is 8. increase -m until you reach your desired delay (~1 second for single user. for multi-user, 0.25s / #_logins_per_second). if -m exceeds your desired memory limit (which for multi-user, you should probably divide by #_logins_per_second), then set -m to your memory limit and increase -t until you
[04:23:40] <Alipha> get your desired delay.
[04:24:20] <Alipha> for multi-user, add some DoS protection, heh

[12:31:22] <maroon> looking at shamir secret sharing, and i have a few questions: (1) how is the length of its prime related to the strength of brute-forcing the secret? ie DH public key of something-above-3000 bits is supposed to be equivalent of a 128-bit key, but would a SSS secret need to be longer than 128 bits to have 128 bits of strength?
[12:33:55] <maroon> (2) the simplistic examples i see show using a polynomial like "integer + shareA*x + shareB +x2 ...", but in real world application, would the exponents here be potentially large numbers instead of consecutive integers?
[12:35:01] *** Joins: aleck (~aleck@user/aleck)
[12:35:07] <maroon> (3) im assuming the restrictions in DH about the kind of prime dont apply to SSS? ie not required to avoid primes that aren't safe primes, and dont need to avoid "2^n +/- small_integer"
[12:35:17] <yawkat> SSS is information-theoretically secure

[12:41:05] <yawkat> i think it has to be larger than the secret
[12:42:57] <maroon> right, because the share is "math mod prime", so the secret can be 2^128-160

[15:55:42] <int-e> machinedgod: the simplistic examples are either misleading or you're not reading this correctly. the shares aren't polynomial coefficients; they're *values* of the (random, except for the secret) polynomial evaluated at particular points.
[15:55:50] <int-e> uh
[15:55:56] <int-e> maroon: ^^
[15:57:05] <int-e> maroon: Now you /can/ change the basis from x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., x^(k-1) but there's really no benefit from it, it'll just make the computations harder.
[15:59:09] <maroon> ok thanks int-e, i kinda suspected it was sorta like in DH where you can change creating pubkey from 2^privatekey to bignumber^privatekey, but it just makes the math slower
[16:00:46] *** Quits: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:01:02] <int-e> It's unlike DH in a fairly fundamental way. DH works over a group (a multiplicative structure only); SSS needs a field (a structure with addition, multiplication, and division as well)
[16:01:48] *** Quits: rustycl0ck (~ircuser@gateway/tor-sasl/rustycl0ck) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[16:03:05] <int-e> And there's the information theoretic security aspect. DH can be brute-forced (if you know the generator and the transmitted values, you can, in principle, reconstruct the exponents); SSS cannot (if you don't have enough shares, then you learn nothing about the secret)
[16:03:23] <maroon> since SSS is considered info-secure, does that mean it's post-quantum resistant, barring any flaw in how they choose random shares?

[16:07:52] <int-e> what are k and n?

[16:08:30] *** Joins: iramaro (~lore@187.3.220.187)
[16:08:49] <maroon> or k=1 would just mean that it's like a literal password
[16:08:52] <int-e> Ah. So... you generate the secret, and keep it secure.
[16:10:10] <int-e> The case n=1 is really the same as simply sharing a secret key; the polynomial you construct is constant and evaluates to the secret value everywhere.
[16:10:56] <maroon> and SSS would still need a mechanism for people to share their secret with the group without revealing their secret to the other guy who's just faking the secret he's presenting, and you can't tell which of the 3 guys isn't showing the real split-key
[16:11:44] <int-e> not part of the protocol
[16:11:59] <int-e> but surely you can sign the secrets if you want to
[16:13:46] <int-e> Also the reconstruction should be done in a way that doesn't reveal the secrets to anyone.
