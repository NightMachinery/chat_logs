[00:00:01] <eschwartz> so github, trying to distract people from talking about ICE, got people to talk about master (without slaves) instead, and they... convinced people to rename to main, because "ma<TAB>", even though that's even worse, now you need *4* characters to disambiguate main vs. maint, instead of 3 to disambiguate master and maint
[00:00:39] <eschwartz> so much muscle memory :/
[00:00:47] <bradyt> huh, hadn't heard about their involvment with ICE, just AWS
[00:00:51] <bradyt> *involvement
[00:01:51] <eschwartz> everyone bought their distraction hook line and sinker, but the real indignity is people actually respect their ability to come up with a good naming scheme... what was wrong with trunk, might I ask?
[00:01:53] <bradyt> oh, probably "development"
[00:02:04] <eschwartz> or "develop", as suggested by git-flow
[00:02:10] <bradyt> SVN trunk
[00:02:15] <DoofusCanadensis> trunk belonged to SVN
[00:02:16] <bookworm> or you know... master
[00:02:21] <DoofusCanadensis> don't reuse it!!oneone
[00:02:44] <eschwartz> in fact git-flow has a master and a develop branch, and the master branch has no earthly reason to exist since it acts as a duplicate of the third git-flow branch, "release"
[00:03:00] <bradyt> this might be where i noticed the term "trunk": https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/929
[00:03:15] <bradyt> i guess they never suggested in renaming docs
[00:04:11] <bradyt> "bleeding edge" seems too snarky for comments in tests
[00:04:12] <DoofusCanadensis> eschwartz: no, you can merge hotfixes into master as well with git-flow
[00:05:36] <eschwartz> yes, but then it still only has tagged releases which are additionally present in release-${version}
[00:06:45] <eschwartz> I have never heard a good explanation for why git-flow has a "master" branch which all release branches are merged into, other than "yay, even more bureaucratic merges"
[00:06:56] *** Quits: meator (~meator@user/meator) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:07:49] <eschwartz> it is not even conceptually a "master" copy of the code in the sense that people typically name a branch master, trunk, or develop. Because it never has the latest code, only releases...

[02:07:41] <osse> Not too difficult to script, but therw exists no direct command for it

[02:57:22] <lantech19446> eschwartz: that was my next attempt I just found someone who says they solved it with git config --unset http.postBuffer but they were on windows
[02:58:01] <lantech19446> mago: I wasn't saying to do it through ssh it's possible to but the way I understand it is that git requires it maybe eschwartz can shed some light on that like I said i'm really new like today new
[02:58:45] <lantech19446> I found a solution online that agrees with eschwartz about it being http buffer if you run the command I just told him about it may help
[02:58:53] <mago> Ok, ill try to unset the buffer..
[03:00:23] <lantech19446> if it makes you feel any better I had a ton of troubles getting git up and running this morning a couple people here were helping me all morning
[03:00:49] <kyshoc> mago: are you behind a proxy of any sort?
[03:00:55] <lantech19446> eschwartz: I thought I knew you from one of the channels lol we're both in the arch channels
[03:01:08] <mago> kyshoc no
[03:01:19] <eschwartz> that is true
[03:01:38] <mago> git clone is easy but git push OMG
[03:01:42] <lantech19446> I knew i recognized your nick I just couldn't place it right away I haven't been very active in there recently
[03:01:54] <eschwartz> to be fair, neither have I
[03:02:26] <kyshoc> mago: okay, you mentioned this is a "large folder", what do you mean exactly — are there very large individual files in this folder, or a lot of small ones? what's the total size of the folder, and the largest single file?
[03:02:29] <lantech19446> sometimes i look and they're having really heady conversations and i just want to relax

[03:03:40] <mago> It wont let me look now while i try to pus but its a few hundreds Mb folder below 800 Mb if im correct
[03:04:12] <lantech19446> oh that's not that big man I did close to a gig earlier and it worked
[03:04:32] <mago> The biggest file is like 60 Mb I think
[03:05:00] <mago> The folder is 540 MB kyshoc
[03:06:03] <kyshoc> okay, that should be fine — just fyi though, GitHub itself (not git) has a hard limit of 100MB per file
[03:06:49] <kyshoc> cool, that should be fine too
[03:06:59] <lantech19446> huh I'm glad you said that kyshoc cuz i had no idea
[03:07:03] <kyshoc> mago: what's your git version (run `git --version` to check)?
[03:07:27] <mago> git version 2.25.1

[03:46:08] <kyshoc> also, I noticed in that pastebin from earlier that git is using HTTP/2, if you think your ISP might be doing something silly you could try forcing git to use HTTP/1.1 with `git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1`
[03:46:47] <kyshoc> ^ I'd suggest trying that just to rule it out as a cause

[12:37:05] <ppang> this issue is not related to missing `less` though. It must be something else and i'll digging further

[16:41:10] <Hi-Angel> I'm wondering, isn't there a configuration to make `git checkout` do `git submodule update`? It's so annoying that every time I swich branches, a submodule change tries to get into a commit. Sometimes I even don't notice this, and actually send a patch with this change. You know, it happens when you do minor change that there's no need to even look at, and you do "amend", and on top of it git puts into the commit sunmodule change.

[18:09:54] <terminalpusher> Hello. I've got a big problem. So I have a branch called `branch1` which was merged into `main`. Then I made a new branch called `branch2`, which was based on (the state of) `branch1`. Then I committed to `branch2` and now I don't know how to merge `branch2` into `main` without having to solve tons of conflicts. There aren't actually really conflicts because `branch2` is just additions to `branch1` but only the changes of `branch1`
[18:10:15] <terminalpusher> were merged into `main`.

[18:15:30] <terminalpusher> Like if I resolve it inside `git`, it seems to rebase each commit indivudally
[18:15:39] <terminalpusher> Is it possible to rebase all commits onto another branch all at once?
[18:15:41] <j416> terminalpusher: merging has the benefit (?) of letting you leave the commits as they are without rewriting history. Rebasing has the benefit of allowing conflict resolution per-commit, which may be easier, and also the benefit that you won't end up with a merge commit with conflict resolutions, which may lead to confusion when you try to for instance track down a bug, that could then have been introduced _in_
[18:15:41] <j416> the merge commit itself. Downside (?) of rebasing is that you are effectively rewriting commits on a new base, so you'll need to take care to verify that each commit still does what is expected.

[21:45:58] <j416> having everything committed is a good idea

[21:50:24] <thiago> when I need to make a change in any of the others to cope with issues found on that machine, I make a commit, then immediately pull it to the Linux laptop.

[21:55:52] <lantech19446> hmm ok, to the partially uneducated it sounds like this would work if I used it coming from the repo also

[21:56:31] <thiago> and this is mostly for your own organisation
[21:56:33] <thiago> Git doesn't care
[21:56:49] <thiago> you could pull in a round-robin or simply fetch and cherry-pick individual commits

[21:59:50] <lantech19446> right
