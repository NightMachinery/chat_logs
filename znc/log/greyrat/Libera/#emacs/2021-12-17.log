[00:05:11] <davidkrauser> aidalgol: from my understanding Mir was written to support the Ubuntu Touch project. Wayland wasn't a good base for that use case at the time (or maybe it didn't even exist yet? I don't know). I think Unity was the same sort of rationale - it was all to support the phone
[00:05:24] <TRS-80> sounds like silo making to me

[01:34:07] <bpalmer> the-doctor: M-x customize-variable RET send-mail-function RET shows a few alternatives
[01:34:27] <twb> bpalmer: the "better thing" would be LMTP which is like SMTP but simpler.  There is no standard location for an LMTP socket, unfortnuately.
[01:35:17] <twb> bpalmer: in practice most things end up doing SMTP on 587 to a smarthost, or SMTP to localhost:25, or /usr/sbin/sendmail if they're really unixy
[01:35:28] <bpalmer> twb: I don't have a /usr/sbin/sendmail on my work system, at least (but maybe they don't want me sending mail)

[01:35:42] <twb> All of these require an annoying amount of backdoors in the daemon

[01:36:04] *** Quits: re (~user@user/re) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:36:13] <twb> e.g. msmtp's /usr/sbin/sendmail requires the container allow new TCP connections
[01:36:20] <the-doctor> Oh
[01:36:27] <the-doctor> So none of the options are great
[01:36:33] <the-doctor> or is it just sendmail
[01:36:41] <bpalmer> at any rate, I'm just making suggestions to the-doctor , because I don't understand emacs and tls issues
[01:36:45] <twb> the-doctor: the least-wrong answer is usually msmtp
[01:37:09] <artefact> you can run msmtp with firejail to limit its network/system access

[01:38:12] <twb> artefact: yes but for example when zfs-auto-snapshot runs, instead of ONLY allowing access to /dev/zfs and NOTHING else, I have to let it have the ability to use IP and TCP
[01:38:33] <twb> artefact: if there was a standardized AF_UNIX socket for mail, like there is for syslog, I would be happier
[01:38:52] <twb> smartd is another example.
[01:39:19] <twb> In theory it only needs to do ioctls to disks, and write access to /var/.  But in practice it needs a bunch of extra shit to be able to send panic emails
[01:39:20] <artefact> firejail can do "allow ip sockets but only to those destinations"
[01:39:35] <bpalmer> the-doctor: try messing with gnutls-log-level
[01:39:42] <twb> artefact: which is still 10 times worse than "has no networking"
[01:39:54] <bpalmer> "Set this larger than 0 to get debug output in the *Messages* buffer. 1 is for important messages, 2 is for debug data, and higher numbers are as per the GnuTLS logging conventions"
[01:40:12] <the-doctor> :bpalmer I'll try that
[01:40:17] <bpalmer> so if you *really* want to try debugging, (setq gnutls-log-level most-positive-fixnum) and then examine *Messages* for clues.
[01:40:21] <twb> https://github.com/cyberitsolutions/prisonpc-systemd-lockdown/tree/main/systemd/system/0-EXAMPLES
[01:40:34] <bpalmer> (probably s/most-positive-fixnum/10/ is fine)
[01:40:35] <artefact> it's mostly equivalent. a compromised smartd could just pipe whatever it wanted to your unix socket to send mail
[01:41:00] <artefact> unless you don't trust netfilter, that's a valid point

[01:42:13] * bpalmer suspects foul play.
[01:42:28] <twb> If you have to support postfix *or* msmtp, you have to enable like 3.0 worth of shit
[01:43:10] <bpalmer> aye. just open up a directory for writes that you separately have a webserver watching.
[01:43:22] <twb> artefact: if you want custom nft rules, then you need to write a whole separate unit to load in those rules.  It's not really supported by systemd.

[08:22:32] <dale> python.el got a rewrite maybe five years ago or so and I think it got a lot better.

[08:56:22] <bpalmer> aidalgol: online store that regularly releases new NFTs, I guess. "The Melania Trump NFT platform utilizes the Solana blockchain protocol; an dwill accept both the SOL cryptocurrency and credit card payments through MoonPay. Parler is powering the platform."

[08:56:44] <aidalgol> lol, "SOL"
[08:58:13] <dale> Oh holy shit it's sending string to complete, then TAB, then a bunch of backspace characters to the Python REPL to trigger completion.  Why not just use the completion machinery directly?
[08:58:38] <dale> And I also managed to hit some reentrant SIGWINCH signal handler bug that's been open on Python for over a year.
[08:58:56] <bpalmer> ... so, amusingly, that was from the press release. Since then, MoonPay has said it "has no official role in the effort" and "it is not possible to make credit card payments through MoonPay to purchase Melania Trump's NFT collection"

[15:01:54] <pingpongball> i dont know , because to show eltist attitude  or to look different to friends, i'm using emacs
[15:02:14] <pingpongball> although i love emacs because it is fully command based
[15:02:27] <pingpongball> but god this slowness
[15:02:45] <pingpongball> like for example when i press j to go down
[15:02:52] <artefact> is emacs -q slow?
[15:03:05] <pingpongball> means doom emacs slow, emacs is not slow
[15:03:09] <defanor> Generally the closer you are to vanilla Emacs, the snappier it is. Not sure how useful profiling can be with small lags here and there, but at you can at least try to disable packages one by one and observe the effects.

[20:45:43] <permacu> Hi Emacs Lovers, I have been playing around with how emacs compiles closures. Think defun inside toplevel let. Emacs compiles byte-code that creates the closure @ run-time, storing the closed over vars boxed in a cons inside the constants vector (internal-make-closure). If I native compile the same code, the closure still gets created @ run-time as a byte-code function. Is this the intended behaviour? Or is it possible to native compile
[20:45:43] <permacu> closures in Emacs? Where would they store their lex-env then?

[21:03:37] <roto> I have a strange   behaviour
[21:03:59] <roto> in a local git repository on eshell I can use ripgrep like "rg something" and it works ok
[21:04:10] <roto> but... "rg console" is freezing emacs and taking a lot of time
[21:04:29] <roto> only happens with gtk3 emacs, with "emacs -nw" it doesn't happen
[21:04:56] <roto> after a few minutes of emacs taking 100% of one core, it begins to work properly that "rg console" command

[23:23:07] <mwnaylor> Upraded to SE30 my senior year. Needed extra power for compiler workshop. My compiler theory code was starting to run into the 32k limit for code fork segments. Using Borland Pascal. I did not know enough at the time to use compiler directives/pragmas to break things up.
[23:23:36] <bremner> ah Borland _Turbo_ Pascal
[23:23:52] <bremner> I wrote an adventure game in HS in that
[23:24:06] <pjb> and a hard disk! SE30 4 MB RAM + 40 MB Hard disk!
[23:24:06] <bremner> I mean I was in high school when I wrote it. 
[23:24:32] <bremner> rudybot: high school would be a good setting for a horror game, amirite?
[23:24:39] <mwnaylor> Got lucky. DU hosted a Mac event. With studend ID, we were able to purchase Turbo Pascal for $20.

[23:29:04] <bremner> mwnaylor: true enough. Eventually there's enough money left over after bills and taxes that I don't mind so much.
[23:29:29] <mwnaylor> Someday, I'll recreate the emulated computer and the assembler in Clojure. If I manage that, maybe redo the OS we wrote as part of our weekly assignments.

[23:31:21] <tali713> pjb: and that's where my lack of experiance with python comes into play.  The simple solution was simply get/write_mem(ptr, index, value), since the rules require that a. the heap be a uniform array of fixed sizes and b. size of allocated buffer and link to next buffer need to be in the cell at index -1 relative to a buffer pointer.  (and screw it, stick the available/free flag there since we have the bits)
[23:32:35] *** Quits: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me) (Quit: leaving)
[23:34:22] <tali713> so (unless I'm gravely mistaken about something in python) I would think that means you have to unpack and repack anyways to fit 3 fields in one word.
[23:34:50] <tali713> and that I am gravely mistaken about something in python is a high probability.
[23:35:16] <bremner> rudybot: is babby the something in python? I told you to check the door on that cage.
[23:36:44] <rudybot> bremner: I heard you didn't like forming babby, but I accidentally an arrow to the knee
[23:36:57] <bremner> all true

[23:37:42] <tali713> rudybot: when did you get hitched and who is the lovely automata?
[23:37:50] <mwnaylor> I started on the emulate computer part, but got lost in many rabbit trails. It's been dormant too long. I'm currently going through the Advent of Code puzzles, implementing all solutions in Clojure to rebuild that skill set. I haven't touched the emulator code in 2 years. Even with that time away, 2021 AoC lets me know I did some thing that were terribly wrong.
[23:37:54] <rudybot> tali713: being contained within emacs has the benefit of portability and the malus of being hitched to emacs's instabilities and lack of multi-threading

[23:44:30] <mwnaylor> wasamasa: or maybe not. The state of the memory from one operation should be deterministic and pure.
[23:45:21] <tali713> I think that's assumed, but then idiomatically even though you can write it functionally, you are still doing mostly state ops.

[23:47:18] <tali713> but for something like e.g. a digital logic simulator, functional is just fine.

[23:48:44] <mwnaylor> But, using recur, within a loop or defn block, we get fp. The original memory structure is not changed. The new state gets passed into the next call.

[23:51:15] <bremner> and that's not a good thing
[23:52:03] <pjb> tali713: yes, but also, you can choose sizeof(int)=1 so you don't have to pack multiple fields or multiple chars in a word.

[23:55:38] <mwnaylor> With some creative use of either atom or ref, it's possible to have a sliding window of prior states. That might be useful if I get ambitious enough to have a debug mode in the emulator.

[23:58:32] <mwnaylor> Not trying to get into Clojure weeds, but the topic, at the abstract level, is dealing with general design/development topics that appeal to past and curren experience.
