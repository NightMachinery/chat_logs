[03:54:55] <TomatoSynth> many japanese love cabbage rock, especially the Tzadik guys and their affiliates like acid mothers and their contemporaries
[03:55:06] <TomatoSynth> boris is coming to mind, too, with this
[03:55:35] <TomatoSynth> softer, lower-case b boris, not BORIS
[03:55:59] <TomatoSynth> tago mago just might be the best rock album, too
[03:56:10] <TomatoSynth> and a lot of folks on irc don't know it, smh
[03:56:42] <TomatoSynth> just about all 70s rock sounds dated af in 2022, not can and a few others
[03:58:38] <macrobat> I thought boris was more regular rock
[03:58:58] <macrobat> hmm
[03:58:58] <TomatoSynth> depends what you've heard, there is a lot of it

[06:57:15] <Panther> The notion of determinism was most famously articulated by Laplace, who suggested that ‘we ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow.’(Laplace(1820)) That is, a theory is deterministic if according to that theory, the present state of the universe, together with the laws of nature, is sufficient 
[06:57:15] <Panther> to fix everything that happens in the future. We will refer to this approach as ‘Laplacean determinism.’

[18:55:30] <artao> BenQ makes high quality monitors for video editing and such. Color correct. 250 is quite inexpensive for one
[18:55:39] <DunceCotus> just gimme gamut

[19:01:23] <artao> nah. just leave it on loop in the background for months at a time

[19:17:38] <DunceCotus> or even religious ones maybe
