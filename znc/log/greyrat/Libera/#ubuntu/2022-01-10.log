[05:33:59] <jhutchins> There's a kernel module that has to be updated to the release point of your chipset, otherwise it can't find the adddress to load it.  You can find the messages about that in dmesg - pretty sure the kernel module is "nv".

[07:22:12] <Fryuni> If you run `ls -l /usr/bin/python*` you'll see that there are multiple python executable (and related). Normally `/usr/bin/python` is just a link to an actual python executable. You can delete it and create a new one pointing to `/usr/bin/python3.9`
[07:22:39] <AugustusCaesar24> would it be safe to do that?
[07:25:40] <Fryuni> If the default is pointing to another 3.x version, then pretty much yes, there should not be any breaking changes. If the default is python2 then there might be services depending on that, the best-practice would be to use `python2` but if there are any depending on `python` being version 2 they would break

I've searched for that error online, but all I can get is info about what a tty is and what the console is. But thinking helpful on that error. Like I say only a few are afected and all of them it appears that /dev/console is setup correctly with device

[16:55:47] <jwhitmore> jchittum, thank you. I was looking for device numbers 5,1 but even on working systems I have those device numbers reported from 'ls- -l' so it's not that. I agree with your 'wonky' but I'm not sure where the kernel marries a device number to a physical port. I guess I need to look at commands for hardware info to see if the issue is in some discrepency there
