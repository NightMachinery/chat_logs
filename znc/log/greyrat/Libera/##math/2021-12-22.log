[00:51:37] <diverdude> loadedanvils: yeah
[00:51:40] <loadedanvils> are you missing something?
[00:51:45] <diverdude> loadedanvils: no
[00:52:11] <loadedanvils> you’re picking 1 from each list, that should get you 3 elements, but you say you want 1,1
[00:52:28] <diverdude> i want to see in how many ways i can draw 2 ones if i draw 1 number from each list
[00:52:47] <diverdude> see = calculate
[00:53:25] <loadedanvils> exactly two 1s or at least two 1s
[00:53:31] <diverdude> exactly
[00:54:43] <loadedanvils> so you have three ways to draw two 1s: (1,1,x), (1,x,1), (x,1,1)
[00:56:28] <diverdude> loadedanvils: remember that i can only draw 1 number from each list
[00:56:35] <diverdude> loadedanvils: i see 5 different ways
[00:56:52] <loadedanvils> if you’re ignoring the other number, you have 2 ways to get the first case, 1 way to get the second, 2 ways to get the last
[00:57:00] <diverdude> i mean 6
[00:57:29] <diverdude> 1 1 x, 1 1 x, 1 x 1, x 1 1 and x 1 1
[00:57:57] <diverdude> sorry - first one is a dupe

[04:05:39] <rapier> guys, i saw a video today from a tech lead guy where he claims average as statistical metric shouldn't be used to compare salaries, he also says average should be used for describing independent events situations and that the best way for salary comparison is through power law. I saw the entire video and i not sure, i don't agree with him... how couldn't "average" help someone to make their evaluations? and you? any thoughts about?

[04:07:04] <average> rapier: also that guy is somewhat controversial :P
[04:07:06] <isekaijin> Guest45: The Fourier transform maps functions of a variable, usually thought of as a “time” or “space” variable, into another function of one variable, usually thought of as a “frequency” variable.
[04:07:09] <Guest45> oh is that because the "y" here is gonna dictate the frequency in that eulers equation e^(-ix y) ?

[04:07:25] <rapier> oh man, this was very funny
[04:08:05] <isekaijin> Guest45: Yeah, also that. If the variable of your original function has U units, then the variable of its Fourier transform has U^{-1} units.
[04:08:19] <Guest45> wtf
[04:08:22] <isekaijin> Because exponentials only make sense for dimensionless variables.

[04:11:42] <[itchyjunk]> i thought you would tell me ;_;
[04:12:11] <Guest45> actually it should be a double integral?

[04:17:56] <Guest45> and I want to know the fourier transform of that
[04:18:02] <isekaijin> Guest45: You don't *have* to. It really depends on what you want to do.
[04:18:15] <rapier> i'm so sorry, isekaijin... i meant "mean" and not average
[04:18:20] <Guest45> oh yeah. I could just only do the spatial variable if I wanted

[04:19:36] <rapier> ha ha
[04:19:44] <mefistofeles> rapier: you'd be surprised xD
[04:19:57] <isekaijin> Statistics is on-topic. Translating your HR problem into a statistics problem is off-topic.
[04:20:02] <mefistofeles> rapier: but basically it's because the mean is not necessarily a good descriptor of your sample/distribution
[04:21:26] <rapier> mefistofeles, so why power law would it be a good descriptor than mean for sample/distribution?
[04:21:39] <mefistofeles> I don't understand the question
[04:21:48] <mefistofeles> do you know what a descriptor of a distribution is in statistics?
[04:22:17] <rapier> means, mode, median
[04:22:42] <rapier> they are distribution descriptors

[04:24:37] <rapier> statistical descriptors of data help us measure some very special properties of the distribution
[04:24:44] <rapier> am i mistaken?
[04:25:12] <Guest45> isekaijin I write: u^_tt(k) + |k|^2 u^(k) = 0, where I use k (kappa) instead of u and I use ^ to denote FT
[04:25:26] <mefistofeles> yeah, but not all of them are used the same, it depends on the distribution... https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs
[04:25:33] <Guest45> the k^2 comes from not being able to pull out the differential operator
[04:25:43] <mefistofeles> you can have some of them (specially the mean) to be the same for totally different distributions
[04:25:50] <Guest45> and I'm just doing the FT for the spatial var
[04:26:08] <mefistofeles> and that's why the mean is not necessarily a good parameters, you have to know a bit more (the distribution itself, hopefully)

[04:37:09] <rapier> thank you
[04:37:35] <isekaijin> Guest45: Your original equation was the wave equation u_{tt}(x,t) = u_{xx}(x,t), right?
[04:37:41] <isekaijin> Let U(k,t) be the Fourier transform of u(x,t) w.r.t. the variable x.
[04:38:04] <isekaijin> Then we have U_{tt}(k,t) = -k^2 U(k,t).
[04:38:52] *** Joins: superz (~superegg@user/superegg)
[04:38:53] <isekaijin> Or, in more detail, U_{tt}(k,t) = (ik)^2 U(k,t) = -k^2 U(k,t).
[04:39:48] <isekaijin> [Right now, I forget the exact assumptions on u(x,t) so that the Fourier transform of its n-th derivative is (ik)^n U(k,t), sadly.]

[04:41:05] <isekaijin> I just don't remember what the exact condition is right now.
[04:41:15] <Guest45> it says it there: u has to be in "L^2"
[04:41:17] <Guest45> whatever that means
[04:41:24] <isekaijin> Oh, okay.
[04:41:28] <isekaijin> I know what L^2 means.

[04:42:37] <isekaijin> In this case, it means that \int_{-\infty}^\infty |u(x,t)|^2 dx is finite, I think.
[04:42:54] <isekaijin> Wait, L^2 has nothing to do with smoothness.
[04:43:02] <isekaijin> It's an integrability condition.

[04:43:17] <isekaijin> But anyhow.
[04:43:32] <isekaijin> For the time being, let's just assume that the condition, whatever it is, holds.
[04:44:43] <Guest45> sure. Uhm, so from my notes I think we wrote |k| because we just care about the value k not it's sign
[04:45:08] <isekaijin> We don't even care about the value of k.
[04:45:23] <isekaijin> The function of k is just a device for solving the original differential equation.
[04:45:34] *** Joins: karlosz (~karlosz@47.151.136.69)
[04:46:16] <isekaijin> But I don't think the expression with |k|^2 is correct if we think of k as a complex variable.
[04:52:41] <Guest45> ah, I figure out how that rule (differentiation ) comes from. Its just integration by parts!
[04:54:36] <isekaijin> Oh, right.
[04:54:49] <isekaijin> So then we need u(x,t) and its derivatives w.r.t. x to vanish at infinity.
[04:55:01] <Guest45> hence that integrability condition

But then there's a considerably nastier one: the 1,1 hodge star, where as far as I can tell I'm going to need a (really, *really* sparse, as opposed to just regular sparse of, say, the differentia matrix) matrix for each face, which encodes the direction and pairing data for the two inputs.

[10:38:02] <frelleck> probably not rex
[10:38:19] <rex> frelleck: yeah intuitively I'd say so
[10:38:34] <rex> However I'm unable to find a somewhat easy proof
[10:38:39] <frelleck> you have (a + b) dot (a + b) = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2a dot b < 1
[10:39:15] <frelleck> use dot products and you get the angle between a and b is at least 60 degrees, same for the other two angles
[10:39:46] <frelleck> something like that
[10:40:09] <rex> Ah yeah ℝ^2 is even a hilbert space not only Banach :)
[10:41:29] <frelleck> a dot b < -1/2 I guess is what we get
[10:41:47] <frelleck> so the angle is at leasrt 120 degrees
[10:41:56] <frelleck> greater than 120 I should say
[10:42:06] <frelleck> same for angle between b and c, and a and c
[10:42:14] <frelleck> so they add up to more than 360
[10:42:28] <int-e> you want a dot b < -|a||b|/2 but you get that as well
[10:43:00] <frelleck> that's what I meant
[10:43:12] <frelleck> anyhow I think that's all there is to it

[13:13:08] <Codaraxis> I'm trying to write an algorithm whereby, given a pair of points on a circle and a radius, I replace the arc length between them with a sequence of 45 * n degree lines relative to a specific coordinate system, so as to minimize the difference in total length. I feel like an (irregular) octagon is probably the ideal basis for the line segments, but I was wondering if anyone can recommend anything to read for how to think about this

Octagon's indeed the best shape for this, though given the underlying coordinate system orientation, I'll need to enlarge the octagon so it circumscribes the circle. Then, figure out % of circumference described by the arc, and probably cut the first and last octagonal segments short. Woo.

[14:55:19] <[-_-]> Can there be residue if there is no pole?
[14:57:35] <riv> if there is no pole, the residue is 0
[14:57:55] <riv> the reason for this is, you can think of the residue as coefficient a_{-1} of the series expansion
[14:58:11] <riv> if there's no pole the series expansion would be like  a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + ...

[16:22:51] <isekaijin> RadSurfer: What “spherical coordinates” means is that the surfaces of the form “r = positive constant” are spheres.
[16:23:06] <isekaijin> RadSurfer: But the coordinates themselves don't describe a sphere. They describe a point.

[19:44:58] <riv> there is a concept called a ring homomorphism
[19:45:06] <riv> this may be what is meant by structure-preserving map
[19:45:18] <riv> one of the requirements of a ring homomorphism is that f(0) = 0
[19:45:29] <riv> f(x) = x + 1 violates this, so it's not a ring homomorphism

[19:47:47] <somiaj> One property of homomorphisms is f(0) = 0, but in your example f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1, fails this property

[19:48:03] <laurus> (haven't really looked at this stuff for a couple of years)
[19:48:20] <somiaj> with a cyclic group, you can send any generator to any other generator
[19:48:38] <somiaj> so with Z_3 = {0,1,2} you basiclaly have two choices 1->1 or 1->2 as the map
[19:48:51] <laurus> somiaj: Well, isn't 1 -> 2 the function f(x) = x + 1 ?
[19:48:51] <somiaj> so that gives two maps, the second being equivlant to the one riv mentioned
[19:48:54] <laurus> Or are they somehow different?
[19:49:38] <somiaj> laurus: no, f(1) = 2, f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4 = 1, and f(0) = f(1+1+1) = f(1) + f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 = 0 all mod3
[19:50:11] <somiaj> basically since 1 is a generator, you can write every element in terms of 1, then use the structure preserving aspect of the function to compute what the new thing needs to be
[19:50:35] <somiaj> laurus: note there are lots of functions which send 1->2, but in this case there is a unique one that preserves the structure since both 1 and 2 are generators
[19:51:03] <laurus> somiaj: Aha, that's interesting, great explanation, thank you!
[19:51:06] <laurus> riv: thank you as well

[19:51:43] <somiaj> IN general this works for any cyclic group, if a and b are two generators of the cylic group, then a->b induces an automorphism between the groups
[19:52:19] <laurus> Very cool. I appreciate the explanation
[19:52:22] <somiaj> though really if a (a genertor) is mapped to c (maybe not a generator) you still induce a homomorphism, but it isn't an isomorphism if c isn't a generator because you won't generate the whole group
[19:53:14] <somiaj> Hence in Z_3, sending 1->0 is still a homomorphism but not an isomoprhism since this is equivlant to sending every element to zero, creating the zero subgroup
[19:53:27] <laurus> That makes sense.
[19:54:04] <somiaj> Now if your group isn't cyclic, you can't uniquely define homomorphisms based on where you map a generator

[20:08:22] <[itchyjunk]> what about:
[20:08:50] <[itchyjunk]> y \in {x \in N\{0} | P(x) = x^2 }
[20:08:59] <riv> it could be { x in N | exists y in N, x = y^2 }
[20:09:05] <[itchyjunk]> wait no, i am just bruteforcing
[20:09:16] <[itchyjunk]> well "exists" is something that comes in next chapter
[20:09:23] <[itchyjunk]> so wondering what they think the solution is
[20:12:14] <Z-module> Why are you sure you should avoid quantifiers?
[20:12:27] <Z-module> It feels absurd, except for (c) which is a finite set.

[20:21:32] <riv> {x \in N\{0} |x^2} is not right
[20:21:37] <riv> x^2 is a number, but you need a proposition in that place

[22:53:18] <cherim> So have you solved the "for all epsilon > 0: P(X <= -epsilon) <= V/(V + epsilon^2)" with a quadratic function?

[22:57:00] <johnkeats6> kamil, so many mistakes for such a short message
[22:59:09] <rex> cherim: no i have not
[23:00:00] <rex> cherim: you got an idea?
[23:00:10] <johnkeats6> he always does
[23:00:31] <cherim> It's easy to do but not exactly with one computation for some clever function
[23:01:21] <cherim> Let X1 be the distribution of X conditioned on X<=-eps, and X2 the distribution conditioned on X>-eps
[23:01:42] <cherim> Then E(X1)<=-eps, and E(X1^2)>=eps^2
[23:01:56] <cherim> Let also p=P(X<=-eps) that we need
[23:02:26] <cherim> From EX=0 we have E(X2)>=p/(1-p) * eps
[23:02:55] <cherim> From Var X = V we have p * eps^2 + (1-p) * E(X2^2) <= V

[23:03:26] <cherim> The inequality we use is Var(X2)>=0, i.e. E(X2^2) >= E(X2)^2
[23:04:03] <cherim> When substituted, it yields V/eps^2 >=p/(1-p). This is your desired inequality
[23:05:08] <cherim> I think the intended solution is different so post when you find one
[23:05:36] <rex> cherim: will do :) but yeah I think the intended one is very different :)
[23:06:08] <cherim> The above also shows when equality is attained, you can have X concentrated on -eps and eps * p/(1-p)
[23:06:38] <cherim> So Var(X2)=0, and what we did shows the natural picture
[23:08:11] <rex> cherim: what does X conditioned on X ≤ -ε mean?
[23:08:34] <rex> P(X1 = k) = P(X = k | X ≤ -ε) ?
[23:08:42] <johnkeats6> maybe the conditional expectation of X on the sigma algebra generated by {X <= -eps}
