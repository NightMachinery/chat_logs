[00:05:24] <river> Diablo II! cool
[00:05:37] <river> outer wilds is the last 10/10 game I played
[00:06:50] <drakonis> you should check the 100/10 game disco elysium
[00:07:11] <bkero> Ah crap I should actually finish Outer Wilds
[00:07:19] <bkero> I always get it confused with Outer Worlds since they came out around the same time.
[00:09:04] <manicennui> Remember Out of This World?
[00:09:43] <river> yes
[00:10:06] <river> and flashback
[00:10:17] <river> Out of This World was extremely difficult, i never got far
[00:10:21] <river> but it was very good
[00:10:54] <manicennui> Yeah, I never got far, but I loved how weird it was.

[00:11:26] <manicennui> I think I had it for PC.
[00:19:02] <dimadima> manicennui: you just mean visually cool?
[00:19:30] <manicennui> dimadima: I see it and I'm like, "Oh! What is this?!"
[00:19:38] <manicennui> Then I realize what it is and think, "Oh. I don't want that."
[00:20:10] <manicennui> Or do you mean Out of This World?
[00:20:22] <manicennui> Sorry, I'm not sure which of my random thoughts you are responding to.
[00:20:35] <manicennui> If you were asking about Out of This World, then yes.
[00:21:22] <dimadima> yeah i meant that vinyl record
[00:22:19] <dimadima> TLOU is a game and they release a vinyl of the score?
[00:22:20] <manicennui> Yeah, I like how it looks.
[00:22:27] <manicennui> But I have 0 interest in the game or its soundtrack.
[00:24:28] <dimadima> they should do quake sountrack LP
[00:24:35] <drakonis> they already have
[00:24:49] <dimadima> lol

[00:27:22] <dimadima> cross marketing never disappoints
[00:27:56] <dimadima> not one, but TWO records
[00:30:07] <manicennui> I hate when places selling vinyl don't feel the need to provide some audio samples.
[00:48:51] <dimadima> i've always hated audio samples
[00:49:30] <dimadima> but yeah why not provide audio samples

[21:09:29] <dimadima> manicennui: comments on that reddit say it all
[21:09:46] <dimadima> same situation in the states i guess.
[21:10:19] <manicennui> Americans would lose their shit if all immigrants left and construction and agriculture industries collapsed.
[21:11:14] <manicennui> Even just illegal immigrants leaving would have a huge impact on those industries.
[21:11:33] <dimadima> that's my dream
[21:11:40] <dimadima> not cause i don't like migrants
[21:11:47] <dimadima> but because i want to see what would happen
[21:11:54] <manicennui> I don't. I want tacos.
[21:12:07] <manicennui> Plus, you know, fresh produce.
[21:12:33] <dimadima> me too but i think i would lean toward sacrificing a little to see the result
[21:13:05] <manicennui> "About half of all crop hands in the United States, more than one million, are undocumented immigrants, according to the Agriculture Department. Growers and labor contractors estimate that the share is closer to 75 percent."
[21:13:11] <manicennui> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-undocumented-immigrant-farmworkers-agriculture.html
[21:13:14] <dimadima> yeah
[21:13:27] <dimadima> canada too
[21:13:40] <dimadima> i wonder if its a problem in mexico at this point
[21:13:42] <manicennui> dimadima: The people who need to learn the lesson won't.
[21:13:48] <manicennui> See brexit.
[21:14:27] <manicennui> Just as we can't just hope that idiots continue to avoid vaccines and die.
[21:14:29] <dimadima> i don't know much about brexit
[21:14:36] <manicennui> They impact innocent people, and don't learn anything.
[21:14:41] <dimadima> the thing with covid is more people do recover
[21:14:54] <dimadima> overhwelmingly so
[21:14:59] <dimadima> so no one will ever learn anything
[21:15:15] <manicennui> I was really sad when Trump recovered.
[21:15:26] <dimadima> i really liked the cory doctorow piece that was on HN the other day
[21:15:36] <dimadima> manicennui: if trump had died i would have become religious
[21:17:03] <dimadima> "wow, god _does_ exists"
[21:17:19] <manicennui> And he has taken the form of a virus.
[21:17:29] <manicennui> Much cooler than Jesus.
[21:17:36] <dimadima> certainly
[21:17:46] <manicennui> Maybe God can come back as a kitty next time.
[21:18:16] <manicennui> I'd pet God.

[21:18:53] <dimadima> lol manicennui
[21:19:23] <manicennui> Why am I not surprised that Reagan took part in spreading misinformation about smoking?
[21:19:42] <dimadima> i think that's before smoking misinformation?
[21:19:49] <dimadima> i'm guessing that ad is from the 50s
[21:19:58] <dimadima> although people always knew smoking was bad, even in the 1800s etc
[21:20:51] <dimadima> although, i've been slowly reading the diary of samuel pepys, and i'm up to the plague of 1665 in london
[21:21:08] <dimadima> and england in general , i guess. and they had kids smoking to prevent them from catching plague
[21:21:10] <manicennui> dimadima: The ad at the top is for "mild" cigarettes. The implication was that they were healthier. It is bullshit.
[21:21:19] *** Quits: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:21:32] <dimadima> i'm not sure that was known at the time of this ad
[21:21:38] <manicennui> The tobacco companies obviously knew there was a problem at that point and tried to sell "less bad" products, but they were complete nonsense.
[21:21:48] <manicennui> I'm sure it was by the tobacco companies.
[21:21:49] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[21:22:01] <dimadima> my interpretation is if you smoke a lot you have a sore throat all the time and a post nasal drip so you're looking for something milder
[21:22:26] <manicennui> Tobacco industry insiders by the mid 1950s clearly knew their product was dangerous. In December of 1953, when Hill and Knowlton was exploring how to respond to the uproar surrounding the publication of carcinogens in cigarette smoke, one tobacco company research director commented in a confidential interview: ‘Boy! Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to
[21:22:26] <manicennui> competition!’ Another remarked on how fortunate it was ‘for us’ (ie, for cigarette manufacturers) that smokers were engaging in ‘a habit they can't break’.24
[21:22:48] *** Quits: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat) (Client Quit)
[21:23:20] <dimadima> well then
[21:23:58] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[21:24:16] <manicennui> Basically all of the different features/types of cigarettes that tobacco companies sold to make their product appear less bad were bullshit and they knew it.
[21:24:20] <dimadima> always good to bring the facts!
[21:25:03] <dimadima> i liked that piece not even for the tobacco stuff but for it's takes on how industries leverage nihilism
[21:25:12] <manicennui> At this point the worst interpretation is usually the correct one for tobacco companies.
[21:25:14] <dimadima> doubt -> nihilism -> win
[21:25:39] <dimadima> but i'm not trying to distract from the tobacco stuff either, just saying
[21:25:44] <manicennui> It's kind of sad that so many people want to smoke weed now that it is legal.
[21:25:53] <manicennui> Stop inhaling smoke idiots!
[21:26:13] <dimadima> it's really weird that people act like it's not smoking
[21:26:18] <dimadima> FWIW there is only so much weed you can smoke
[21:27:21] <manicennui> People who smoke pot extremely frequently also develop problems too.
[21:27:54] <dimadima> the people who can smoke weed like tobacco are a total mystery to me
[21:28:02] <dimadima> tobacco is easy smoking
[21:28:04] <dimadima> weed... not so
[21:28:23] <dimadima> yeah i'm sure they do
[21:31:36] <dimadima> sigh
[21:31:44] <dimadima> i wish i had a graphic department
[21:31:52] <dimadima> i am the graphics department
[21:32:39] <dimadima> manicennui: a friend is in chicago right now. she says it's a beautiful day
[21:33:24] <dcz_> people do lots of dangerous or risky things for pleasure, that doesn't make them idiots automatically
[21:33:25] <manicennui> Yeah, it's sunny.
[21:33:37] <manicennui> Upper 60s.
[21:34:02] <manicennui> dcz_: It's not doing them that makes them idiots. It's denying that it's dangerous or may have negative effects.
[21:34:26] <manicennui> And if doing them also puts other people at risk, then fuck them.
[21:34:32] <dcz_> that clarification makes sense
[21:35:18] <dcz_> it's hard to get through to actual smokers with that argument though… at least not impossible
[21:35:48] <manicennui> If smokers could stick to smoking alone in places where they will not impact anyone else, it wouldn't be a problem.
[21:35:51] <manicennui> But they don't.
[21:36:10] <manicennui> Even now with smoking banned in so many places, they will smoke right outside the entrances to places, so everyone must walk through their smoke.
[21:36:28] <manicennui> At the last place I worked they would smoke in the parking garage elevator bank.
[21:36:55] <manicennui> dimadima: Decent piece.
[21:36:59] <dcz_> balconies and leaky walls/floors are most infuriating
[21:38:06] <manicennui> I have a friend who started smoking again a few years ago due to stress at work. He has finally quit, but now he vapes.
[21:38:13] <manicennui> He isn't annoying about it, but it is sad that he got back into it.
[21:38:23] <dcz_> lesser evil?
[21:38:32] <manicennui> I suppose.
[21:38:39] <manicennui> He had a kid, which is the real reason he quit smoking.
[21:38:53] <manicennui> It's amazing how often he smoked though.
[21:38:56] <manicennui> And how often he vapes now.
[21:39:10] <dcz_> I do hope those who say second hand vaping is not dangerous are right
[21:39:13] <manicennui> If we have long conversations he must smoke/vape every hour or two.
[21:40:22] <manicennui> I can't imagine having an addiction that must be fed that often.
[21:40:39] <manicennui> Of course my web browsing/mindless entertainment could be considered that.
[21:41:15] <dcz_> same
[21:42:08] <dcz_> which makes me think I can totally imagine. thankfully that makes my adiction slot full
[21:42:53] <manicennui> If eating candy didn't make me fatter, and I never felt full or sick from eating it, I might have a candy addiction.
[21:42:56] <dimadima> manicennui: an hour or two isn't even that bad, fwiw
[21:43:19] <dimadima> not saying it's good, but there's a chance he's trying to minimize if he's going 2 hours
[21:43:36] <dimadima> I really this sequence:
[21:43:38] <dimadima> > The gap between cause and effect is where denial lives, because this gap obscures reality.
[21:43:43] <dimadima> ﻿and then
[21:43:51] <dimadima> > Any time the consequences of an action are separated by a lot of time and space from the action itself, the people who profit from that action will be able to obscure the harm it does to you.
[21:43:56] <dimadima> and finally:
[21:44:04] <dimadima> > Denial slides ever so easily into nihilism.
[21:44:07] <dimadima> bada-bing
[21:44:16] <dimadima> now anything is game
[21:44:22] <dcz_> what is meant by "nihilism"?
[21:44:22] <dimadima> i'd never considered that so clearly before
[21:44:27] <manicennui> I think about this sort of thing in regards to food quite often.
[21:44:34] <riv> oof yes
[21:44:35] <manicennui> We really know very little about diet.
[21:44:36] <dimadima> an absense of truth
[21:44:50] <dcz_> "ignorance" I'd call it
[21:45:01] <dimadima> or a system by which truth can be discerned
[21:45:02] <manicennui> And the FDA doesn't do multi-year studies before declaring that some food ingredient is safe.
[21:45:10] <dimadima> epistemology itslef is impossible
[21:45:36] <manicennui> YT recommended some pro-fat documentary to me recently.
[21:45:42] <dimadima> once you can sell people that nothing is true or real, you can sell then anything
[21:46:04] <dimadima> the pro fat thing is something else
[21:46:11] <manicennui> Frankly, the vegans and the low carb folks use a lot of bad logic in their arguments.
[21:46:17] <manicennui> And you can find studies to support either.
[21:46:33] <dcz_> oh, so the result is that denial results in intentionally doscarding the truth and pretending that it can't be discerned? I've seen it play out this way with moral values
[21:46:35] <manicennui> And we know that all kinds of diets can "work" in the short-term.
[21:46:40] <dimadima> my sister is like that. quick to shit on people for fat shaming. but then she had no qualms getting the vaccine early because she's overweight
[21:46:43] <dimadima> that was irriating
[21:46:57] <manicennui> dimadima: I do think that we demonized fat too much.
[21:47:05] <dimadima> sure
[21:47:07] <manicennui> But I don't think that means we should just eat as much fat as possible.
[21:47:26] <dimadima> dcz_: yeah i think something like that
[21:47:28] <manicennui> I really think it all boils down to overall intake, avoiding highly processed shit, and being way more active.
[21:47:46] <manicennui> But the idea that carbs are a problem is just nonsense.
[21:48:11] <manicennui> There are billions of people who survive on mostly carbs and are not fat and do not suffer from the types of diseases that we do at the rates that we do.
[21:48:25] <manicennui> Basically most of humanity for the last couple thousand years.
[21:48:26] <dimadima> those people tend to be quite active
[21:48:30] <manicennui> Yeah.
[21:48:38] <manicennui> I think that is a key that is missing from most of the discussions.
[21:48:46] <manicennui> And it is the same for people eating body builder diets.
[21:48:48] <dimadima> people used to _only_ eat bread
[21:48:53] <dcz_> too many confounding factors tp draw conclusions IMO
[21:48:58] <dimadima> yeah
[21:49:07] <dimadima> way too many factors
[21:49:17] <manicennui> I don't think we can draw any strong conclusions on diet alone.

[21:49:27] <buttsbot> MyStackOverflowed comments on Big problems at the timezone database
[21:50:15] <manicennui> I think the real question is how we can help people be more active as we urbanize without expecting everyone to stick to a gym schedule.
[21:50:22] <manicennui> And I think there is an answer too.
[21:50:34] <manicennui> But it is counter to the way nearly all American cities are designed.
[21:50:59] <dimadima> i've been with people who took a cab 5 blocks
[21:51:04] <dimadima> i shit you not, 5 blocks
[21:51:08] <manicennui> Sure.
[21:51:21] <dimadima> some people don't like to move
[21:51:22] <manicennui> I've done it when I have groceries.
[21:51:44] <dimadima> that's not what i'm talking about :)
[21:51:49] <manicennui> I think it has to go far further than even cities like Chicago and NYC do.
[21:51:55] <manicennui> Driving has to become uncommon.
[21:52:02] <manicennui> And it can't just be a choice.
[21:52:08] <dcz_> I wonder if Barcelona is seeing the benefits of their pedestrian zones in fitness
[21:52:10] <manicennui> Driving has to become super inconvenient.
[21:52:29] <manicennui> dcz_: Do they cover significant portions of the city?
[21:52:37] <dcz_> as far as I know, yes
[21:53:01] <dcz_> IIRC 10-30%?
[21:53:37] <manicennui> I'm just wondering where it is still common to take some other form of transportation to those zones and then walk around.
[21:54:13] <manicennui> We have areas here that are great for just walking around (more so than even the average neighborhood), and they typically have tons of parking, and people drive there.
[21:54:36] <dimadima> gerikson: what about that comment
[21:55:04] <dimadima> unix time is an Instant
[21:55:11] <gerikson> it's amazingly dumb
[21:55:21] <gerikson> or rather, it just shifts the problem to someone else
[21:55:41] <dcz_> it's timezone-naive, I don't think it has a defined relationship to leap seconds, stuff like that
[21:55:41] <dimadima> in some contexts thats ok?
[21:56:25] <gerikson> dcz_: yeah Posix doesn't deal with leap seconds at all
[21:56:44] <gerikson> each day has 24*60*60 seconds, no more, no less
[21:56:47] <dimadima> if you can explain that would be nice
[21:56:58] <dimadima> so that i might be enlightened
[21:57:00] <gerikson> hence ugly hacks like time smearing
[21:59:00] <dimadima> manicennui: i like bob dylans take ultimately -- "it's life and life only"
[21:59:09] <dimadima> ppl will be fat or not fat, it's okay
[21:59:31] <manicennui> dimadima: I rather make an attempt to reduce human suffering.
[21:59:34] <dimadima> there are just so many internal and external factors
[21:59:50] <dimadima> yeah i agree
[21:59:55] <dcz_> some people enjoy suffering... they are annoying to be around
[21:59:57] <manicennui> dimadima: I think the vast majority of it in the US boils down to corporate profits.
[22:00:26] <manicennui> The answer to "why is this so fucked up?" or "why don't we change this?" is very often because we are protecting corporate profits.
[22:00:37] <dimadima> yeah
[22:00:40] <dcz_> and I don't mean that as a cheap nitpick, I mean that people would sacrifice good health for the ability to not have to constrain their diets
[22:01:12] <manicennui> And I'm not saying that we should focus on making every last human healthy, even if they want to be unhealty.
[22:01:23] <manicennui> I'm saying we should create the opportunity for everyone to become healthy.
[22:01:26] <manicennui> Access to healthcare.
[22:01:31] <manicennui> Not polluting the place.
[22:01:42] <manicennui> Walkable cities (for multiple reasons).
[22:02:30] <manicennui> Everyone seems to admit that advertising works, even if it is subconsciously, but then sees not problem with fast food chains being the most convenient option in so many places.
[22:02:41] <manicennui> And there are ways to deal with that without banning fast food.
[22:03:00] <manicennui> There is a neighborhood here that focused on allowing local businesses.
[22:03:10] <manicennui> They didn't have a McDonald's for the longest time, but they do now.
[22:03:19] <manicennui> But there aren't many fast food chains there generally.
[22:03:26] <manicennui> And there are a lot of great local shops.
[22:03:47] <manicennui> Chicago also prevented Walmart from being in the city for the longest time.
[22:04:11] <manicennui> We only have a couple of full-sized Walmarts now that are far from downtown.
[22:04:21] <manicennui> And several smaller Walmart express stores or something.
[22:04:40] <manicennui> We have several full sized Targets.
[22:05:51] <manicennui> When I watch videos about Amsterdam and Tokyo I realize how much further Chicago has to go though.
[22:05:54] <manicennui> And recently, Paris.
[22:06:08] <manicennui> But fuck, most of America is far worse.
[22:11:49] <ngoldbaum> wow did they nail it? https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1441829609553600517
[22:11:50] <buttsbot> Twatter - netflixgeeked - 3, 2, 1... let’s jam. Watch the opening credits for Cowboy Bebop, landing November 19th. #TUDUM https://t.co/LzZ8fqpVmD
[22:12:06] <ngoldbaum> i might even buy john cho as spike
[22:13:11] <dimadima> manicennui: sorry i have to do something but obviously this conversation is quite interesting
[22:15:10] <manicennui> Has there ever been a good live action adaptation of manga/anime?
[22:17:04] <ngoldbaum> clearly the first michael bay transformers
[22:17:06] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:17:34] *** Joins: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz)
[22:24:17] <manicennui> I think Old Boy is actually based on manga.
[22:24:42] <manicennui> Yeah, it is.
[22:24:48] <manicennui> That is probably about as good as it gets.
[22:24:56] <manicennui> But it also doesn't have supernatural elements, which helps.
[22:25:26] <manicennui> Apparently there is a live action Your Lie in April, but I haven't seen it.
[22:25:32] <manicennui> I can't imagine it measuring up to the anime.
[22:26:38] <manicennui> But that is the type of material that I think could be done well.
[22:32:01] <manicennui> Oh, Lone Wolf and Cub
[22:32:27] <ngoldbaum> wasn’t there a live action space battleship yamato
[22:41:40] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:41:52] <manicennui> Looks like it. Was it good?
[22:42:59] <manicennui> There is a live action Black Butler? Isn't that supposed to be borderline softcore porn?
[23:58:27] <gerikson> all the better as live action then...
