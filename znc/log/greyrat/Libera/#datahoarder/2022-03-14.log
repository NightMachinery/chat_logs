[00:28:47] <parted> Newpipe is great on mobile. skye0: most of the problems end up being 1. You are using the fdroid repo (which takes 2+ days to get updates) switch to the official newpipe repo. And 2. Your chosen quality setting isnt available for some videos.
[00:29:51] <parted> This happens to me when a video had 720p60 but doesn't seem to have 720p. Thus it will fail to load as "720p" doesn't seem to work

[01:28:29] <rawktucc> someone who has no command line skills, cannot get a GUI tool for youtube-dl working, and wants to download videos from youtube safely because they got viruses  from video download sites in the past

[03:44:21] <ThePendulum> hm with zfs did all my vdevs have to be the same size or just the disks within a vdev?
[03:45:01] <ThePendulum> so if I wanted to expand my NAS, could I merge 8x 12TB into an existing 8x 8TB pool 
[03:45:02] <Selavi> within vdev. to not waste space, anyway
[03:45:31] <Selavi> yes
[03:46:21] <evilgohan2> Wonder what happened to people like ShaRose and Mundus
[03:47:37] <Selavi> indeed. lot of peeps wandered off. I don't open up hexchat most days recently as well
[03:48:48] *** Quits: tex (~dix@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:49:04] <ThePendulum> I could have a 8x 12TB raidz2 vdev and a 8x 8TB raidz2 vdev in a pool and they would appear as the same storage space?
[03:49:27] <ThePendulum> I'm still puzzled how new people keep finding IRC. tbf I forgot how I found IRC
[03:51:08] <Selavi> correct. pools are block level. datasets are filesystem and automatically use all pool space, excepting things like quota obviously
[03:53:08] <ThePendulum> trying to think what I was concerned about when I decided to get 8x 8TB at once instead of 4x 8TB and then another 4x 8TB when it turned out I needed it
[03:53:24] <ThePendulum> of course that would've only taken 2 weeks but I thought it was some zfs quirk
[03:53:39] <Selavi> probably parity efficiency or risk of loss
[03:54:43] <Selavi> zfs isn't suited terribly well to expansion, so best to start big and keep it there if the end goal is mass storage
[03:55:17] <rawktucc> ^
[03:55:28] <rawktucc> that's why im going just one pool for my server
[03:55:34] <rawktucc> and split into whatever the individual shares are called
[03:55:40] <rawktucc> I have clients and personal
[04:04:46] <evilgohan2> I'm just waiting to see if 14TB easyStores will drop again in price
[04:04:53] <evilgohan2> if they do, I'll take the hit, and splurge on 7x
[04:04:58] <evilgohan2> Might have to go to multiple best buys to do it.
[04:06:32] <Selavi> my 24x 4TB is only 4/7 full and still holding out, but I would like to downsize to like 8-12 drives and a smaller chassis
[04:07:23] <evilgohan2> My 3x8TB had a disk fail, so that's in a degraded state. I just haven't bothered to replace it as I have different plans for the 2 disks. My music 2x4 RAID1 is almost full so I wanna replace it with that 2x 8 instead.
[04:07:34] <evilgohan2> My 5x 4TB is pretty much maxed
[04:07:47] <evilgohan2> My 8x 4TB is pretty much tapped out
[04:08:37] <evilgohan2> and I've got a Synology I got from old company with 10x 2TB Enterprise drives in it that could really be put to use doing other stuff. But it's serving as a tide over. I have another Synology I got dirt cheap with 7 empty bays in it just waiting.
[04:09:35] <Selavi> heh quite the spread of arrays
[04:11:16] <evilgohan2> its an awful mess
[04:11:55] <Selavi> I still need to do something with my 4x3TB baby server that died from the Atom C2000 bug. at least I think it has 3TB drives. been years since it's been used at this point

[21:54:11] <vuori> that's the same fucky ATA bus error I was seeing on 5.10 a couple of days ago, as far as I can tell it had no effect on data and originated from the controller side
[21:55:24] <fmstrat> vuori: That's good to hear. That server is on kernel 5.4, it's due for an update
[21:56:34] <fmstrat> vuori: I'm going to wait for the repair to finish, then run a long SMART test on one of the failed disks and try clearing errors on it, then go through and do that disk-by-disk (since I've got two failures in a zraid2)
[21:56:35] <vuori> I was trying to get rid of Ubuntu kernels, as soon as I put in mainline 5.10 that has been running fine elsewhere I started getting pretty much the same error on writes (lvm+btrfs). after I restored Ubuntu 5.13: no errors
[21:59:35] <vuori> same drives (ST8000, ST10000) had been running on my old server with 5.4 since forever with no problems. swapping cables and ports just changed what drives were seeing errors
[22:01:08] <fmstrat> Good to know. Thanks for the input!
[22:01:32] <fmstrat> I may run badblocks to be safe, too, but since I have 2 failures I really want to get one up and running again
