[00:00:33] <ghostbuster> hmm so digitalocean abuse form asks for your full name and email and says that it may be given to customer :-/
[00:01:14] <Stefan26> I only just found this channel by chance, so I don't know what's typically discussed here... I've worked as a software developer for various companies with varying degrees of security-awareness :) I'm no security expert myself, but I think it's interesting
[00:01:30] <ghostbuster> welcome
[00:03:58] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[00:04:11] <Stefan26> thanks, ive worked for some large financial institutions like large banks/stock exchanges... they have had solid processes for enforcing security at various levels... but also at the cost of high bureaucrazy... strong info-sec departments requiring sign-offs for stuff... but I've worked for medium sized companies where security has been an issue cause it hasn't been clear whose responsibility
[00:04:11] <Stefan26> it is... like devsecops on the paper, but many teams having developers with very little security awareness
[00:04:40] <Stefan26> it's challenging... what are your guys experience? you work mostly with software/application/web security or what brought you here?
[00:05:39] <ghostbuster> i prefer small companies
[00:07:18] *** Joins: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[00:08:19] <ghostbuster> and i prefer the technical side of security to the compliance stuff
[00:08:25] <Stefan26> yeah me too (I think)... but security is so difficult... if I do everything myself it's very hard to "prove" produced system is secure, and smaller companies typically don't budget paying for substantial security tests/expertise
[00:08:52] <ghostbuster> luckily the cost of cyber-insurance is skyrocketing..
[00:08:59] <Stefan26> so I not being an expert myself end up cutting corners to get business features out quicker

[15:52:51] <euouae> I just read a headline `Messenger’s end-to-end encrypted chats and calls are available to everyone`

[15:59:35] <euouae> labrador for example in the whitepaper it states "Each device manages various cryptographic keys. All keys are generated or derived on-device. Private keys are never sent to Facebook."
[15:59:37] <labrador> Well I read a quote on a site that went 'The NSA kills people based on metadata'. I could find the source for it
[15:59:43] <labrador> But I don't wanna nother
[15:59:46] <labrador> bother*
[15:59:53] <euouae> Notice that 1) it does not say that the keys are not shared elsewhere, just facebook. 2) It's a whitepaper, so it's not legally binding.
[16:00:26] <labrador> yeah
[16:00:41] <euouae> so it's a pretty slick trick when your whitepaper claims the keys are not shared, but you share them anyway, me thinks

[16:07:44] <euouae> OK well if you're just looking for an answer, they're not secure
[16:08:50] <euouae> e.g. netqmail was a continuation of qmail-1.03 that included bugfixes, so that tells you that the last qmail version at least had bugs. Also, writing C code without bugs is almost impossible.
[16:08:52] <MatSharrow> why and how?   and what about the qmail architecture, of lots of little small programs
[16:09:29] <euouae> C is Cursed, it's just how it is
[16:10:08] <euouae> plus whatever crypto was being used in 2005 is probably insecure now
[16:10:12] <labrador> Yeah c code for servers is a bad idea
[16:11:07] <MatSharrow> I'm more concerned with the architecture than language.  The reason I ask is I'm planning to create a server based application and i'm trying to build security into the design and I thought qmail was a good example of that (even thought it's very old).
[16:14:55] <euouae> well like I said netqmail included bugfixes for the latest version of qmail

[18:26:47] <xx> I don't understand
[18:26:53] <quas[m]> xx: most probably 4K
[18:27:06] <ajak> ed25519 keys aren't RSA-sized
[18:27:09] <xx> quas[m]: well I got it as 48bytes, but don't know if that's right
[18:27:24] <ajak> why not?
[18:27:26] <xx> ed25519 is supposed to be a standard, so I'd expect a standard size
[18:27:27] <Affliction> my private key is 400, authorized_keys line is 94
[18:27:37] <xx> I mean the actual key material
[18:27:41] <xx> not any of the metadata around it
[18:27:43] <ajak> xx: standardized key algorithms can be variable size

[18:27:55] <websec> ^ dpaste: $ du -bh <(tail -6 .ssh/id_ed25519 | head -5);
[18:27:59] <MadCamel> you can generate keys of different lengths. though I think openssh is hardcoded to 256 bits? Then base64 encodes it so it'd be a bit bigger on disk
[18:27:59] <ajak> mine is 64 bytes
[18:28:03] <quas[m]> so you cannot write something smaller than that.
[18:28:03] <quas[m]> xx: it will take up at least 512 Bytes, but on modern disks normally 4K. Because that's the disk sector.
[18:28:10] <xx> ajak: are you sure that's not base64 encoded?
[18:28:23] <xx> because 48bytes gets to 64bytes when base64 encoded
[18:28:24] <MadCamel> also quas[m]'s answer is really smart. a lot of filesystems have a minimum file size
[18:28:32] <quas[m]> xx: what I'm saying is not related to metadata. It's about how data is split in sectors.
[18:28:53] <ajak> right so we can say all small files are 4k..
[18:28:56] <Affliction> well, can't speak about container/metadata/encoding
[18:28:58] <ajak> and that's unhelpful
[18:28:59] <xx> quas[m]: yeah I wrote it wrong, I just said on-disk size so that people don't confuse it with 2048bit rsa kind of stuff
[18:29:06] <Affliction> But, you asked for "actual on-disk size" so... 400/94
[18:30:00] <quas[m]> ajak: not strictly unhelpful. It depends on the context, of course. If you have 1 billion separate files with ssh keys on them, then that's quite helpful. You'll probably have 1 bill * 4K.
[18:30:09] <Affliction> ajak: unless you use the feature that packs small files within the inode!
[18:30:15] <quas[m]> If you have all the keys within a single file, then ok, that could be unhelpful.
[18:30:19] <Affliction> or you're using a fs with tail packing!
[18:30:23] <Affliction> or a fs with a different block size!
[18:30:31] <xx> well then I meant "what's the size of the key material of a ed25519 key"

[18:31:03] <xx> there shouldn't be any variability in it, because there's only one ed25519 standard
[18:31:13] <quas[m]> I suppose you can count the characters and find out

[18:31:32] <xx> quas[m]: I don't know how much of it is the actual key material, and how much of it is the metadata
[18:31:41] <xx> metadata being stuff like "this is an ed25519 key"
[18:31:49] <quas[m]> are you talking about the private key or the public key?

[18:31:53] <xx> indicated by e.g. the first byte being 1
[18:32:03] <xx> private key
[18:32:05] <quas[m]> in my case it's 419
[18:32:10] <quas[m]> bytes

[18:33:44] <quas[m]> well, normally the public key and the private key belong to different files, and that's clear. If you have them together for some reason (for example some web servers like nginx need that for certificates - although certificates still use rsa), then, sure, you have to identify the limits.
[18:33:49] <Affliction> signatures contain 2 32 byte parts - so, 64 bytes
[18:34:03] <quas[m]> so big as what?
[18:36:09] <Affliction> private key (a and RH) is 64 bytes, public key (A) is 32 bytes
[18:36:19] <quas[m]> I'm not sure how you got to that. my private ed25519 key is 419 characters long.

[18:37:36] <Affliction> my authorized_keys line is 94
[18:37:51] <xx> but I don't know if those 48bytes are just the key, or if it includes other stuff beyond the key material
