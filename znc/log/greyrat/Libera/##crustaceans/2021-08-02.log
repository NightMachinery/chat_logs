[16:46:01] <prussian> I too, wish to go back to 2002.
[16:46:08] <prussian> I have a lot of choices to reevaluate.
[16:46:11] <prussian> see you then.
[16:49:30] <prussian> >*snip* and I hate to say it, global warming causing the earth to speed up, unexpectedly.
[16:49:38] <prussian> that's... interesting to know.
[16:56:27] <Brekkjern> Well, AFAIK, the rotational speed of the earth varies a bit depending on several factors
[16:56:43] <Brekkjern> Climate change was new to me, but I knew it wasn't constant
[16:58:09] <prussian> ya, I'm just trying to understand how that works.
[16:58:14] <prussian> in my mind.
[16:58:24] <prussian> *not denying climate change*
[16:58:37] <Brekkjern> Didn't say you were :)
[16:59:16] <Brekkjern> I'm betting it's ice melting which shifts the weight closer to the centre of the earth, which increases the rate of rotation or something like that?
[16:59:33] <Brekkjern> Something like pulling your arms in while spinning
[16:59:46] <Brekkjern> But what the fuck do I know. I don't know physics for shit
[17:09:56] <prussian> makes sense I guess.
[17:10:03] <prussian> weird stuff lol
[17:10:24] <prussian> I forgot GPS time is some weird week based unit of time with constant rollovers as well.
[17:10:40] <prussian> well, wrapping overflow.
[17:17:12] <gerikson> I've larned that befoer then promptly forgot
[17:17:20] <gerikson> also GPS doesn't have leap seconds
[17:17:26] <gerikson> so I don't understand that issue
[17:18:55] <Brekkjern> gpsd and gps are two separate things
[17:19:06] <gerikson> ah! that explains it
[17:19:28] <Brekkjern> gpsd interprets a gps signal from a receiver and forwards it as a structured message
[17:19:54] <gerikson> and does the GPS time <-> UTC conversion?
[17:20:13] <Brekkjern> It seems so
[17:21:55] <Brekkjern> >gpsd can provide reference clock information to ntpd or chronyd, to keep the system clock synchronized to the time provided by the GPS receiver
[17:22:05] <prussian> looks like GPS includes an 8bit UTC offset though.
[17:25:33] <gerikson> I'd like to get a GPS reciever for my Pi
[17:25:39] <gerikson> they're not too expensive
[17:55:04] <gerikson> oh wait is GPSd ESR's project?
[17:56:10] <epilys> GPS is USA military
