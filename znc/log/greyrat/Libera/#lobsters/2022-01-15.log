[13:52:27] <boredcaveman> for every framework you found go to the respective documentation page, there should be a statement of what is its primary goal (single page app, fast development, general purpose ecc...)
[13:54:53] <bradfier> I mean, as an example, React says in its documentation “you can just add bits of react to your existing application!”
[13:55:06] <bradfier> But nowhere tells you how, the docs just launch straight into a huge SPA

[14:55:24] <albertito> bradfier: for my very small uses of js, and as someone who is not a fan of js, I've found typescript to be a big improvement over plain js
[14:55:50] <pe> Don't you need to transpile?
[14:55:59] <albertito> yes, I have a "make" and compile
[14:56:19] <albertito> well I have a Makefile, which runs the ts compiler, and then upload the result
[14:56:24] <bradfier> Yeah ideally I’d like to avoid the madness that is webpack
[14:56:32] <bradfier> But I guess if it’s simple?
[14:56:44] <albertito> bradfier: you don't need webpack, it compiles to a .js file

[14:57:57] <bradfier> Yeah part of the attraction is I’d like to use some of the packages available because then I don’t need to spend so much time implementing stuff I’m really not good at

[16:07:25] <vladimyr> bradfier: simple answer: webpack is bundler or "linker" for multiple things that can be compiled to js. These days you don't need big and complicated config to get you started and enable you to use stuff from npm
[16:08:07] <bradfier> That makes sense, and then my reading is you have 'loaders' which seem to be, for all intents and purposes, compilers?
[16:08:16] <vladimyr> However, if you still feel intimidated reading modern webpack tutorials I suggest you take a look at https://parceljs.org/
[16:08:17] <mockturtle> [ Parcel – The zero configuration build tool for the web. ] - parceljs.org
[16:08:46] <bradfier> i.e. loaders produce something akin to object code which then gets bundled by webpack?
[16:09:33] <vladimyr> Yes, loaders are essentially compilers or transpilers and you don't need many to start things up
[16:10:25] <vladimyr> They produce js that gets concatenated as one giant array that gets immediately invoked
[16:10:45] <vladimyr> Regarding your framework concern
[16:11:09] <vladimyr> If you need drag n drop or sort stuff
[16:11:47] <vladimyr> Those kind of things are typically implemented as framework independent libs, vanilla as they say
[16:12:51] <vladimyr> And you'll actually have more trouble finding good adapters for vue or react. tbh I'm coming from vue land so maybe react adapters are of better quality
[16:13:43] <bradfier> I see
[16:13:53] <vladimyr> So my advice is try going without framework
[16:14:00] <vladimyr> And check this out https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable
[16:14:01] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - SortableJS/Sortable: Reorderable drag-and-drop lists for modern browsers and touch devices. No jQuery or framework required. ] - github.com
[16:14:08] <vladimyr> Hope it works for you
[16:14:30] <bradfier> Thanks!
[16:15:19] <bradfier> To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if it might be quicker and easier to go with the path of least resistance and implement this specific pane as a mini-SPA
[16:15:23] <bradfier> Maybe with vue
[16:15:34] <vladimyr> Also you really can put react or vue on top of static page and I believe both frameworks tell you how to do it but it is probably buried deep down inside their docs
[16:16:18] <vladimyr> It depends :^)
[16:18:09] <vladimyr> Just be aware that as we speak vue is in pythonesque v2 vs v3 state where half of things don't work with new version and v3 isn't officially out of beta AFAIK
[16:18:23] <vladimyr> You are probably better going with react
[16:20:05] <bradfier> delightful
