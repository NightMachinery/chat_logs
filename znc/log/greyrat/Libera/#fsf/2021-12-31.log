[04:37:55] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: If you're only on your lan, then it's a private lan, so the only person to comply to the AGPLv3 to is yourself, which is already done.

[04:38:47] <yrk> natewrench123456: section 13 of AGPLv3 states: "interacting with it remotely through a computer network"

[04:39:13] <yrk> natewrench123456: it means exactly that. all none-local (that is, not within the same machine) network interaction
[04:39:39] <yrk> natewrench123456: but, also what DiffieHellman says
[04:40:05] <natewrench123456> its ambiguous thats all
[04:40:49] <yrk> natewrench123456: no, it is written in legal language. legal language is a domain specific language meant to "run" in the courtroom. it isn't ambiguous to the lawyers who wrote it, and won't be to the lawyers who will read it
[04:41:42] <yrk> natewrench123456: while there is an effort to make licenses also clear to the layman, that isn't the first priority. no more than making source code readable to non-programmers is the first priority of language designers
[04:44:17] <yrk> it is as unreasonable and unrealistic to make a copyright license in perfectly clear vernacular as it would be to write a program in plain vernacular speech; though if either were achievable, that would be nice
[04:45:00] <natewrench123456> in addition to the right to repair laws being passed, could that mean hardware freedom that GPLv3 has been promising with the anti tivo clause now requiring companies to disclose their hardware keys to unlock devices so people can repair them?
[04:45:44] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: A company must disclose any hardware key required to modify the software on the machine.
[04:46:36] <DiffieHellman> It doesn't need to be the root key for everything, a key that only works on x machine is fine as well, as long as the company is willing to generate per machine keys for every request.

[04:56:57] <DiffieHellman> Android was already plently locked down. Sure you could get most of it as free software, but on every device there is required proprietary software.

[05:29:13] <tpefreedom> natewrench123456, DiffieHellman, part of how locked down android is depends on what rom you are using (manufacturer skins vs stock vs most community-made roms)
[05:29:20] <Kaiod> Wow, I left here for a while and when I came back there are several messages. today the subject the subject of the room is interesting so haha 
[05:29:41] <tpefreedom> Or whether verified boot is enabled or whether the device is rooted etc
[05:32:12] <Kaiod> what are you really talking about?
[05:32:20] <Kaiod> About Android or booting from it?

[16:56:11] <easyme> DiffieHellman: ^
[16:56:22] <epony> and so, all new projects prefer not-using GPL anything
[16:56:32] <DiffieHellman> That's about a copyright disclaimer for a business.
[16:56:41] <epony> including CLANG/LLVM which is prefered because of the better license
[16:56:59] <DiffieHellman> If you're employed by a business, some contracts will say they own copyright on *all* you works, and this avoids any issues with hat.
[16:57:29] <epony> FSF wants you to use GPL licenses so it can force commercial services upon you for protections and litigation and distribution.
[16:57:37] <easyme> DiffieHellman: If I do not do business with software, then I do not need copyright disclaimer, right? I only need a AUTHORS file to list the developers name. right?
[16:58:02] <epony> FSF is funding GNU, which is a republishing house, that takes free work and relicense it by coercion and forced choices.
[16:58:13] <epony> EXACTLY LIKE YOU SEE ABOVE ^
[16:58:54] <DiffieHellman> Yep
[16:59:08] <epony> most software projects reject the GPL once they find out about BSD and MIT / ISC and other truelly free and permissive licenses
[16:59:27] <epony> even Linux project regrets using GPL
[17:00:01] <epony> (it was used for hype around software freedom debates, not because GPL is free and open)
[17:00:36] <epony> Free and Open are BSD distributions, and Net is their BSD legacy where it stems from BSD UNIX.
[17:00:52] <epony> these projects are the basis of most other software including GNU
[17:01:14] <kompowiec> I know only two reasons for their use of a permissive license:
[17:01:14] <kompowiec> 1. Companies want them
[17:01:19] <epony> just GNU chose to be more "hypey" and "market" more it's more "enforcing" and "protective" licensing models
[17:01:26] <kompowiec> 2. they confuse absolute freedom with negative freedom
[17:01:27] <easyme> If someone wants to make a open source software, will he need to use all open source library inside code?
[17:01:49] <labrador> yes
[17:01:49] <epony> businesses do not want license trolls like "GPL" clowns
[17:02:05] <labrador> but its not oss,its free software
[17:02:06] <epony> yet businesses pour many millions into Linux
[17:02:18] <epony> so Linux is a commercial project
[17:02:27] <epony> and yet it's GPL-ed, which is funny
[17:02:32] <kompowiec> I wonder why they didn't use BSD huh
[17:02:39] <epony> as by your incorrect words it would be BSD
[17:02:48] <epony> but it is GPL ;-)
[17:03:00] <epony> because it is not-UNIX but an inferior implementation originally
[17:03:06] <epony> "kid stuff"
[17:03:23] <epony> with the intent to give GPL and GPL-lic kernel
[17:03:40] <epony> so the GNU userland got a kernel, and could claim "donations"
[17:03:52] <kompowiec> i mean BSD operating systems
[17:03:53] <epony> prior to that it ran on.. nothing ;-) but real UNIX
[17:04:38] <epony> so GNU is a UNIX userland that is done incorrectly and non-standardised, but it was popular because of hype and marketing and quarrels online and it's false promises of freedoms that are restrictions
[17:04:42] <darwin> some major BSD Unix people said they regretted not listening to FSF and using GPL

[17:05:48] <epony> BSD people do not care about the GPL
[17:06:03] <epony> as they are an earlier project that liberated and freed UNIX to everyone
[17:06:07] <easyme> Is KDE open source project?
[17:06:13] <easyme> KDE uses qt
[17:06:27] <easyme> qt is commercial also gpl3 included
[17:06:35] <epony> and extended it with the TCP and VM and SOCKETS and 32bit systems
[17:06:57] <epony> 'nobody cares about QT / GTK debates'
[17:07:00] <epony> it's all X
[17:07:15] <epony> the rest are userland libraries and toolkits that are pseudo-commercial crapware
[17:08:08] <epony> none of the OSes include X originally, it's an external project and comes from the commercial side of UNIX
[17:08:24] <easyme> So if someone makes an open source software with qt, and adds COPYING with gpl3, will it be open source free software?
[17:08:35] <epony> which was released for free by various X/Open people piece by piece

[17:09:36] <epony> from the mid-90ies
[17:09:47] <epony> stale and obsolete, morally obsolete and useless information
[17:10:39] <epony> there is no commercial UNIX since the 90ies, and you'd have no Linux if it was not commerce trying to stop the already free BSD UNIX
[17:10:54] <darwin> it's not obsolete; it's something easyme needs to read. Here we are for Free/Libre Software, not Open Source
[17:11:21] <epony> so commerce 1) funds Linux 2) stops BSD UNIX which is free 3) pays the FSF to install licenses that stop any software being used by free UNIX
[17:11:28] <epony> dude
[17:11:36] <epony> the OSI/FSF debate is gone in the past
[17:11:38] <epony> forget it
[17:11:43] <epony> OSI was fake
[17:12:13] <epony> also commerce is closer to GPL / GNU
[17:12:38] <darwin> no, it's closer to permissive licenses (like some BSD ones)
[17:12:43] <epony> and does no like BSD because BSD is more open and can not be used to limit people and create artificial scarcity
[17:12:48] <epony> BULLSHIT
[17:12:56] <epony> trade secret / commerce is on the right

[17:54:50] <epony> while GPL* is incapable of that, and is a service to MONOPOLIES and TRADE
[17:54:58] <epony> that's why it is on the right, get it?
[17:55:22] <epony> you have to think more, not just from the perspective of your own "republisher" forced services model
[17:55:24] <darwin> it's the opposite
[17:55:28] <epony> but as a whole, about HUMANITY
[17:56:32] <epony> darwin, nobody believes Apple is philantropic, neither is Microsoft, and neither is Google and Amazon
[17:58:08] <epony> the corporations want free software groups to be poking each other eyes with licensing quarrels instead of competing with them
[17:58:25] <epony> instead of providing high quality software that eliminates the need for commercial vendors
[17:58:52] <epony> that is why they sponsore HUGELY the licenses that do not threaten their existence and generate higher dependence and weaker independence
[17:59:02] <epony> you will eventually learn things ;-)
[18:00:28] <epony> you really really REALLY want all licenses removed and all work freed and liberated and release as high quality open and free data and source (resources) in reproducible forms, so you can forever forget about commercial software
[18:01:06] <darwin> http://techrights.org/2020/09/15/rmsf/
[18:01:27] <epony> what you get in reality is some projects that create free and sustainable software stacks that threatens the domination of commerce, and then you get a second tier of less threatening more conservative and protective (restrictive) licenses
[18:01:46] <darwin> 'Unfortunately, Richard Stallman, the author of the GPL and quite an interesting individual lived at 5405 DEC square, he lived up on the sixth floor I think? Had an office up there; he did not have an apartment. And we knew him extremely well. He was a challenging individual to get along with. He would regularly come down to our offices and ask us, or kind of rail at us, for not using the GPL.
[18:01:46] <darwin> This did not make a positive impression on me, this was my first interactions with Richard directly and I remember thinking at the time, “this guy is a little, you know, I’m not interested in talking to him because he’s so challenging to work with.”
[18:01:46] <darwin> And so, we should have listened to him then but we did not because, we know him too well, I guess, and met him as well.
[18:01:46] <darwin> He really was right, we need to remember that!'--Keith Packard (of X11)
[18:02:32] <epony> RMS is cool, he just did "a business" service to big businesses.
[18:02:56] <darwin> “It’s true. John Gillmore & Richard Stallman convinced me that opening up the sources was worthwhile, we wouldn’t have done that without their urging.”--Keith Bostic (third person hired to work on BSD in the early days)
[18:02:59] <epony> and created a publishing house taking "free software" and releasing it under "his terms and conditions"
[18:03:31] <epony> darwin, that's a lie
[18:03:39] <darwin> it's in that article--read it
[18:03:49] <epony> because UNIX was created by AT&T and given to universities in source form
[18:03:53] <DiffieHellman> Yes, rms played a large part in improving computing in the past and still is,
[18:03:59] <epony> you can stop spamming articles ;-)
[18:04:00] <darwin> yes, then they added onto it
[18:04:26] <epony> the actually rewrote and completely superseded UNIX with BSD
[18:04:45] <epony> and gave back a lot (everything to AT&T and Bell Labs)

[18:05:30] <DiffieHellman> "RMS Really IS The Father of “Open Source”" - yes it was sperm stolen from him. He wants people to release and use free software, not just "open source" software.
[18:05:31] <epony> just kept giving it for free to others since they had the modifications that people wanted (the Internet, NET packages for BSD UNIX) were free
[18:05:43] <epony> that's wrong and also silly
[18:06:11] <epony> the free software was provided by large vendors like IBM and DEC (Digital) with their expensive hardware
[18:06:54] <epony> and that software was also given for free access to Universities and were mandated to educate people to use it and extend it so commerce had something to improve and sell further
[18:07:30] <epony> so the 80ies took off with the mini and micro-computers (personal computers)
[18:07:50] <epony> and they were too insufficient to run UNIX and had to run adapted smaller variants
[18:08:28] <epony> but instead of using a mini-UNIX they were shipped with that crap you know as DOS which is a clone of CP/M which is an adaptation of UNIX-like to small machines
[18:08:52] <epony> so.. PCs could not really run UNIX, they were however excellent terminals to UNIX

[18:11:21] <epony> it was people from Bell Labs that went to Berkeley to cooperate on the BSD project (Ken and others)
[18:12:14] <epony> RMS went to ask for software which he could resell (use) for his new project as a jobless (sacked from a Lisp "symbolics" company that went bankrupt and cancelled with the AI winter)
[18:12:25] <epony> so he was told to fuck off
[18:12:56] <epony> or otherwise, use the software whatever way he wants (the license just said he can not "relicense" and "claim he wrote it")

[19:07:59] <White_Flame> no, I mean the specific problem of hiding if a freenet node has all the pieces of a particular file, which would implicate them in intentionally downloading it
[19:08:26] <DiffieHellman> Oh well.
[19:08:26] <White_Flame> but yeah, it's something to worry about if you're going to be legally targeted
[19:08:35] <labrador> bittorrent is nice for p2p downloads
[19:08:39] <White_Flame> not if you're just doing your privacy enthusiast personal site, etc

[19:09:42] <DiffieHellman> Sadly it doesn't even do encryption properly (RC4 is the encryption algorithm).
[19:09:42] <White_Flame> and bittorrent's best resilience feature is that it does not offer a searchable index
[19:09:43] <ggoes> i'm fond of sneakernet

[19:11:16] <labrador> There are DHT search engines so it must be possible
[19:11:21] <slips> DiffieHellman: You could just encrypt the file before sending it, no?

[19:12:12] <White_Flame> labrador: because computer people worship legacy ;)
[19:12:14] <DiffieHellman> i2p's default client sucks, but there's ip2d, which is C++, so it still sucks, but less.

[19:13:15] <DiffieHellman> Java is best for writing utter garbage, yes
[19:13:23] <epony> java is proprietary
[19:13:23] <labrador> Java would have a much less attack surface
[19:13:33] <epony> that's incorrect
[19:13:36] <labrador> epony you really spew out misinfo
[19:13:40] <DiffieHellman> You have to be _very_ skilled to write Java that isn't complete garbage.
[19:13:58] <White_Flame> java's own internal security boundaries are often weak, too
[19:14:00] <labrador> No,java being memory safe means its more secure to write daemons in
[19:14:02] <epony> labrador, kids have to learn when to read and receive less criticism for being clueless
[19:14:08] <slips> Java is a dumpster fire and i'm surprised we still haven't phased it out
[19:14:13] <epony> labrador, wrong
[19:14:17] <labrador> no u
[19:14:22] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, Java has problems with the loading of class's willy nilly and methods that do too many things
[19:14:25] <epony> labrador, step outside
[19:14:29] <White_Flame> I recall you could use java introspection stuff to get around its security containers, though that's probably long fixed
[19:14:50] <labrador> epony why do you personally attack instead of attacking the argument
[19:14:51] <slips> labrador: Java isn't the *only* language that's memory safe
[19:15:02] <DiffieHellman> The Log4j thing is pretty much Java defined.
[19:15:21] <slips> Rust is memory safe isn't it?
[19:15:22] <White_Flame> what was the nature of the log4j bug?  I never looked into it
[19:15:28] <DiffieHellman> Memory safety is a meme. The only way to be sure is to apply a mathematical proof over your problem.

[19:33:32] <DiffieHellman> System76 sells hardware that doesn't work without the intel ME though.

[19:36:16] <labrador> DiffieHellman, lmao ARM doesnt even have UEFI or a similar standard. First try to get your system booted on it before worrying about anything else

[19:36:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> also RISC-V
[19:36:27] <labrador> Power10 is nice

[19:36:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> UEFI is bloated garbage last time i checked
[19:36:39] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Sure, but libreboot has been ported to ARM.
[19:36:47] <epony> that's really not correct, since those are IBM hardware that is both expensive and sold under contract and with software (commercial UNIX)
[19:36:54] <DiffieHellman> POWER10 isn't compatible with freedom.
[19:37:00] <labrador> M6piz7wk[m], its not garbage if it provides a stable interface
[19:37:02] <epony> absolutely, IBM is out
[19:37:12] <DiffieHellman> Those RAM chips need firmware to be loaded onto them.
[19:37:15] <labrador> Atleast it give gnu/linux a chance to boot
[19:37:24] <labrador> Compete fairly with other systems
[19:37:29] <DiffieHellman> UEFI could have easily be not garbage, but they made a few choices.

[19:55:35] <epony> work on improving your preferred software and teaching others how to participate is good enough of a start, fighting is probably just words anyway

[20:08:27] <kompowiec> hey craigt, what do you think, using wikidata will be better software for free software directory? I mean, in most cases someone finds a program X. I check if it is free or not, if it is not, I look for an replacement. It works in alternativeto.net perfectly but is imperfect - when I edited this site, I added software to the categories and of course the list of replacements was empty, but it was enough to add 2-3 programs and 
[20:08:27] <kompowiec> the list was populated with applications that were related to those other programs. I don't think it currently exists, but wikidata would probably do the job.
[20:09:16] <kompowiec> currently in free software directory it's almost impossible searching for software by names of proprietary programs that someone would like to replace.

[20:15:11] <labrador> thats what alternative.to is for

[20:18:46] <kompowiec> labrador, indeed but alternativeto.net isn't libre site
[20:19:13] <kompowiec> and has this imperfection (probably, I would have to check what it looks like now)

[20:26:13] <kompowiec> the easiest way to fix this would be to add some software avoid table and it would be enough for it to appear in the search results.
