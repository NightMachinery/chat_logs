[04:18:05] <Rohambili> Hi People! ü§óü§™ 
[04:20:40] <Rohambili> 1:33 de. DEPRECATED OPTION: --cipher set to 'AES-256-CBC' but missing in --data-ciphers (AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305). OpenVPN ignores --cipher for cipher negotiations. What is this means? In my ovpn file needs to adjust something? 
[04:22:00] <Rohambili> OpenVPN for android show this, but connected to my vpn server. But witndows OpenVPN Gui just gives an error message and wrote almost the same in the log file
[04:22:25] <xx> yes, openvpn config file needs adjusting so that it works in future versions
[04:25:38] <Rohambili> how to search this in google or OPenvpn website to get what i want? How to add --data-ciphers to ovpn 
[04:37:13] <Rohambili> "ncp-disable" ?
[04:38:48] <Rohambili> man i read a one year old forum.. Why does not fix this ? O.o
[04:43:54] <xx> Rohambili: do you know how to edit openvpn client config files?
[04:44:10] <Rohambili> O.o notepad++
[04:44:12] <xx> if yes, then you just add AES-256-CBC to what is already in --data-ciphers in that file
[04:44:22] <Rohambili> i guess not
[04:44:29] <xx> so that it looks something like --data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305:AES-256-CBC
[04:44:42] <BtbN> If you can, don't use CBC cipers anymore
[04:44:44] <xx> also, don't use ncp-disable, it's been removed
[04:44:45] <BtbN> they're considered broken
[04:45:02] <xx> they've been broken way before openvpn realized they were broken
[04:45:16] <xx> openvpn is lagging about 10 years behind best security practices
[04:45:22] <BtbN> ...?
[04:45:29] <BtbN> It supports GCM just fine. Since a long time.
[04:45:34] <xx> BtbN: BF-CBC default in 2020?
[04:45:38] <xx> please
[04:45:53] <BtbN> The default is auto-negotiations, which will pick AES-256-GCM if you don't specify anything else.
[04:46:23] <Rohambili> almost the end cipher AES-256CBC
[04:46:35] <xx> yeah, but when autonegotiation doesn't work or is disabled, it would still fall back all the way to BF-CBC with just a warning and not an error
[04:46:51] <xx> i.e. something that was removed from mainstream software all the way back in tls1.0
[04:46:58] <xx> 17 years ago?
[04:48:05] <xx> openvpn has improved recently, but boy did it take decades to get it right
[04:48:18] <BtbN> If auto-negotiations fails the other side is so damn old it doesn't support GCM

[04:54:25] <Rohambili> xx I add your line to ovpn but now i get this:
[04:54:25] <Rohambili> cannot preload keyfile (ta.key) Exiting due to fatal error:sleepy:
[04:55:24] <xx> Rohambili: you might have messed up something in that file while editing it then
[04:56:13] <xx> ideally one would use <tls-auth>-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----xxx-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----</tls-auth> in the file
[04:56:26] <xx> instead of giving a path to the ta.key file
[05:16:41] <Rohambili> i added all to key crt  to  &userprofile/OpenVPN/config/myusername directory Not works, then added the exact location in the config file C:/userprofile/OpenVPN/config/myusername   Guess what?
[05:19:36] <Rohambili> im just tired ü§™ dont see üßê
[05:24:35] <xx> Rohambili: this is how a basic client.ovpn file should look these days https://0x0.st/-hgc.txt
[05:24:47] <xx> note the things in <> at the end
[05:26:08] <xx> a single file is needed, no messing with a config file and then the various other keyfiles
[05:37:13] <Rohambili> now try to connect In windows
[05:37:13] <Rohambili>  TLS Key negotation failed 
[05:37:13] <Rohambili> TLS Handshake failed... 
[05:37:13] <Rohambili> Android: 
[05:37:13] <Rohambili> Waiting for the server answer I guess i go to bad. Thank you for your time:pray:
[06:09:17] <KNERD> valdikss: seems like all VPN services
[06:09:37] <valdikss> KNERD: ?
[06:10:32] <KNERD> https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73968.htm
[06:18:44] <valdikss> KNERD: yes
[06:22:36] <KNERD> going to block it, or just say prohibited?
[06:22:52] <KNERD> China bans VPN, but really does not enforce it
[06:26:07] <valdikss> KNERD: they probably will block the websites, not sure about the servers.
[06:27:19] <valdikss> KNERD: right now there's some kind of Tor blocking test in Moscow, you can follow here: https://ntc.party/t/ooni-reports-of-tor-blocking-in-certain-isps-since-2021-12-01/1477
[06:30:08] <KNERD> ok. thanks

[08:27:20] <ozzloy> i just created a vpn on my raspberry pi
[08:27:49] <ozzloy> actually, i'm helping someone else
[08:28:27] <ozzloy> it looks like it's all set up, they've set up the raspberry pi, it has openvpn up and running, he installed openvpn client on his windows machine, the opened the vpn
[08:28:41] <ozzloy> it looks like he connected his machine to his pi
[08:28:55] <ozzloy> it says there is traffic flowing
[08:29:05] <ozzloy> but i don't know how to check what traffic is flowing
[08:29:15] <ozzloy> or how to direct some traffic to go through the vpn

[08:33:15] *** ciphersalad is now known as bedroller
[08:57:00] <ozzloy> how do we direct all traffic through the raspberry pi
[09:00:37] <ozzloy> he gets assigned the ip 10.8.0.2 and it looks like there is _some_ traffic flowing, but it's a very small amount.  just a few megabytes over 1/2 hour
[09:00:57] <ozzloy> so there's no way his traffic is going through the vpn
[09:01:04] <ozzloy> because he's doing a video call with me
[09:06:22] <ozzloy> oh, maybe his video connection with me is already established and so is not going through the vpn.  we just tried downloading ubuntu iso and the download size was about the size of the amount of traffic going through the vpn!
[10:27:06] *** Joins: nerozero (~nerozero@87.253.63.54)
[12:33:35] <ordex> ozzloy: it all depends on the routing table. are you pushing 'redirect-gateway def1' ? that will tell clients to configure a default route through the vpn
[12:33:42] <ordex> resulting in *all* traffic going through it

[16:22:07] <Rohambili> Hello masters! Please help me out.  I want to configure my Openvpn server, which is configured like this: https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Debian_11&p=openvpn&f=1
[16:22:07] <Rohambili> So i can connect, the server and for xmple i can ssh-in without open port22 from the internet.
[16:22:07] <Rohambili> I want the clients use my servers, dns server, and internet  connection. So rerouting the clients traffic. 
[16:22:07] <Rohambili> How can i search, what am i searching? Maybe someone can give me a usefull link to a how-to what i need? 
[16:22:07] <Rohambili> BTW Im on Debian 11
