[04:55:10] <tinwhiskers> Hi www13. This channel is primarily for discussion about the English language, not an English chat channel and as such we prefer people don't use shortened versions of words like 'u' and 'r' in place of the full words.
[04:55:27] <tinwhiskers> However, I'm from New Zealand. What about you?
[04:55:43] <www13> china
[04:55:53] <tinwhiskers> Ah. Nice. Welcome.
[04:56:22] <tinwhiskers> How long have you been speaking English?
[04:57:45] <www13> we learn it from primary school, so maybe 12 years
[04:57:59] <tinwhiskers> As to your other question, libera is the largest irc network by quite a margin. See https://netsplit.de/networks/top10.php
[04:58:22] <tinwhiskers> ah. ok. And have you travelled outside China at all yet?
[04:58:49] *** Joins: totenkoph (~scythe@user/totenkoph)
[04:58:54] <www13> not yet. how about you?
[04:59:44] <tinwhiskers> I've been a few places but want to come over to East Asia soon - I'm waiting on covid to get its game together.
[05:01:15] <www13> great! thanks for your answer to my first question
[05:02:01] <tinwhiskers> actually in terms of servers libera isn't the largest network, but it is in number of users and channels.

[05:04:44] <www13> all right
[05:06:11] <www13> do you know why libera.chat defeat freenode from June according to the chart?
[05:09:26] <www13> --in user number and channel number
[05:09:34] <bin_bat> because freenode deleted all accounts and then forced sasl connections
[05:09:53] <bin_bat> so most people who were idling got disconnected as the servers shut down and they switched to another ircd
[05:12:57] <www13> ah. but why freenode did that?
[05:13:45] <bin_bat> because it was taken over by a narcissistic madman named Andrew Lee
[05:14:41] <www13> hahaha

[19:45:27] <Guest50> Hi! I have a question about a bit weird English sentence. Basically I'm not sure if it is correct. Here it is: "Knowledge and successful appliance of OOP paradigm". Is it correct to usag "appliance" in that context? I always thought that "appliance" is some sort of equipment, like kitchen appliance. What is meant there is that a person knows OOP
[19:45:28] <Guest50> paradigm and can apply it correctly.

[22:28:06] <dfcnvt> What is the word that mean...A person who consumed an overtly range of experience and its practice through bravery is no longer the senses or the feeling of being brave but being presence fearlessly?
[22:29:59] <dfcnvt> I think the word "bravery" made all the more sense if it's being used by the young people...or rather by the inexperienced people describing the type of a person whose attribution goes with it 'bravery'.  Does that make sense?

[23:37:14] <tinwhiskers> dfcnvt: nope. It doesn't make sense to me.
[23:38:31] <tinwhiskers> "A person who consumed an overtly range of experience and its practice through bravery is no longer the senses or the feeling of being brave but being presence fearlessly" is frankly just word soup. Try explaining it again from the start using different words.
[23:41:54] <tinwhiskers> I think you're saying bravery is only something naive/inexperienced people experience?
[23:43:27] <tinwhiskers> I would just say it's not necessarily young people, but anyone experiencing something new that is outside their previous experience who lack confidence, and experienced people are more confident.
