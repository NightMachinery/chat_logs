[00:19:15] <buu> wait
[00:19:20] <buu> Is there a usable perl language server now?
[00:19:35] <buu> Because Perl::LS sucks
[00:20:08] <Bscan_> Ha. I think the Perl Navigator is very usable, but I'm clearly biased.
[00:20:40] <LeoNerd> No, because I haven't had time to start one and actually make it any good
[00:20:42] <LeoNerd> People can help
[00:20:50] <buu> o.O
[00:20:51] <LeoNerd> It'll get done quicker if they do
[00:24:43] <Bscan_> LeoNerd, the Language Server I just released uses your work (e.g. Sub::Util) and uses compiler results instead of trying to parse with PPI. I find it far more effective than the prior two language servers. If you have any suggestions or are looking for help, count me in.
[00:25:50] <Bscan_> Perl::LanguageServer uses Coro, so was always destined to have issues.

[01:08:51] <gloin> gordonfish: it's implicit, righ. Sigh
[01:09:05] <buu> Bscan_: Is there a way to run it as a standalone server communicating over stdin/stdout with just basic lsp stuff?
[01:10:08] <Bscan_> Yes, you can download the vsix, and run the server.js file with --stdio. One of my coworkers got it working in emacs lsp-mode that way.
[01:10:41] <buu> Bscan_: vsix is the .. whole bundle of code?
[01:10:51] <buu> Like what you get from github clone ?

[01:10:57] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Using coc extensions · neoclide/coc.nvim Wiki · GitHub ]
[01:12:24] <Bscan_> vsix is packaged up, so probably removes some unnecessary code from the repo. I package it up including all Perl dependencies to make it trivial to install in vscode (compared to Perl::LanguageServer which is a nightmare). I'd like to figure out a similar process for vim and emacs as well
[01:12:59] <gloin> @cronpath = split (':', s/^PATH=//r) if ($_ =~ /^PATH/); # win
[01:13:16] <buu> Bscan_: ts-node src/server.ts  --stdio ?
[01:14:01] <Bscan_> I run the compiled javascript from the vsix, but that probably works too
[01:15:38] <buu> hm
[01:16:32] <buu> Bscan_: your vsix is a bit weird
[01:17:14] <buu> https://clbin.com/LAv4b
[01:17:53] <buu> Bscan_: did you mean to have server/src/*.ts and server/out/*.js ?

[08:49:57] <gordonfish> Man wtf are the heads of AT&T wireless thinking... suspending the services of people just because they are killing 3G, even though a huge amount of those people are using phones that work and have been working just fine on 4G LTE, for voice and data, and even 5G (even if just Lowband)... it's really insane.
[08:51:04] <gordonfish> Apparently they IMEIs need to be on an approved list, something that wasn't a case for 3G and 4G previously (though one did have to be provisioned for VoLTE, but that just took one 611 call before.)
[08:54:07] <gordonfish> Seems a lot of long time customers are jumping ship, which shows a pattern, which seems to be AT&T really wanting to get what has to be a lot of people who have been off-contract for a while and especially older folks; coercing them into buying a new "approved" 5G device, as what's what they push when you walk into a store and try to get your phone, which was working before, sorted. In fact it's now policy to not be able to do anything for 
[08:54:07] <gordonfish> unapproved phones from their corporate stores.
[08:54:15] <gordonfish> Just crazy.

[21:16:59] <crazybigdan> How do I modify a third-party module (i.e. bring in the whole module but just modify the behavior of a single function)?
[21:17:45] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[21:18:55] <lopid> there are a number of ways, but the simplest might be to simply wrap it in your own function
[21:19:23] <lopid> depends on what it does, and what you want
[21:20:04] *** Quits: keir (~keir@user/keir) (Quit: I've gone)
[21:20:04] <crazybigdan> It is part of the Getopt::Args module, I want to change how _usage works, but I don't call that function directly, so I don't think wrapping it would help
[21:20:22] *** Joins: keir (~keir@user/keir)
[21:21:53] <lopid> can't edit its source?
[21:22:52] <crazybigdan> You mean, copy down the whole module, make changes and ship the modified copy with my own modules? I certainly could do that.
[21:25:03] <tm604> options include Class::Method::Modifiers::around if you just want to change the parameters passed to it, or copying the code for the function and just overwriting it via *Getops::Args::_usage = sub { ... }
[21:25:35] <tm604> (again, depends on what changes you want to make)
[21:25:44] <lopid> problem with that is if upstream changes
[21:26:05] <lopid> especially so since it looks like a private method
[21:26:52] <crazybigdan> The changes would be to adjust the formatting (not sure how popular Getopt::Args is). It also looks like that modules hasn't been updated since 2016
[21:26:59] <crazybigdan> s/modules/module/
