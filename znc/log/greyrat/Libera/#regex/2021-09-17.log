[04:38:19] <re101-rabbit-57> does this pullout Word seperated by either whitespace or non-alphanumeric characters? https://regex101.com/r/gPvIzv/6
[04:41:12] <re101-rabbit-57> im currently learning regex for a data analytics project and just cant seem to understand regex. also im on python
[04:44:50] <purplex> Not by whitespace, but by non-alphanumeric characters
[04:45:25] <purplex> but it includes whitespace, sure
[04:47:04] <purplex> The way you describe it "seperated by either whitespace or non-alphanumeric characters" is not what it does, anyway
[04:47:32] <purplex> E.g. There's no "Or" there
[04:48:20] <purplex> The best way to understand would be if you explain what do you are trying to do..
[04:51:04] *** ephemer0l is now known as GeneralDiscourse
[04:54:51] <re101-rabbit-57> thank you for replying, im trying to identify a specific Word in a dataframe. im only interested when the word is separated from other alphanumeric letters by either non-alphanumeric characters or whitespaces
[04:57:29] <re101-rabbit-57> like "Wordy" would not be included but "#Word " would
[04:57:50] <re101-rabbit-57> hope it makes sense
[05:00:18] <purplex> Are you considering \n to be your whitespaces?
[05:00:59] <re101-rabbit-57> yes
[05:03:02] <purplex> Well, then almost every Word ends with it
[05:04:27] <purplex> so "Word\n" would be a match

[22:36:32] <getivan> Is there a way to list the types of servers hosted by Libera? I'd like to find a C++ channel...
[22:50:13] *** Joins: OutreEE (~OutreEE@modemcable105.60-176-173.mc.videotron.ca)
[22:51:54] <getivan> nvm, I figured it out: https://libera.chat/guides/findingchannels
[22:52:41] <purplex> There should be an option in your client "Search Channels" as well.
[22:54:43] <getivan> Yeah, I see that, now... that's a bit easier... thanks! 
[22:55:51] <purplex> Have you programmed in C++?
[22:57:21] <getivan> No, I hired someone, and they're having trouble, so I'm seeing if someone can help...
[22:59:30] <purplex> Is it a problem beyond what a regex can solve?

[23:09:49] <getivan> Yeah, I need an external executable to remove spaces from line items... I used to have a batch program for it, but now I'm trying to get a C++ program for it...
[23:10:57] *** Joins: Nathan22 (~Nathan@199.249.111.186)
[23:11:35] <purplex> Regex can definitely do it. You can use a software to perform on multiple files as well
[23:12:19] <Nathan22> Hi, is it possible to predefine named capture groups for use in a pattern? Specifically using the Java11 regex package. I.e. like this: https://regex101.com/r/iBlcZD/1
[23:12:55] <Nathan22> Seems kind of silly that I have to define in the first usage and then refer to it from that point
[23:15:30] <purplex> getivan: Anyway, its a just a simple, you don't even need a regex if its only space from a [spacebar], just find space and replace with nothing.
[23:15:43] <purplex> simple task*
[23:16:36] <purplex> I wouldn't even use a C++ executable or pay for anything

[23:26:09] <getivan> It has to be run as an executable, though...
[23:37:08] <purplex> Even if there are easier options to achieve the same goal?
[23:38:40] <getivan> The goal isn't achieved if it can't be run as an executable... it's a part of a sequenced scripting process...
[23:40:29] <purplex> Okay, I see. So, a module part of something.
[23:41:39] <purplex> Does it have to be "C++" though?
[23:50:06] *** Quits: r3m (~launch@user/r3m) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3-dev)
[23:56:23] <getivan> Yeah, no it doesn't have to be C++... I had something that was a batch script before, but I recently had issues transferring it to new servers. So, I went shopping for someone to do it for me in Python, and they suggested C++, but they had issues with it at the very end, and so I had to cancel. C++ is supposed to be the fastest, and at large files, the batch script was taking forever... so that's where I'm at now... LoL
[23:56:44] <getivan> I have to brb in 5mins, though, because my computer needs to reboot... brb!

[23:59:53] <purplex> Interesting, never heard removing all spaces from a large files; perhaps the goal is to make them "unreadable".
