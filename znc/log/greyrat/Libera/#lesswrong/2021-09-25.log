[01:02:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: That has two problems. The immediate practical problem is that if they raise wages their margins might disappear and then they go bust. (Food service profit margins do not tend to be high.) The larger problem is that if there's an undersupply of suitable workers, then, while raising the wage will indeed draw more applicants, it may not draw many more unsuitable applicants than suitable ones; this will raise the time
[01:02:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  (and lost revenue) overhead of the interview process, and will increase "false positives" for useful hires (also resulting in lost revenue).

[06:09:57] <shawwwn> never seen anyone hate phones more
[06:14:56] <gwern> no, that was cognitive interference from thinking about 'definitions'. I was going for something like 'the akbar meme has died because the definition of 'it's a trap' has changed'

[06:17:53] <shawwwn> probably more of a regressive autosubstantiation encoder than a GPT, but sure
[06:18:07] <shawwwn> I really don't think any of our techniques resemble life 
[06:18:10] <gwern> (you see this elsewhere in 'automatic writing' or 'speaking in tongues' or oujia boards or subvocalizations or trying to read in dreams, but those are all fairly exotic compared to just typing along and suddenly going 'who the hell wrote *that*')
[06:18:21] <shawwwn> it just happened to seem similar
[06:18:30] <shawwwn> the similarities break down when you look too closely, like quantum mechanics

[06:28:17] <shawwwn> at one point she said that they were going to sell present-day coins at closure-time rates, and then pay back only that portion. But then I pointed out that would mean japan would be keeping the majority of the recovered BTC for themselves
[06:28:31] <shawwwn> and that threw both of us into existential crisis
[06:29:11] <shawwwn> so I voted "yes" on the plan and put https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lNZ_Rnr7Jc&list=PLag38xQjTn1XSMB9bwDIq_1387z1Z_PIG&index=14 and consoled myself that even if they do pay out, it'll only be a fraction of the 7.7 BTC that I have locked up

[06:31:28] <gwern> yes, I think that's why people were so upset that they had to change it: because it'd be utterly bizarre if mtgox walked away worth billions of dollars as a reward for fucking up that badly
[06:32:04] <gwern> it would make a lot more sense to just liquidate and distribute pro rata to depositors
[06:32:53] <gwern> in which case, ironically, ex post if not ex ante, most mtgox depositors would have been *much* better off because mtgox went down. it essentially functions as an enforced savings account - almost all of the holders would've sold out years and years ago, missing out on most of the returns
[06:33:34] <gwern> a little piggybank you deposited into in 2014 when bitcoin was like $500 and then weren't allowed to smash until 2021 when bitcoin was like $60,000
[06:40:55] <shawwwn> I had the same thought. $11k in, $45k out isn’t bad at all.
[06:41:10] <shawwwn> But then I realized it’ll probably be closer to $2k, if anything
[06:47:25] <gwern> hm? why? they recovered a decent fraction of the bitcoins, and bitcoin went up many multiples, so they should be able to pay out a lot per 2014-bitcoin
[06:48:55] <PlanckWalk> If a large fraction of these coins were suddenly offered on the market, would the price remain where it is now?
[06:50:00] <gwern> bitcoin is an extremely large and thick market at this point, and mtgox has been grinding on for half a decade. I wouldn't worry about it
[06:50:23] <quanticle> Enforced hodling
[06:52:30] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, I just quickly checked that volume is something like a million BTC/day

[07:12:35] <shawwwn> gwern: it might go how you say. Regardless, somewhere between $2k and $44k is a fine result for a $11k initial investment a decade-ish ago. Doubt it'll be anywhere close to $44k, but $2k is still an unexpected new laptop.
[07:13:06] <shawwwn> there are apparently N payout rounds, and each payout round progresses until no more payouts can happen. So it's a while loop in that sense
[07:14:00] <shawwwn> I anticipate that at the end of it, most people will end up with a lot less than they started with. It's true they recovered 200k BTC or so. But that caps the possible returns at 20% in the best case, and much lower in the worst case

[12:00:13] <shawwwn> Her parents executed on it brilliantly irc
[12:00:39] <shawwwn> They were like an agency marketing consulting team combo power couple
[12:00:46] <shawwwn> At this point I’m just throwing out words
[12:01:04] <shawwwn> But suffice to say, her patents ran the show, and Greta was their star
[12:01:12] <saturn2> i guess the real lesson here is, jeffrey epstein did nothing wrong

[12:11:20] <saturn2> it says i'm not valid
[12:11:35] <saturn2> that's pretty insulting tbh

[12:12:31] <shawwwn> I even set up my car as an organizational resource

[12:12:50] <saturn2> i'm not totally sure what this is but sure why not

[12:21:29] <shawwwn> Lol
[12:22:03] <ggreer> If you get in it on a weekday morning, it auto routes to work (also 600 miles away)
[12:22:17] <saturn2> you are taunting me!!

[12:24:56] <PapuaHardyNet> good luck for work for the win?
[12:26:35] <shawwwn> Nah glfw was an OpenGL framework popular back in the days when it was serious effort just to draw a white triangle
[12:27:06] <shawwwn> glxl was … uh … something related to that. I’m ashamed to say I forget.
[12:27:08] <nshepperd2> it's a starcraft abbreviation which means 'good luck, fat wanker'
[12:27:43] <nshepperd2> (not really. but, what if...?)
[12:28:02] <shawwwn> nshepperd2 can come too if you want. You can be in the Sciences division
[12:28:04] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god I used glfw last year as part of a graphics course
[12:28:10] <shawwwn> yes
[12:28:15] <nshepperd2> cool, alright
[12:28:22] <shawwwn> It’s pretty nice.
[12:28:33] <nshepperd2> science officers only sometimes die
[12:28:38] <shawwwn> At least compared to regular OpenGL

[12:38:03] <shawwwn> Should work now
[12:38:11] <feepbot> 1Password — Password Manager for Teams, Businesses, and Families
[12:38:23] <nshepperd2> huh, gmail now has 'report spam' and 'report phishing'
[12:38:50] <shawwwn> So maybe with four people in, there will be a higher chance of people adding memes
[12:39:23] <kuudes> over here we have had the system that a person younger than 18 can apply to be recognized as a capable adult
[12:39:40] <nshepperd2> wget --spider ended up at 404 not found, lame
[12:39:54] <kuudes> and then the ministry of justice could, after hearing the person and experts either grant or deny that application
[12:40:09] <saturn2> what's the purpose of this 1password thing?
[12:40:23] <shawwwn> To consume $5/mo of course
[12:40:24] <kuudes> that still does not get them over some age limits, such as 21 for harder alcohol or 18 to vote
[12:40:27] <shawwwn> Per user
[12:40:39] <PapuaHardyNet> respect for admitting the truth
[12:40:55] <shawwwn> But hell, with a $11k stipend, it’s hard to use too much
[12:40:56] <kuudes> but it allows them to make a will and get married, as those are things that can't be consented through a representative
[12:41:04] <shawwwn> Other than literally lighting it on fire
[12:41:12] <kuudes> iirc it has or will be faded out though given the fear of more child marriages in near future
[12:41:14] <shawwwn> We have $5k of aws credits too
[12:41:26] <shawwwn> Feel free to use those for whatever you want
[12:41:45] * shawwwn can’t think of anything
[12:42:10] <nshepperd2> great, i'll set up a huge minecraft server and invite everyone
[12:42:37] <shawwwn> I literally jumped out of bed with glee at the mere idea of that
[12:42:43] <shawwwn> So please do
[12:43:18] <nshepperd2> i was kidding. unless..? but no i dont' really have time for that
[12:43:33] <nshepperd2> wait, is it $5k of aws credits per month?
[12:43:34] <shawwwn> Ah well
[12:43:41] <shawwwn> Yeah
[12:43:46] <nshepperd2> wow
[12:43:50] <shawwwn> Indefinitely. They accumulate too
[12:44:01] <shawwwn> So after ten years or so, we should have a lot
[12:44:10] <shawwwn> I’m just kidding. It’s $5k total
[12:44:17] <shawwwn> That would be nice though
[12:44:28] <saturn2> do you mind if i use it to seed torrents
[12:44:43] <shawwwn> Please do
[12:45:02] <saturn2> sweet
[12:45:12] <shawwwn> I shall proceed to drop the creds into the 1Password thing
[12:45:39] <shawwwn> Oh, uhhh, bandwidth tends to be expensive on aws…
[12:46:10] <shawwwn> Are you sure you wouldn’t rather set up a hetzner seedbox using our $500 ops card?
[12:46:25] <shawwwn> I made virtual cards for everyone too
[12:46:32] <saturn2> wow :O
[12:46:49] <shawwwn> Just make sure it’s something you can talk about when asked.
[12:47:08] <shawwwn> Even “because it seemed interesting”
[12:47:19] <shawwwn> A fine reason to do things imo
[12:47:34] <saturn2> all right
[12:47:36] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: probably best to wait for the hetzner 50TB box
[12:47:44] <shawwwn> Oh, speaking of that
[12:47:46] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what would be cool though
[12:47:54] <PapuaHardyNet> having a scihub mirror
[12:48:01] <shawwwn> No need to wait, you can right bow
[12:48:04] <shawwwn> Now
[12:48:22] <PapuaHardyNet> naw, I don't have the bandwidth to do cool things yet :/
[12:48:26] <shawwwn> I’ve been dragging my feet like hemmm hawww but what if we used raid0 daww
[12:48:34] <shawwwn> Yeah that too
[12:48:50] <shawwwn> Maybe satuen2 will deck it out
[12:49:03] <shawwwn> satahn2
[12:49:12] <PapuaHardyNet> satan2, you mean?
[12:49:19] <shawwwn> it’s not a tumah
[12:57:56] <shawwwn> ok, I added all three of you as bookkeepers to the mercury bank account. Which means you have read-only access to see everything. (don't reveal the name of the $10k investor; they asked to be kept secret.)
[12:58:19] <shawwwn> looks like I can't actually create cards for you until you accept the invitation at your @tensorfork.com address
[12:58:56] <shawwwn> there's $500 in the Ops checking account; the remaining $10,500 is in the main TL account
[13:03:22] <shawwwn> just try to be conservative with the resources. our current burn rate is almost literally infinite (5 years) https://i.imgur.com/5Hi7Pxj.png
[13:03:51] <shawwwn> that's including the 64TB hetzner server
[13:03:54] <shawwwn> with infinite bandwidth
[13:04:06] <shawwwn> so my intention is to put imagenet on it and make it available to the world for free
[13:04:24] <shawwwn> for seeding torrents, I was looking into seedboxes
[13:04:39] <shawwwn> you can get some pretty sweet deals on the cheap, but
[13:05:34] <shawwwn> I imagine that doing a little seeding on the hetzner server won't impact things either
[13:05:46] <shawwwn> the only reason I was slightly nervous about aws is because bandwidth is charged at some insane rate like $0.12/GB
[13:06:08] <shawwwn> it's literally the only thing other than GCS bucket fees that can drain credits more or less instantly
[13:06:16] <shawwwn> and is the primary way they make their money, I imagine
[13:06:44] <shawwwn> but hetzner is kickass because you get 1gbit links with unlimited bandwidth
[13:07:01] <shawwwn> so theoretically you can fire up like 5 $5/mo boxes and get 5gbit
[13:07:24] <shawwwn> which you can do whenever you accept the mercury invite, since I'll issue you a fancy looking virtual card
[13:07:54] <shawwwn> https://i.imgur.com/x1Sgzrh.png
[13:10:29] <shawwwn> in fact, I can even ship you a physical card https://i.imgur.com/qY9RGsb.png it looks so pretty. Not that you'd be able to use it on anything, since every expense does need to be business related
[13:10:51] <shawwwn> and it's hard to imagine how a store purchase could be
[13:11:20] <shawwwn> I did *almost* spend $100 on a chair, but I was able to restrain myself and spend $30 (of my own money, not the business's) on chair padding instead
[13:11:27] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[13:12:19] <shawwwn> every transaction will be reconciled in quickbooks, which basically just means I type a note for what it was for, so that when tax time comes around the IRS isn't like "lol yeah we're revoking your 501(c)(3) status"
[13:13:10] <shawwwn> but feel free to spend a few hundred on research projects. after all, the money is there to be used
[13:13:28] <shawwwn> I just haven't been able to think of interesting ways to use it
[13:13:41] <shawwwn> turns out, creativity and time seem to be the constraints, rather than money. that was a surprising thing.

[13:17:58] <shawwwn> oh, how weird. okay so apparently bookkeepers don't actually get card access https://i.imgur.com/Zy1Z6PG.png even though you can see all of the funds
[13:18:04] <shawwwn> guess I'll report that as a bug
[13:18:06] <shawwwn> in the meantime...
[13:18:17] * shawwwn tries additionally inviting everyone as card-only users
[13:19:29] <shawwwn> um. apparently it's not a bug https://i.imgur.com/ibUrVTJ.png

[13:26:55] <shawwwn> but feel free to do random shit like set up a hetzner seedbox
[13:29:06] <shawwwn> at this point I've been awake so long that I'm starting to be concerned that sleep is no longer going to happen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_insomnia
[13:29:18] <feepbot> Fatal insomnia is an extremely rare genetic disorder that results in trouble sleeping as its hallmark symptom. The problems with sleeping typically start out gradually and worsen over time.
[13:29:29] <kuudes> didn't you have narcolepsy?
[13:29:30] <shawwwn> also lol at naming it fatal insomnia. Imagine a doctor saying with a straight face "You have fatal insomnia"
[13:29:33] <shawwwn> yes
[13:29:40] <saturn2> don't die :(

[13:42:46] <PapuaHardyNet> do you really have fatal insomnia? I thought it was just narcolepsy
[13:43:31] <kuudes> I guess the rational thing to do is for me to apply for tensorfork as well, even though I feel I have some sort of fear that I would then have to face that I don't actually do anything even when given resources

[14:06:02] <Betawolf> does google help people find their way to the meeting in your car?
[14:06:13] <shawwwn> good question
[14:06:18] <shawwwn> kuudes should try to book a meeting
[14:06:58] <shawwwn> I'm pretty sure that this was meant to manage buildings, but "resources" was sufficiently ambiguous that I was like "Uhh, I guess I have a car"
[14:07:01] <kuudes> ok, now I managed to create the accounts
[14:07:08] <shawwwn> so it didn't occur to me until afterwards that it was supposed to be a building
[14:07:31] <shawwwn> it's pretty accurate though. my car is in the lower level, with a capacity of 4 
[14:07:38] <shawwwn> it is in fact a Vehicle

[14:18:38] <kuudes> what is aim of tensorfork?
[14:18:49] <shawwwn> https://wiki.tensorfork.com/
[14:18:59] <shawwwn> our mission is to make AI research accessible to every programmer

[14:19:30] <shawwwn> right now, anyone can theoretically get started with AI. But anyone who's tried to actually do that knows how fucking impossible it feels
[14:19:55] <shawwwn> with things like "wtf? I can't get access to imagenet? but everyone uses it... wait, everyone *torrents* imagenet? that's standard practice?"
[14:20:05] <shawwwn> tearing down barriers like that is the goal
[14:20:17] <shawwwn> so that's what I've been planning to do.
[14:20:25] <kuudes> nice
[14:20:31] <shawwwn> it's proceeding apace. I didn't expect organization setup to take a month, but meh
[14:20:54] <shawwwn> that also factors in "spending a week or so recovering from sprinting every day trying to set up the organization" :)
[14:22:40] <synthmeat> shawwwn: what's the setup, pass-through, s, c?
[14:22:56] <shawwwn> hm what do you mean
[14:23:00] <synthmeat> the company
[14:23:08] *** Joins: [_] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[14:23:17] <shawwwn> oh! non profit
[14:23:22] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, pass-through is a kind of company formation? that's new to me
[14:23:38] <shawwwn> yeah that's the official legal term actually, a passthru corp because the money passes through to the owner
[14:23:54] <synthmeat> PapuaHardyNet: type of llc, you can choose to get taxed as pass-through individuals. has its perks.
[14:23:55] <PapuaHardyNet> "Pass-through businesses are the dominant business structure in America. Pass throughs file more tax returns and report more business income than C corporations. Pass-through businesses are not subject to the corporate income tax, but instead report their income on the individual income tax returns of owners."
[14:23:57] <shawwwn> looks like synthmeat knows a thing or two. I need that knowledge because I'm currently struggling to set up an S corp to do a contract gig
[14:24:14] <shawwwn> I wanted to pay out 40% of income as dividends
[14:24:20] <shawwwn> because apparently it has tax benefits
[14:24:35] <synthmeat> been involved in unmessing a couple, and started a few of my own. no experience with non-profits though.
[14:24:36] <shawwwn> but people are pointing out it's still taxed at long term capital gains rate
[14:24:43] <shawwwn> so now I'm unsure whether to bother
[14:25:14] <shawwwn> neither do I :) I applied for the EIN before I even realized I needed to incorporate
[14:25:21] <synthmeat> s corp is a no immediately if you're gonna have foreign shareholders
[14:25:32] <shawwwn> no, it's just me

[14:26:05] <shawwwn> oh yes, speaking of recruiting, tensorfork is set up with Gusto
[14:26:12] <shawwwn> meaning I can technically put all of you on payroll as contractors
[14:26:38] <shawwwn> will i? hell no, the taxes are already going to be complicated. but perhaps for $50 as a meme
[14:26:44] <kuudes> I don't want to be on payroll so far because then I would have to tell my employer. I have decided I have joined some sort of association
[14:27:05] <synthmeat> shareholders can't be contractors
[14:27:13] <shawwwn> good good, that makes things simpler. but out of curiosity why would you need to inform your employer?
[14:28:10] <shawwwn> I'll be doing two contract gigs, and neither know or care about the other. as long as the science gets done and I make a neat {gun,bank,GPT} no one bats an eye
[14:28:14] <shawwwn> speaking of guns
[14:28:15] <shawwwn> .rr
[14:28:16] <feepbot> shawwwn: Click. 
[14:29:34] <shawwwn> anyway, that said, the SX server was what I had my eye on (thank you ivan for pointing it out!) https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/matrix-sx
[14:29:38] <shawwwn> 4x 16TB
[14:30:15] <shawwwn> saturn2 should totally set one up and deck it out. I was thinking xfs + raid0, and then I realized that was probably insane
[14:30:24] <shawwwn> because it means that any disk failure will result in total system failure
[14:30:32] <shawwwn> even if it is theoretically the fastest possible configuration
[14:30:46] <shawwwn> but then I remembered we could technically upgrade to 10Gbit
[14:30:58] <shawwwn> and *then* I realized that 10Gbit is pointless because the spinning disks can't read data that fast
[14:31:31] <shawwwn> so I went back to "I'll probably just stick with a safe configuration" for some value of "safe" that I have no idea about
[14:31:46] <shawwwn> ideally it would be pretty much the polar opposite of gwern's hetzner dystopia
[14:32:15] <shawwwn> since any basic operation is painful enough that you want to gouge out your kneecap as the lesser of two pains
[14:32:50] <shawwwn> apparently one nice advantage of XFS is that it can read lots of directories really quickly; file listing is fast. That's no small benefit in ML, weirdly enough
[14:33:02] <shawwwn> since lots of the datasets are like 50500123 small files
[14:33:36] <synthmeat> "easy backups" was perk #1 for xfs for me
[14:34:16] <shawwwn> oh? I didn't realize that either
[14:34:27] <shawwwn> no idea why people even use zfs then
[14:34:31] <shawwwn> it seemed nothing but pain
[14:34:44] <shawwwn> and xfs seemed like hardly known
[14:35:04] <PapuaHardyNet> what is gwern's hetzner dystopia
[14:37:28] <shawwwn> wtf, apparently I hadn't shared the 1password vaults with you yet PapuaHardyNet? Sorry I'm an idiot
[14:37:33] <shawwwn> okay, everyone should have all the vaults now
[14:43:28] <shawwwn> gwern's hetzner dystopia was that it was slightly slow to do basic operations but nothing too terrible
[14:43:45] <shawwwn> moving around (cd, etc) and looking at things (vi, etc) was annoyingly slow
[14:44:08] <shawwwn> but gwern's track record is far better than mine
[14:44:18] <shawwwn> gwern.net runs off the box now, after all

[20:53:04] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Two economists who study US housing are Ed Glaeser of Harvard University and Joseph Gyourko of the Wharton School. Some years ago, they did a study that used a clever method of separating the effects of scarce land from the effects of restrictions on building. They looked at houses that were comparable in size, amenities, and location but that differed in one main respect:
[20:53:04] <feepbot> one had much more land than the other. If scarcity of land were the crucial factor, then a house with much more land should sell for a much higher price. But that’s not what they found. Instead, a house with a quarter acre of additional land sold for only about $10,000 to $20,000 more. But, they found, a quarter‐​acre empty lot on which building was permitted often sold for
[20:53:04] <feepbot> over ten times that amount. That means that the key driver in high house prices is not scarcity of land but scarcity of building permits. Economists have known this for a long time. One who pointed it out early in his career was Lawrence Katz of Harvard University. In 1981, because Katz graduated as the top economics undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, he was
[20:53:09] <feepbot> given the honor of making a commencement speech. He devoted the whole speech to pointing out to his audience that a key cause of high housing prices in the San Francisco Bay Area was government restrictions on supply. He noted that just ten years earlier, the median price of a California house was not much above the national median. But government restrictions on building had grown

[23:38:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the United States, it has not been banned.

[23:53:22] <feep> oh wait it's not a mistake at all, I'm just stupid XD
[23:53:40] <Dyo> Obormot\Arcturus: acids in bread are formed by bacteria. the amount added for gluten strengthening is very low (<100mg/kg) so it does not inhibit said bacteria (even if it did lower pH - these are naturally acid resistant bacteria). if adding vitamin C affects taste of your bread, chances are you are using way too much. there is also no point in adding when using sourdough or long duration yeast fermentation since the other acid
[23:53:40] <Dyo> s have the same effect on gluten.
