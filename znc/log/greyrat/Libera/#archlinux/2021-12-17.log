[04:12:26] <One39Dev> is it a good idea to run syslog-ng beside the journald?
[04:13:07] <One39Dev> As for example default setting which is not to forward to syslog if changed to forward to syslog and restarted journald syslog still do not exist by default on arch. 
[04:13:23] <thrice> do you need it?
[04:13:26] <thurstylark> what does that provide you that the journal doesn't do?
[04:13:27] <One39Dev> Its not created as syslog-ng is never enabled or started.
[04:13:31] <One39Dev> Nothing
[04:13:42] <One39Dev> Its just parsiong specific things with my old script.
[04:13:47] <One39Dev> I can adapt it. 
[04:15:21] <One39Dev> Also is it good to maybe disable the audit loging in the journald? Audit generates a lot of messages especially with auditd setup to cover changes and execution of a large amount of files or directories.

[16:09:06] <ponies> oh i see 
[16:09:43] <Sneakyfish> Does anyone uses command line client for habit tracking ?
[16:09:48] <Zambzuga> probably faster to go and buy a wifi adapter that is supported in the kernel tbh :P

[16:15:17] <Scimmia> Zambzuga: why not just build the package, THEN transfer it to USB
[16:15:48] <Zambzuga> Yeah got the tar.zst file fro both the headers and the driver now so should be fine

[18:43:56] <Tom^> luigibu: i guess if you have setup HW specific xorg.conf's or other things those will need some changes.
[18:44:03] <Tom^> but by default its pretty generic :p
[18:44:16] <RealFloridaMan> there is any way to solve in  haveged Condition: start condition failed | ConditionKernelVersion=<5.6 was not met

[18:44:35] <Tom^> RealFloridaMan: haveged isnt needed above 5.6 or so i heard.
[18:44:55] <luigibu> yes.. i put some specific stuff.. but still i think.. the work will be less painful making a migration.
[18:45:03] <jkc> That's exactly why haveged won't start, the error says as much.
[18:45:15] <mikebutash> they always blame xorg, say wayland is the way forward, but I suspect it'll be same shit, different graphics backend.

[19:04:06] <jkc> RealFloridaMan: Okay, but is that service listed in critical-path? If not, then nothing you do with that service will change your boot time, because other things are happening at the same time that take longer.
[19:04:39] <RealFloridaMan> is not listed, just on blame
[19:04:41] <Zambzuga> mikebutash, this is during install of arch. I can see the ssid of the router on my phone.
[19:05:04] <jkc> RealFloridaMan: Then nothing you do with that service is going to shorten your boot time, because - again - other things are happening at the same time that take longer.
[19:05:39] <RealFloridaMan> with haveged I solved that
[19:05:53] <jkc> There is no "solving." Read what I've said - twice - again.
[19:06:09] <jkc> If the service isn't in the critical path, then it is not affecting your boot times.
[19:06:20] <thurstylark> ahhhhh setting PIPEWIRE_LATENCY doesn't affect pulse clients. no fuckin wonder
[19:06:39] <RealFloridaMan> the thing is, used to boot in 3 seconds now takes +5 with that service

[19:59:45] <kuhilas> hmm ok that question mark doesn't mean it's a problem because it shows that even when I can still reboot without the lag
[19:59:45] <bud> then you can just use $X -> bindsym Mod4+p $X urxvt
[20:00:32] <bud> kuhilas: this also applies to exec that isn't started by a keybinding, and i think there are some in the default i3 config.
[20:00:41] <ponies> kuhilas: also post i3 logs 
[20:00:56] <bud> if you add this --no-startup-id flag to the exec, you will not have annoying mousecursor and lag.

[22:32:54] <Hydragyrum> I've got a machine with a perc6 that doesn't have any options besides raid modes -- to have all the disks passed through, you need to set them up as separate raid0 sets

[22:33:18] <Hydragyrum> so generally yes a raid controller can decide a single disk is in raid mode but it'd be raid0 and pointless

[23:41:37] <gpiccoli> Hey folks, I have a question about PKGBUILD - I'm installing a file into a system directory (a systemd service) - I'm using "install -D -m<perm> file /lib/systemd/system/file" . Problem: after package generation, when I tried pacman -U <mypkg>, I got an error of conflicting files, "/lib exists in filesystem (owned by filesystem)"
[23:42:04] <gpiccoli> Is there a way to install tgis file there without requiring a "force" flag on pacman -U ? Tnx in advance !
[23:43:15] <mpan> “/usr/lib” ?

[23:46:09] <gpiccoli> mpan, but this is a systemd service, so I'll need it on the systemd service directory! I've checked other pkgs that have files there, like xfsprogs and smartmontools - the trick is that they run a "make install" on package() function, which does the dirty job for them heheh

[23:46:26] <gpiccoli> jkc, these files come in the "bundle" with the PKGBUILD
[23:46:32] <jkc> Konsgn: Walk me through exactly what you did to install Arch.
[23:46:35] <gpiccoli> my package is self-contained, just some scripts
[23:46:36] <mpan> gpiccoli: “/usr/lib/systemd/system/file” 
[23:46:46] <jkc> gpiccoli: I was responding to something way the hell in my scrollback, sorry for the confusion.
[23:46:49] <Namarrgon> gpiccoli: /lib is a symlink, you don'T want to overwrite it with a directory
[23:47:18] <gpiccoli> no problem jkc =)
[23:47:58] <gpiccoli> Namarrgon, indeed! What I want is a way of my package just copy my systemd service over there..I don't want it to overwrite
[23:48:07] <mpan> gpiccoli: see what I wrote
[23:48:23] <Namarrgon> gpiccoli: then don't install to /lib
[23:48:28] <gpiccoli> I saw it mpan , thanks. But I checked this folder, no other service is there
[23:48:42] <mpan> Well… this is where you try to install it anyway.

[23:49:00] <mpan> Those are exactly the same directories. “/lib” is a symlink to “/usr/lib”.
[23:49:34] <gpiccoli> ugh, not in my system
