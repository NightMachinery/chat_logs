[00:15:22] <FunkyBob> in what way do they not 'fit'?
[00:17:49] <silverdust> FunkyBob: I want them to be 50% 50% for 2 images in the figcaption
[00:18:31] <FunkyBob> they look 50% to me
[00:18:51] <silverdust> 25% each for 4 images, etc and to never overflow the <figure>

[03:34:05] <wannakiss> jQuery Mobile is pretty bad :/
[03:34:52] <wannakiss> And it's been tainting jQuery's name ever since it flopped
[03:35:27] <FunkyBob> just how much JS are you even using?
[03:37:09] <wannakiss> I actually wrote an entire app in jQuery Mobile because it seemed like a quick and easy way to create a mobile app
[03:39:01] <wannakiss> I'm actually glad I did

[04:00:58] <FunkyBob> and (b) some of the modern ones will dynamiclly build based on what you use
[04:01:16] <WishBoy> I can't depend totally on JS CDN
[04:01:32] <WishBoy>  <FunkyBob> and (b) some of the modern ones will dynamiclly build based on what you use (it's good)
[04:01:36] <wannakiss> WishBoy: Nice argument, never thought of that before
[04:02:27] <wannakiss> I just think they all look like crap basically
[04:02:51] <FunkyBob> who said anything about a CDN/
[04:03:12] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: the better ones are meant as starting points, not whole design
[04:03:59] <wannakiss> What was once <div class="funkybob wishboy">Hello World!</div> is now <div class="funkybob wishboy tme 3 39uf a9sud sd9u"><div class="left asdasd dbgf right bold font"><div><div></div></div>
[04:04:47] <wannakiss> FunkyBob: True that
[04:04:58] <WishBoy> wannakiss let's imagine a project with some frameworks, JQuery, Bootstrap, among others... let's imagine that we have a total of 100Kbytes unnecessary in lines, it seems little... it seems, times 500k users per day = additional 50Gigabytes
[04:05:24] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: not all CSS frameworks work t hat way
[04:05:49] <FunkyBob> some use less or sass so you actually compose your own classes, etc
[04:06:03] <FunkyBob> again, you seem to discount the effectiveness of caching
[04:07:55] <WishBoy> yes, Cloudflare, cdnjs.com, jsDelivr, among others more
[04:08:01] <wannakiss> I see I see, doesn't sound too bad. Only tried Bootstrap and Bulma.
[04:08:10] <FunkyBob> no
[04:08:19] <FunkyBob> why do you assuming "use caching" means "use a CDN"?
[04:08:32] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: bulma is SCSS based, last I checked
[04:08:46] <FunkyBob> it does offer a 'kitchen sink' CSS build, but you don't have to use that
[04:09:10] <wannakiss> Well
[04:09:10] <FunkyBob> WishBoy: HTTP has support for caching built into it.
[04:09:14] <wannakiss> It was positive
[04:09:19] <FunkyBob> enable eTags on your server... and a lot of it 'just works'
[04:09:36] <WishBoy> FunkyBob because the local memory cache (Varnish or other) on my servers still uses my bandwidth, I need the files to be on other servers to save my bandwidth, I have monthly bandwidth limit
[04:09:50] <FunkyBob> one of the benefots of a CSS framework is they've already dealt with a lot of browser bugs and XB compat issues.
[04:09:59] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[04:10:05] <FunkyBob> WishBoy: not talking about server-side caching
[04:10:11] <FunkyBob> do you not realise your web browser has caching?
[04:10:16] <wannakiss> In the sense that it made me go "Fuck this, I'm just gonna write my own CSS from scratch instead :-)"
[04:10:29] <WishBoy> FunkyBob now about browser cache, first access needs download, then it will be determined by lifetime
[04:10:32] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: indeed... the css for my blog is 100% hand rolled
[04:10:44] <wannakiss> I've never used a CDN before, how's it like?
[04:10:44] <FunkyBob> WishBoy: lifetime, or etag
[04:11:05] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: CDNs can benefit from providing caching, as well as geographically local points of presence
[04:11:21] <FunkyBob> so, for instance, requesting content from the CDN might, for me, hit their australian servers
[04:11:24] <FunkyBob> reducing the latency
[04:11:28] <WishBoy> wannakiss instead of putting the link calling the framework on your domain, you put the CDN URL.
[04:11:53] <WishBoy> wannakiss just don't forget to use the same version you're using to develop
[04:12:34] <WishBoy> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha512-UR25UO94eTnCVwjbXozyeVd6ZqpaAE9naiEUBK/A+QDbfSTQFhPGj5lOR6d8tsgbBk84Ggb5A3EkjsOgPRPcKA==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
[04:12:44] <WishBoy> Bootstrap 5.1.3 on Cloudflare
[04:12:46] <WishBoy> CDN
[04:13:16] <wannakiss> I feel so stupid for not knowing this sooner
[04:13:31] <FunkyBob> for $DAYJOB we use AWSs CDN in front of a S3 bucket
[04:13:48] <FunkyBob> the static parts of the site [whcih is all, being a SPA] are super fast
[04:13:58] <FunkyBob> they also manage compressing the content when supported
[04:14:25] <wannakiss> Nice
[04:14:44] <WishBoy> wannakissthis has a good point, as Cloudflare uses the server closest to your ISP (region), as they are "Anycast" requests, so users who are not from the same country as the datacenter you have dedicated servers or another, it will make a loading of the framework in the country by Cloudflare (since Cloudflare has servers all over the world)
[04:14:46] <wannakiss> Can they take content from my soon-to-be users, like photo uploads etc.?

[04:15:35] <FunkyBob> typically they act as a cache in front of your site... a proxy
[04:15:36] <wannakiss> Thanks a lot for the tips guys
[04:15:55] <FunkyBob> but once you introduce caching, you are now faced with cache invalidation
[04:16:31] <wannakiss> Ah, that's the stuff you mentioned earlier?
[04:16:39] <FunkyBob> indeed
[04:16:41] * wannakiss notes it down
[04:17:37] <FunkyBob> basically, how do you decide when the CDN cache should ask your site for fresh copies
[04:18:06] <FunkyBob> this is where all those games of including hashes in filenames came from... because people didn't understand HTTP, or their tools didn't let them use it properly
[04:19:06] <wannakiss> I've seen those filenames, so that's why huh.
[04:19:22] <FunkyBob> yes... if the content changes, the filename changes,
[04:19:32] <FunkyBob> it does have the benefit of old and new versions can be online concurrently
[04:19:51] <FunkyBob> but if you're doing it solely for cache invalidation... you'd likely be better off relying on etags
[04:20:55] <WishBoy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag
[04:21:02] <WishBoy> Avoiding mid-air collisions
[04:21:02] <WishBoy> With the help of the ETag and the If-Match headers, you can detect mid-air edit collisions.
[04:21:08] <wannakiss> By the way guys, are CSS sprites still a thing?
[04:21:44] <wannakiss> Heard someone say HTTP2 would make sprites obsolete or something?
[04:21:50] <FunkyBob> wannakiss: as in packed images?
[04:21:54] <wannakiss> Yep

[04:24:03] <wannakiss> Damn, we said the same word at the same time
[04:24:11] <FunkyBob> that said, they can often produce better compression, and lower overall payload due to reduced overheads
[04:24:16] <FunkyBob> each image has a header, etc...

[05:50:38] <wannakiss> but frontend and programming uses primarily the left side of the brain, and design uses the right, and it's very rare (if not impossible) to see a person with full mastery of both
[05:54:37] <wannakiss> like i noticed the other day that music is also a right brain thing. most talented musicians are incredibly good designers as well. but i've yet to see such a person venture into and conquer left sided professions like doctors, engineers or lawyers
[05:58:14] <wannakiss> my personal theory is that it has something to do with the way the brain works -- that during adolescence it is forced to choose one of the two sides of the hemisphere before it can settle and grow up into an adult sized brain
