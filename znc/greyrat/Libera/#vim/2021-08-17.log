[00:57:57] <nickspoon> ^ I like this shortcut form
[00:58:05] <ash_worksi> or it's not like `d` where they're in a buffer?
[00:58:49] <nova> ash_worksi, vim deletes them and does not even store them in any register - not even @-
[00:59:55] <ash_worksi> i see
[01:00:01] <nova> vim doesn't track deletion in insert mode, but if you use c0 for instance, first this creates a text object, then deletes that part and puts you in insert mode, and vim can track this. (vim stores small deletions like that in @- and @")
[01:00:48] <ash_worksi> is there a yank in insert mode? how do I search that? :h i_<YANK> perhaps/
[01:01:02] <nickspoon> there's not
[01:01:09] <nova> negative, batwoman
[01:01:13] <ash_worksi> I see
[01:01:39] <ash_worksi> guess I'll continue to flip back to normal mode for that
[01:02:35] <nickspoon> I found vim easier once I got into the mindset of doing EVERYTHING in normal mode. And only entering insert mode to make explicit insertions, and get out as quickly as possible
[01:02:54] <nova> ^\ ^o c 0   :)   then ^r - to paste
[01:03:18] <ash_worksi> can you move switch windows in insert mode?

[01:03:33] <nickspoon> No
[01:03:50] <nickspoon> You can make mappings to do it, of course

[01:39:50] <hseg> ... on second thought, might be worth going to a different language for this

[12:14:28] <Julian> japh: (also unrelatedly, but just to be sure, probably be sure it's really encoded as latin 1 -- everything is decodable as latin-1, but it still could be using some other encoding)
[12:14:34] <japh> romainl, yes
[12:15:04] <romainl> then it's mostly ASCII anyway so there shouldn't be so many changes
[12:15:22] <japh> julian, how can I tell?
[12:15:44] <japh> romainl, hah, 1.4 million lines of code and probably 300k lines of comments with ÅÄÖ in them
[12:16:10] <Julian> japh: By asking someone, there's not really any other reliable way

[16:12:43] <habamax> why new vim should have contents of the registers of the old vim?
[16:12:56] <habamax> I mean, it would be nice, indeed.
[16:13:33] <habamax> But vim doesn't work this way (maybe if you have closed vim before open a new one, then new one would load .viminfo with some register contents)
[16:13:47] <habamax> but this is not your case :)
[16:14:17] <joo> well my vim usually have the old recorded macros from previous sessions, and it also has the yank register from last sessions... right now when i paste it got what i put in my vimrc in the new session

[18:28:35] <habamax> you can grab all your strengths and come up with your own non-garbage producing indentexpr for html
[18:28:53] <habamax> that will include css and javascript

[18:30:01] <mort> or vs code with vim bindings

[19:27:37] <romainl> mort: what exactly do you want? the html indenting is fine so it is the js indenting that you want to be better? Better how? are the 8 columns tabs a problem?
[19:28:07] <mort> romainl: I want HTML indentetd properly. Embedded JavaScript in <script> tags, and embedded CSS in <style> tags, is part of HTML.
[19:28:38] <nova> mort, there are a couple of things you can do, but it is important in work and in play to not get so frustrated. vim supports setting indentexpr to an external tool which would be more suitable for indenting html and embedded javascipt.
[19:28:48] <mort> https://p.mort.coffee/OhO.png shows javascript embedded with 4 tabs per indentation level (or 16 spaces after zeraphel's setting changes)
[19:28:52] <mort> that's not right
[19:28:59] <nova> and you should especially not bite the hand that feeds you
[19:29:05] <romainl> Define "properly". Neither language have a specified standard indenting
[19:29:25] <mort> romainl: 16 spaces per indentation level isn't something anyone would consider "properly". I want something that's not absolutely ridiculous.
[19:29:47] <romainl> then tell what exactly you want
[19:29:49] <mort> it looks like javascript is getting quadruple-indented with htmlIndent
[19:29:55] <romainl> 2 spaces? 4?
[19:30:17] <romainl> did you read the linked help section on html indent?

[19:40:27] <romainl> mort: the solution is to use an alternative indent script that works the way you want, simple

[19:43:20] <habamax> ziftor: it is not about js per se, it is about js embedded into html
[19:43:22] <zeraphel> i actually like the way emacs handles embedding one language in another.  Shouldn't be too difficult to 'yank inside tags' paste in an empty buffer with a different filetype.
[19:43:37] <mort> it's about properly indenting html, simple as that
[19:43:57] <ziftor> https://pastebin.com/gNAXpwmp
[19:44:03] <ziftor> aha, so javascript inside html
[19:44:06] <ziftor> didn't try that one
[19:44:20] <mort> I also have working indentation with .js files, just not with .html files

[19:44:42] <romainl> I use that one
[19:45:07] <ziftor> mort: I would think that the problem stems from the fact that there it two languages in the same file and two different ways of indenting

[19:45:23] <mort> romainl: right, that one's also broken
[19:45:52] <mort> romainl:  https://p.mort.coffee/dzv.html - that's how html5's html.vim thinks javascript should be indented
[19:46:08] <mort> it's mostly okay, but the first line of js is indented further than the rest
[19:46:26] <ziftor> so i would say that there is no proper way of configuring vim to handle it out of the box without any plugins at least
[19:46:34] <mort> ziftor: it's literally just html
[19:46:44] <mort> html is one language which lets you embed javascript code
[19:46:54] <mort> any html indenter must support that

[19:47:02] <romainl> Vim's doesn't
[19:47:08] <mort> so vim's doesn't support actual html
[19:47:18] <romainl> fix it or open an issue
[19:47:21] <mort> it supports an extremely stripped-down subset of html which was easy to implement
[19:47:29] <mort> no thank you
[19:47:38] <ziftor> well, you could argue that you can embed anything inside html, so the problem is not really sentered around javascript per se
[19:48:10] <mort> I'm sure the vim maintainers already know that their indenter is completely broken and have decided not to fix it because it's easier to write a broken html indenter than a correct one
[19:48:11] <romainl> mort: then stop complaining
[19:48:15] <mort> no
[19:48:25] <ziftor> i mean, some javascript libraries send json inside tags, and some put various other templating languages inside tags
[19:48:26] <mort> hire me to fix vim and I'll gladly do it
[19:48:45] <nova> mort, k so I typed into google.com "vim html indent javascript" and clicked the first link for you https://stackoverflow.com/a/35027209. we get it. the defaults aren't great. there are plenty of work arounds
[19:48:46] <ziftor> it would be hard to implement all permutations without bloating everything for everyone else
[19:48:48] <zeraphel> mort: in any other editor you'll be replying on a standard language server.  You *can* use one in vim to get the same features. But you're refusing to.  vim is simple. it IS an advantage.
[19:49:09] <mort> nova: yeah, it suggests html5.vim, which also doesn't really work
[19:49:33] <romainl> another fix it or stop complaining
[19:49:44] <ziftor> also, one could argue from a security standpoint that you should not allow javascript inside html anyway, and that it should be blocked by Content-Security-Header etc
[19:49:45] <mort> no than kyou
[19:49:58] <mort> ziftor: no, you can't really argue that
[19:50:02] <mort> but that's also completely off topic

[19:50:52] <romainl> mort: maybe but that's how it works

[19:51:46] <strajder> ziftor: only now? lol
[19:51:56] <romainl> ziftor: I don't think it reached a constructive point
[19:52:09] <mort> I mean you're all arguing that the open-source development model is fundamentally broken
[19:52:18] <romainl> no
[19:52:23] <mort> I think open-source software *should* work, and that broken open-source software is a problem
[19:52:25] <ziftor> but i would think that this problem is better served through a vim plugin than being inside native vim
[19:52:25] <zeraphel> shgvbvri: looking nice.  do you use arch btw?
[19:52:25] <romainl> you are arguing that
[19:52:36] <mort> you all seem to think that it's completely fine that open-source software doesn't work because you can just fix it yourself
[19:52:55] <mort> romainl: nice "no u"
[19:53:02] <shgvbvri> zeraphel: surely, that's why I'm into the arch branch pointed by the statusline
[19:53:04] <habamax> "you all"
[19:53:18] <ziftor> well, to be honest, it works fine for me, so saying it is completely broken is probably a bit of a stretch
[19:53:25] <romainl> software that doesn't come with any guarantee explicit or implicit? yes, I don't expect it to work. I don't expect anything from it
[19:53:27] <shgvbvri> zeraphel: actually I use it on all my machines, pc, note, rpi, freescale
[19:53:36] <ziftor> but it could always be better in some way
[19:53:36] <mort> romainl: that's actually ridiculous
[19:53:38] <zeraphel> shgvbvri: mmh nice! i too use arch btw :-)
[19:53:48] <shgvbvri> :)
[19:53:59] <mort> romainl: you're literally arguing that one shouldn't expect open-source software to work, implying that open-source is a broken development model
[19:54:12] <romainl> yes
[19:54:31] <romainl> I personally don't give a flying fuck about open source
[19:54:33] <mort> "the open-source development model is one which produces software which doesn't work and which one should not even expect to work"
[19:54:33] <habamax> zeraphel, shgvbvri I use mammoth poo, named debian
[19:54:47] <mort> romainl: wait so why were you disagreeing with me earlier
[19:54:54] <romainl> most of the OSS I use and see is broken
[19:54:55] <nova> mort, are you still looking for a command-line tool to format html? Because I have a recommendation
[19:55:01] <mort> nova: never was
[19:55:02] <shgvbvri> habamax: ugh, even valve ditched that for arch
[19:55:21] <habamax> shgvbvri: if it works :)
[19:55:23] <zeraphel> habamax I thought you were a windows user primarily
[19:55:24] <mort> nova: but I'm still looking for a way to get vim to indent my HTML correctly
[19:55:39] <shgvbvri> habamax: imagine, a company of the size of valve, did s/debian/arch-btw/!
[19:55:41] <habamax> zeraphel: windows with WSL (and debian at home)
[19:55:50] <shgvbvri> debian is just for servers and just that
[19:56:07] <ziftor> mort: i believe it is indenting HTML correctly, but it doesn't know how to handle javascript inside html tags. That is the problem right?
[19:56:13] <habamax> shgvbvri: works for me though
[19:56:14] <gpanders> debian stable with Nix on top is actually not a bad combo
[19:56:16] <mort> ziftor: javascript inside HTML tags is part of HTML
[19:56:18] <gpanders> as a development machine
[19:56:26] <romainl> mort it's not
[19:56:29] <shgvbvri> habamax: well, then fine.
[19:56:29] <mort> romainl: it is
[19:56:33] <romainl> nope
[19:56:50] <nova> sudo pacman -S tidy  vim yomama.html   :set equalprg=tidy\ 2>/dev/null  gg=G  as mentioned, vim can use external tools to indent things because it's a difficult job and it's not *vim's* job. Instead vim is designed to be a modal editor that lets you edit text with text objects and ex-style commands efficiently
[19:56:56] <habamax> gpanders: good idea, actually
[19:56:59] <mort> romainl: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-script-element
[19:57:02] <mort> that's the HTML spec
[19:58:02] <mort> romainl: I don't think it says "warning: the <script> element is not part of the HTML spec, it's just here for fun, this is all non-normative" anywhere
[19:58:30] <ziftor> well, the spec doesn't say anything about how to format anything inside <script> tags, that technically, vim satisfies the spec
[19:58:42] <shgvbvri> mort: why keep bitching about this? it's worthless, even more on a irc channel, 100% no one gonna give a look at sources attempting to "fix" that, and you should use an external tool, because it's best to have one thing doing it well then vim trying to do too much.
[19:58:43] *** Joins: cavemanr (~cavemanr@227-135-067-156.ip-addr.inexio.net)
[19:58:59] <mort> ziftor: incorrect, actually
[19:59:04] <ziftor> why?
[19:59:14] <shgvbvri> vim is an editor, not a language formatter, you have proper tools for that.
[19:59:20] <mort> "The type attribute allows customization of the type of script represented: * Omitting the attribute, setting it to the empty string, or setting it to a JavaScript MIME type essence match, means that the script is a classic script, to be interpreted according to the JavaScript Script top-level production."
[20:00:13] <ziftor> well, yes, but that does even include minified javascript, so vim would still do "the right" thing if it always minified the javascript inside the tags
[20:00:34] <mort> granted, it defers that "javascript script top-level production" to the ecmascript spec, but it does explicitly refer to it
[20:00:35] <ziftor> and that wouldn't be helpful either, but it still obeys the standard
[20:00:37] <shgvbvri> I'm surely not trusting vim for formatting mostly, it's just a fancy feature to have builtin, I just expect it to work in a rather limited scope.
[20:00:59] <mort> shgvbvri: vim should let me hit enter and get a line that's somewhat reasonably indented
[20:01:02] <ziftor> agreed, formatting inside vim is still a best effort thing, and it can be extended with plugins
[20:01:03] <romainl> "refer to something" != "something is part of"
[20:01:06] <nova> vim could handle this better, but it doesn't. I see three options. You fork vim because no one is going to overhaul vim (yes, this would be a very nontrivial fix, and no, Bram would not merge this in unless it was extremely robust and played nicely with all of the other options and even then it wouldn't be POSIX compatible, so you would have to make sure this happened with only 'nocompatible' and then
[20:01:09] <nova> fix it for 'compatible' *breaths* etc etc etc). Or you can complain about it for an hour on irc. Or you can use an external tool.
[20:01:19] <mort> shgvbvri: or, lacking that, I should be able to hit enter and get a line that's at the same indentation level as the previous line
[20:01:29] <mort> that way I could hit tab or backspace myself to manage indentation
[20:01:39] <mort> the current state of vim makes me actively fight the indenter
[20:01:45] <ziftor> and I think there will never be full formatting for all permutations of formatting
[20:01:55] <shgvbvri> mort: which is precisely what it did in my gif workflow
[20:01:58] <romainl> fix it or stop complaining, again
[20:02:00] <nova> mort, if only you could set 'equalprg' so you didn't have to fight it!
[20:02:05] <nova> Oh wait...
[20:02:42] <shgvbvri> mort: when I've hit enter, it was all vim's job
[20:02:43] <mort> nova: does vim consult your equalprg program every time you hit enter....?
[20:02:45] <ziftor> anyways, i think i will have to go back to work
[20:02:48] <nova> or hey. guess what. you can write your own indentexpr (the default indentexpr is just a function someone made and stuck in $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/html.vim). Have fun! :)
[20:03:19] <mort> so, after a lot of completely useless arguing, we seem to have reached the conclusion that vim is just broken
[20:03:19] <shgvbvri> mort: happens at the end of the gif
[20:03:24] <habamax> nova, "no thank you"
[20:03:29] <habamax> been there
[20:03:31] <ziftor> nova: I believe that is the correct path to fix the matter
[20:03:47] <romainl> that Vim doesn't fit your expectations, mort
[20:03:57] <romainl> other editors do, use them
[20:03:58] <mort> I don't have months to spend writing an indenter currently, I'm very very sorry about that
[20:03:59] <shgvbvri> mort: it did the job fine on my side, after I have properly formatted the code, which is my duty.
[20:04:31] <habamax> who should do it then?

[20:06:57] <mort> actually broken, then I get told to just spend a few months to write an indenter myself

[20:15:55] <mort> shgvbvri: what's the magic sauce in your vim config which teaches vim how to indent properly
[20:16:09] <ziftor> mort: Anyway, "$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/html.vim" could probably be extended to handle javascript inside <script> tags better, but it clearly hasn't annoyed anyone enough to do something about it.
[20:16:11] <ziftor> I would not say that classifies the entire VIM as being broken. That would be like saying all roads are unusable because you have a pot hole right outside your driveway.
[20:17:02] * lopid can see messages but isn't letting on, teehee
[20:17:45] <shgvbvri> mort: external formatter + yaifa
[20:17:54] <mort> the external formatter is unnecessary right
[20:18:14] <mort> it's just a way to get an initial good format?
[20:18:27] <habamax> wait, we're still into this, after literally being sent far away
[20:18:54] <ziftor> but that raises a question actually: Can one set the filetype setting or whatever when encountering "<script" and revert it when it encounters "</script" ?
[20:19:10] <habamax> ziftor: no
[20:19:11] <shgvbvri> it is, because vim's runtime atm don't bother with format/indent of html+js+vb+whatever and I'm fine that it doesn't.
[20:19:29] <shgvbvri> I pick a proper tool for that.
[20:19:35] <shgvbvri> that simple
[20:19:42] <habamax> vim can include syntax into regions but not apply indentexprs of different filetypes
[20:19:59] <shgvbvri> the right tool for that job, that can parse js correctly, which is not a trivial thing.
[20:20:10] <habamax> so you have to have uber indentexpr handling all corner cases
[20:20:11] <mort> vim can parse js correctly
[20:20:17] <mort> for the most part
[20:20:24] <shgvbvri> ugh
[20:20:30] <shgvbvri> I don't trust it
[20:20:35] <phy1729> vim doesn't mix filetypes well
[20:20:46] <shgvbvri> it's just nonsense to trust it
[20:20:57] <shgvbvri> do you also trust it for rocket engines?
[20:21:01] <shgvbvri> I don't
[20:21:24] <ziftor> I work with web development, but I do not use vim as my primary editor for that
[20:21:43] <ziftor> I do like vim very much, but not for everything
[20:21:57] <ziftor> not as an universal editor for everything under the sun
[20:22:05] <shgvbvri> it is fine, if you pick it along a good toolset as companion
[20:22:11] <ziftor> true
[20:22:22] <mort> vim actually handles svelte really well, even though that has CSS, JS and HTML in the same file, because someone wrote a good svelte.vim file which handles both indentation and syntax
[20:22:34] <mort> s/syntax/& highlighting/ I suppose
[20:22:49] <ziftor> hmm, i haven't looked at svelte

[20:23:37] <ziftor> hmm
[20:24:12] <mort> to get the terminology right: is autoindent the feature where it automatically picks an indentation level when you hit enter?
[20:24:27] <ziftor> mort: out of curiosity. Can you use the svelte.vim thing for what you are trying to do?
[20:24:45] *** Joins: dld (~davidlowr@2620:6e:6000:2900:3c3c:cf45:60f2:8388)
[20:25:38] <mort> I don't think so, svelte is very particular; you have one top-level <script> tag with your javascript, one top-level <style> tag for your CSS, and one top-level <main> tag with your HTML

[20:38:17] <ziftor> and it seems to have run in compatible mode too. That was unpleasant

[20:40:41] <ziftor> mort: which line did you change?

[20:43:31] <ziftor> hmm, seems to come from "html_indent_script1" on line 122-126

[20:47:24] <mort> alright, so the fact that the previous line was indented confuses GetJavascriptIndent()
[20:47:42] <ziftor> hmm, looks a bit weird on the left there
[20:47:44] <mort> `return 2 + GetJavascriptIndent()` also makes javascript indent more than it should and not dedent enough
[20:47:58] <ziftor> could it be some cindent stuff are running at the same time?
[20:48:00] <mort> yeah, the left is how it looks out of the box for me
[20:48:13] <mort> I don't know how I check if cindent is running
[20:48:27] <ziftor> i suppose you could just try disabling it with ":set nocindent"
[20:48:40] <ziftor> just to be sure it's off
[20:48:40] *** Quits: jinie (~jimmy@188.114.173.37) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:49:08] <mort> that doesn't seem to make a difference
[20:49:15] <mort> nor does :set cindent
[20:49:17] <ziftor> hmm, ok, maybe it was off already then
[20:49:50] <ziftor> ok, then maybe it doesn't matter then. I am not an expert, but i thought it at least could be something to check
[20:50:26] *** Joins: jinie (~jimmy@188.114.173.37)
[20:50:41] <ziftor> hmm, i actually liked that javascript started out without indent in your right view there

[20:50:53] <mort> yeah, I prefer it that way too
[20:50:59] <mort> it's how CSS is by default I believe
[20:51:06] *** Joins: throwinsmoke[m] (~throwinsm@2001:470:69fc:105::bad2)
[20:51:16] <ziftor> at least it prevents it from horizontal scrolling :)
[20:51:16] <mort> except that with CSS, the <style> tag itself gets dropped to the left side rather than its contents
[20:51:43] <mort> my guess is that GetJavascriptIndent() looks at the indentation level of the previous line to figure out stuff about the current line, so when something else has modified the previous line without it knowing, GetJavascriptIndent() gets confused
[20:51:55] *** Joins: Guest5 (~Guest5@112.96.100.167)
[20:52:17] <mort> because replacing `return eval(b:hi_js1indent) + GetJavascriptIndent()` with `return 2 + GetJavascriptIndent()` also confuses it so it can't be an issue with the b:hi_js1indent variable
[20:52:18] <ziftor> hmm, I had some problems once where it was a file with mixed tab and spaces for indentation
[20:52:36] <ziftor> that totally messed with the autodetection and created all sort of weird problems
[20:52:53] <mort> I visualize my tabs (that's the >--- stuff in my screenshots) so I know I'm consistently using tabs

[23:52:30] <wwalker> Something changed.  I will bisect later to determine what.  in the mean time, how can I force vim to redraw the window?  I've done both ^l and :redraw.  It only actually redraws the window if I resize the window... :-(

[23:58:39] <hajonnes>  How do I let the clipboard in ubuntu use the same clipboard as in vim. Permanent setting i.e. setting in .vimrc.
[23:59:07] <hajonnes> Also I have tried vim in ubuntu and "+ and "* does not work, do you know what is wrong?
