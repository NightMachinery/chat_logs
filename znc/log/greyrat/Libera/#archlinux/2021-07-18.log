[09:02:24] <voxelv> switching subjects... how about that Steam Deck? I bet it can run Arch :D
[09:02:59] <Betal> it will be arch based

[18:06:43] <NetSysFire> *shouldnt
[18:06:54] <NetSysFire> if your device is not remembering boot entries, something has gone wrong
[18:07:16] <NetSysFire> make sure its visible via efibootmgr -v, reboot and if its still gone it might be a harder problem to solve

[20:46:33] <bezirg> I have two issues with the wiki section at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive/NVMe#Power_Saving_(APST)> . First issue: it is implied that the default value of the kernel parameter `nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us` is 25000. The linux-5.12 source says instead that it is 100000 <https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.17/source/drivers/nvme/host/core.c#L51> and I have manually verified it to be 100000
