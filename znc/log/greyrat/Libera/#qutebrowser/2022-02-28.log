[17:41:12] <The-Compiler> more or less back from holidays, looks like things were rather quiet here :D
[17:41:45] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: re logging from config.py, I suppose that should work, but why?
[17:42:38] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: re mypy, I'm not sure if the snippet was intended for that (as opposed to things like PyCharm). Then again I don't really see a benefit of running mypy over a config.py.
[17:48:14] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m], toofar: Also see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5233 re notification permissions - from what it sounds like, it should be possible for qutebrowser to pass existing permissions to QtWebEngine when it starts or so.
[17:49:16] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: networking stuff is handled by the underlying Chromium, so with the same cache, you would likely see the same there too. No idea what exactly is going on...
[17:50:49] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m]: there is a PR with improved scrolling via JS, unfortunately QtWebEngine's API is rather limiting and I haven't had a chance to take a closer look at the PR so far
[17:51:17] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: can't you just disallow geolocation for the other websites and allow it for that one?
[17:53:43] <The-Compiler> scara: see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4102 re container support - it won't be as automatic like in firefox, but basic support should be possible (i.e. selecting a storage profile for a window or tab), and it would be great to have...
[17:54:29] <wasamasa> the problem is that geoaccuracy is really bad
[17:54:48] <wasamasa> like, 50km off
[17:59:10] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m]: hints indeed don't update if element positions change. Not sure if it's feasible for them to do in this case. I added a comment to https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/1928 for it.

[18:01:15] <The-Compiler> nimaje: what backend, qutebrowser version, and Qt version? (:version)
[18:02:01] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: So Chromium uses some Google APIs for geolocation, which IIRC knows things like where your WiFi is located
[18:02:39] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: QtWebEngine does not, it uses Geoclue instead on Linux. So you might need to set that up properly. I suppose you could make it return a hardcoded value in some way.
[18:03:03] <wasamasa> yeah, I wondered whether I could hack up something with JS to always return a hardcoded value
[18:03:10] <wasamasa> if scammers can do it, why can't I do
[18:03:36] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: I'd just find a way to set up https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/wikis/home to return a hardcoded value
[18:03:55] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: but yeah, maybe you can get it to work with some JS hackery via Greasemonkey too, dunno
[18:06:16] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/issues/51 seems to have a lot of discussion but no real solution apparently?
