[00:12:03] <vitali64matrix> leah: try it!
[00:12:07] <leah> i will
[00:12:31] <leah> newer intel machines in libreboot would be a huge boon to the project
[00:12:56] <leah> pretty much cement its positions for more years to come
[00:13:19] <leah> currently supported platforms in libreboot are very hard to find nowadays if you actually want to buy machines that are compatible
[00:14:14] <leah> if this is possible on those newer gen machines, then i won't be surprised if i find something is possible on earlier platforms
[00:14:51] <leah> currently, ivybridge and sandybridge platforms (circa 2012) in coreboot are 100% libre code, but you need the neutered ME firmware
[00:15:14] <leah> and as such, libreboot policy prohibits such boards being added
[00:15:50] <leah> when me_cleaner became a thing, i considered abandoning said policy but thought better of it (i made another project instead)
[00:16:03] <leah> later made one, that is
[00:16:24] <leah> thing is, ivy boots and works just fine during those 30 minutes

[00:19:40] <vitali64matrix> Right?
[00:19:47] <leah> that person on that thread probably notices "no ill effects" because they're a desktop user

[00:20:12] <leah> i assume not
[00:20:15] <leah> the ME is pretty baked in
[00:20:25] <leah> lack of such things on desktops is probably not that critical
[00:20:30] <leah> but like
[00:20:32] <leah> what if your fan fails
[00:21:12] <leah> in that case, i'd probably modify the mainboard. like, make a circuit with some transistors where if fan stops, the system shuts off
[00:21:16] <leah> if that's even possible

[00:21:49] <vitali64matrix> Gotta go
[00:22:10] <leah> on older platforms it's done in x86. i'm not sure if you could still do that on newer machines

[00:23:33] <vitali64matrix> leah: but what about my EliteBook 8560w
[00:23:39] <leah> when your system overheats, it's supposed to shut off
[00:23:45] <leah> on newer intel platforms, this is done by the ME
[00:24:03] <vitali64matrix> leah: yep
[00:24:09] <leah> but assuming your thermal paste is good, i assume it'll only overheat if the heatsink is insufficient, or if the fan malfunctions
[00:24:12] <vitali64matrix> leah: even Sandy Bridge?
[00:24:16] <leah> and you could construct a circuit to detect when the fail fails
[00:24:18] <leah> and like
[00:24:31] <leah> for power coming into the board, re-route it through that control circuit
[00:24:42] <leah> it would be janky as hell but you could probably do something like that
[00:24:47] <vitali64matrix> leah: yeah
[00:24:52] <leah> sorry, i meant when the fan fails
[00:24:58] <leah> fail can't fail

[00:34:53] <vitali64matrix> Could we  like , cut power of that?
[00:35:01] <epony> older ones are ISA newer ones are doubled with SoC / Chipset / in-CPU logic
[00:35:18] <vitali64matrix> Or cut power to the iME physically?
[00:35:41] <epony> but the actual sensors pass through the super-io chipset on mainboard and the management engine just polls the superio chipset for i2c bus statuses
[00:35:48] <epony> so is a wrap around, not a provider
[00:35:56] <leah> so you could still do it

[02:50:57] <epony> vboykox, that's the shell on plan9?
[02:50:59] <epony> rc init scripts are standard shell in posix / korn shell variants typically
[02:51:03] <epony> posix is korn shell
[02:51:05] <epony> bsd systems use the rc scripts as standard shell, sysv systems use later shells like bash after the 90ies
[02:51:07] <epony> so it's a question of BSD (korn) shell POSIX scripts, or SYSV (at&t) shell POSIX/non-POSIX scripts
[02:51:09] <epony> the POSIX mode of shells is a subset of both the SH mode which is a subset of the full SHELL modes
[02:51:11] <epony> bash is bourne shell
[02:51:13] <epony> post sysv changes use binary init system which is not POSIX and not UNIX compatible

[06:17:28] <iShareFreedom> you are trying to make steps in the freedom ladder to have freedom in your computing?
[06:17:40] <earthling_> considering it
[06:17:49] <iShareFreedom> you deserve freedom dude,
[06:18:08] <earthling_> Is ubuntu still free?
[06:18:13] <iShareFreedom> if you run nonfree software you are a victim becouse you dont have control or you dont know what realy doing!
[06:18:16] <iShareFreedom> ofcourse not
[06:18:25] <iShareFreedom> ubuntu is a propietary distribution of GNU/Linux
[06:18:25] <damo22> last time i checked, ubuntu has nonfree software
[06:18:26] <earthling_> manjaro?
[06:18:36] <iShareFreedom> manjaro is propietary distribution of GNU/Linux

[06:19:15] <irelativism> use trisquel for ubunto replacement
[06:19:16] <iShareFreedom> freedom isnt something popular earthling_
[06:19:24] <iShareFreedom> linux?
[06:19:28] <earthling_> operating system
[06:19:29] <iShareFreedom> GNU dude! 
[06:19:34] <iShareFreedom> GNU is a operating system
[06:19:35] <irelativism> some other have better freedom standarts though like parabola and hyperbola
[06:19:43] <iShareFreedom> linux, is just a kernel with nonfree software.
[06:20:01] <iShareFreedom> licenses as a free software, but arent free software becouse you cant study all the source code of it
[06:20:07] <earthling_> what about debian?
[06:20:11] <irelativism> earthling_: use trisquel or pureos for user frienflyness
[06:20:11] <iShareFreedom> the same
[06:20:21] <damo22> i thought debian with main only is free
[06:20:24] <iShareFreedom> debian distribute, support and share nonfree software
[06:20:32] <iShareFreedom> so debian arent a recommended distribution
[06:21:04] <iShareFreedom> here you can find the distributions recommended for have freedom in computing earthling_ https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[06:21:14] <irelativism> earthling_: > https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html
[06:22:13] <irelativism> "earthling_: use trisquel or pureos for user frienflyness"
[06:22:13] <earthling_> some of those are based on debian and arch
[06:22:17] <earthling_> a modified version?
[06:22:26] <iShareFreedom> no modify versions
[06:22:27] <earthling_> or just the core
[06:22:30] <iShareFreedom> no
[06:22:49] <irelativism> "earthling_: have you checked the free software free society tedxgeneva talk?"
[06:22:51] <iShareFreedom> are distributions of GNU ok, but are different to debian
[06:22:53] <iShareFreedom> or ubuntu,
[06:22:55] <earthling_> irelativism, no
[06:23:00] <iShareFreedom> the best word to say it is "based"
[06:23:21] <iShareFreedom> in any case, trisquel is the replacement to Ubuntu
[06:23:38] <iShareFreedom> and the replacement to debian is PureOS
[06:23:48] <damo22> what is the status of Fedora?
[06:23:49] <iShareFreedom> replacement to Arch is Parabola
[06:23:53] <iShareFreedom> fedora propietary too
[06:23:59] <earthling_> I am most familiar with debian, so perhaps Trisquel...hmm
[06:24:06] <earthling_> ubuntu i mean
[06:24:06] <irelativism> you should to understand why this is so important > https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM
[06:24:08] <iShareFreedom> the only recommended distributions are: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html damo22
[06:24:23] <iShareFreedom> trisquel is your way earthling
[06:24:30] <iShareFreedom> and now we have the version 10 of Trisquel
[06:24:36] <iShareFreedom> based in ubunt 20.01 if im not wrong
[06:24:37] <iShareFreedom> :)
[06:24:49] <damo22> iShareFreedom: that is very black and white, but im sure there are other distros that are almost free
[06:24:50] <iShareFreedom> fully free as in freedom software
[06:25:04] <iShareFreedom> or you are free or you are not damo22
[06:25:14] <irelativism> you should to understand why this is so important > https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM

[06:25:16] <earthling_> irelativism, I've listened to stallman for many years, I know his pitch
[06:25:25] <iShareFreedom> no damo22 the only distributions are free as in freedom completly are in: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html

[06:25:48] <earthling_> ok
[06:25:59] <damo22> i mean, its good to recommend 100% free distros, but in practice some people are not ready to give up proprietary firmware for their hardware
[06:26:02] <irelativism> Cheers
[06:26:03] <irelativism> if you have
[06:26:03] <iShareFreedom> you can know his spech
[06:26:19] <iShareFreedom> but dont have the freedom of the free software
[06:26:31] <iShareFreedom> in the practices damo22 all users deserve freedom
[06:26:48] <irelativism> damo22: that is true ,that is why it is important to choose right hardware\
[06:26:52] <iShareFreedom> why? becouse nonfree is inmoral 
[06:26:57] <iShareFreedom> and a social injustice

[06:27:24] <iShareFreedom> if you are moving to buy a new hardware i recommend search in https://h-node.org/
[06:27:27] <Whistler> fedora is free if you remove some firmware rpms and a number of kernel modules
[06:27:33] <irelativism> https://h-node.org/ is a great resource for that
[06:27:33] <iShareFreedom> no Whistler
[06:27:44] <iShareFreedom> Fedora isnt fully free becouse they use nonfree software in the kernel
[06:27:51] <damo22> Whistler: i agree with you
[06:27:52] <iShareFreedom> and they promote install nonfree software
[06:28:08] <iShareFreedom> thats wrong becouse fedora promote, share and support nonfree software
[06:28:08] <earthling_> damo22, having different machines for different purposes might be a compromise for the time being
[06:28:11] <Whistler> there are no non-free software in fedora repo except some firmware packages.
[06:28:16] <irelativism> **  they use nonfree software in the kernel==irelativism
[06:28:24] <iShareFreedom> firmware is software whistler and that is propietary software
[06:28:30] <Whistler> and the only few blobs in the linux kernel tree can be removed by just rm -f some .ko files.
[06:29:07] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: **  they use nonfree software in the kernel==remove some firmware rpms and a number of kernel modules so its not "no"
[06:29:08] <iShareFreedom> that is the reason Fedora is propietary distribution
[06:29:35] <irelativism> Whistler: is right
[06:29:37] <iShareFreedom> the only free distributions are: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[06:29:43] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: is wrong
[06:30:02] <iShareFreedom> irelativism you relativism dont work in the way to share freedom
[06:30:04] <irelativism> that might not be a possibility for new users
[06:30:11] <iShareFreedom> you are trying to share nonfree software and that is completly inmoral
[06:30:23] <iShareFreedom> all users, technicals or not deserve have freedom.
[06:30:25] <irelativism> sure
[06:30:26] <damo22> iShareFreedom: its good to recommend 100% free software to others, but you are telling people they cant be free if they take measures on their own to be free
[06:30:30] <iShareFreedom> and how you can get freedom in your computing?
[06:30:35] <irelativism> u are funny
[06:30:40] <iShareFreedom> with only free software, software what respect the users freedom
[06:30:45] <earthling_> there must be 1000s of operating systems
[06:30:48] <iShareFreedom> becouse, what is the idea of freesoftware? 
[06:30:52] <earthling_> or 100s
[06:30:55] <iShareFreedom> the idea of free software is have the control of your computing
[06:31:12] <iShareFreedom> and you only can have it exclusively with free software.
[06:31:15] <irelativism> you sound like a regurgitating machine :)
[06:31:24] <earthling_> freedom is a great ideal to aim for, but we live in a messy world
[06:31:31] <iShareFreedom> right now
[06:31:41] <iShareFreedom> all computing you need to do are completly in free software
[06:31:52] <iShareFreedom> you can do all your computing right now using only free software.
[06:31:55] <earthling_> and what about your ISP they probably use properietary software
[06:32:05] <damo22> earthling_: yes, right now i use fedora because i can control how much firmware i use that is proprietary and the rest is free, its a compromise but im willing to do it
[06:32:07] <iShareFreedom> if they use nonfree software they dont have freedom

[06:35:43] <irelativism> speaking about it ==promoting
[06:35:55] <iShareFreedom> is 100& free software but the best for new users is Trisquel or PureOS
[06:36:02] <irelativism> that is true "hyperbola isnt a good distro for new users"
[06:36:17] <iShareFreedom> all users deserve freedom
[06:36:23] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: what you need to understand is the reason why permissive licensing existes
[06:36:25] <earthling_> irelativism, what about Trisquel?
[06:36:27] <iShareFreedom> so you never can promote nonfree software dude, that is completly imoral

[06:37:46] <irelativism> damo22: that is respectfull
[06:38:02] <irelativism> to old?
[06:38:03] <irelativism> why you cant buy such hardware?
[06:38:08] <iShareFreedom> damo22 why you dont use 100% free distros?

[06:38:25] <damo22> im using a W520 right now

[06:40:41] <earthling_> cool
[06:40:57] <earthling_> wonder if he changed since
[06:41:02] <irelativism> I also use T60 a lot
[06:41:03] <irelativism> and macbook2.1
[06:41:06] <iShareFreedom> can be cool you using free software as who only run free software distros, like https://trisquel.info/ 
[06:41:08] <damo22> irelativism: i helped write the sandy coreboot port
[06:41:11] <irelativism> and my mooded LIBREBOOK
[06:41:13] <Whistler> nowadays rms uses Thinkpad T400s.
[06:41:20] <iShareFreedom> whistler
[06:41:29] <iShareFreedom> he use a new one
[06:41:33] <irelativism> i helped write the sandy coreboot port
[06:41:33] <irelativism> irelativism cool! thanks
[06:41:45] <iShareFreedom> coreboot isnt 100% free
[06:41:46] <Whistler> speak of lemote yeelong, it's too bad that loongson no longer release their boot firmware as free software :(
[06:41:50] <iShareFreedom> the free is LibreBoot
[06:42:06] <iShareFreedom> ph yes is the t400s
[06:42:11] <iShareFreedom> https://tehnoetic.com/tet-t400s
[06:42:14] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: regurgitating gnu website is not helping 
[06:42:22] <Whistler> loongson's latest uefi boot firmware is non-free
[06:42:25] <iShareFreedom> if dont help you try to do something better
[06:42:27] <damo22> coreboot is free if you only compile the ones without blobs
[06:42:39] <irelativism> Libreboot is run by a unstable person
[06:42:42] <iShareFreedom> that is a possibility
[06:42:44] <irelativism> I wouldnt trust it
[06:42:47] <iShareFreedom> no a free
[06:42:55] <iShareFreedom> no a freedom, just a posibility of freedom
[06:42:58] <iShareFreedom> that mean, nonfree
[06:43:14] <iShareFreedom> thats the reason RYF certification only works with libreboot :)
[06:43:19] <irelativism> you can make it free :s
[06:43:27] <iShareFreedom> ryf.fsf.org
[06:43:32] <iShareFreedom> only libreboot 
[06:43:44] <irelativism> you are speaking about with no alteration
[06:44:03] <irelativism> how do you think libreboot does it?
[06:44:06] <irelativism> libreboot is just a distribution of coreboot
[06:44:09] <iShareFreedom> im speaking about the features of the respect your freedom certifications
[06:44:17] <earthling_> Whistler, and Thinkpad is owned by Lenovo, a chinese company....not sure if many chinese companies would allow free software
[06:44:31] <iShareFreedom> coreboot is like debian, and libreboot more like trisquel for example irelativism
[06:44:32] <irelativism> you can reproduce what "libredhoot" does on your own
[06:44:52] <iShareFreedom> only with libreboot you can have a respect your freedom certification
[06:44:56] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[06:45:13] <iShareFreedom> if you want buy hardware what respect your freedom https://ryf.fsf.org :)
[06:45:24] <earthling_> ok
[06:45:40] <damo22> iShareFreedom: FSF cannot recommend anything that suggests/has nonfree software by default... but that doesnt mean you cant have freedom without these things, you can be free if you take manual steps to ensure you are not running any nonfree software 
[06:45:43] <iShareFreedom> that is the objetive in the freedom ladder
[06:45:43] <Whistler>  earthling_ : chinese companies are no difference from american companies - they make computers preloaded with windows and you can install GNU/Linux onto it afterwards. but... f*ck microsoft tax
[06:45:59] <iShareFreedom> a lot of people here are trying to say "ey dude the freedom ladder is just install debian" LOL?
[06:46:45] <Whistler> also, lenovo only sells computers preloaded with GNU/Linux in US and Europe but not in China
[06:46:47] <iShareFreedom> the objetive is run only free software, that mean recommended distributions like trisquel,  and run only free software, too thats mean dont run nonfree software in javascript
[06:47:02] <irelativism> libreboot is not comparable to coreboot
[06:47:04] <iShareFreedom> then other things like, hardware issues like intel me or the amd issue, 
[06:47:04] <irelativism> libreboot is just a distribution
[06:47:05] <irelativism> coreboot is were the actual work lies
[06:47:06] <irelativism> and again libreboot has seem a hostile takeover by an less stable person, so you might not want to trust the new buildsystem
[06:47:06] <irelativism> lbmk
[06:47:09] <iShareFreedom> ooh you!
[06:47:33] <iShareFreedom> you dont understend why ryf.fsf.org dont support coreboot?
[06:47:42] <iShareFreedom> becouse dont respect the users freedom! 
[06:47:52] <iShareFreedom> is better than completly propietary bios?
[06:47:54] <iShareFreedom> ofcourse!
[06:47:56] <damo22> google ships coreboot on chromebooks by default
[06:47:58] <iShareFreedom> but isnt the objetive!
[06:48:04] <iShareFreedom> the objetive is libreboot,
[06:48:06] <damo22> they contain blobs
[06:48:54] <iShareFreedom> coreboot always have blobs by default thats the reason only libreboot are recommended by the respect your freedom certification
[06:49:12] <damo22> not true
[06:49:16] <iShareFreedom> ooh haha
[06:49:20] *** Joins: stetner (~stetner@stetner.org)
[06:49:20] <iShareFreedom> if that is a lie
[06:49:22] <damo22> not every coreboot port is nonfre
[06:49:24] <iShareFreedom> why coreboot arent
[06:49:31] <iShareFreedom> in the ryf.fsf.org?
[06:49:31] <damo22> only some contain blobs
[06:49:40] <damo22> i wrote some
[06:49:40] <labrador> I dunno I understand leah's reasoning in keeping those blobs for osboot
[06:49:41] <iShareFreedom> some propietary software aka malware!
[06:50:04] <labrador> Because the FSF doesn't have trouble with microcode burned on the rom
[06:50:09] <iShareFreedom> this type of conversatiosn dont happen in gnu chat haha
[06:50:34] <labrador> But it does care about microcode updates
[06:50:41] <damo22> some of the coreboot targets are 100% free, that is why libreboot can exist
[06:50:58] <damo22> but not all
[06:50:58] <labrador> This just makes librebooted computers buggy and/or vulnerable
[06:51:30] <iShareFreedom> that isnt a reason for run coreboot becouse coreboot is weak for respect your freedom certification so, that doesnt exist in laptops with the certification why? becouse they only run with libreboot
[06:51:33] <damo22> if all the coreboot targets had no blobs, RYF could endorse coreboot
[06:51:35] <irelativism> some of the coreboot targets are 100% free, that is why libreboot can exist ^^
[06:52:02] <irelativism> damo22: have you heard about hyperbolabsd project?
[06:52:09] <iShareFreedom> RYF certification is the objetive
[06:52:17] <iShareFreedom> stop kicking off the freedom ladder!
[06:52:21] <iShareFreedom> you dont see the META?
[06:52:32] <labrador> RYF certification is arbitrary iShareFreedom 
[06:52:41] <labrador> Its not the 'end'
[06:52:45] <damo22> irelativism: no
[06:52:50] <iShareFreedom> you dont see a objetive
[06:52:59] <iShareFreedom> just promoting debian/fedora?
[06:53:02] <iShareFreedom> guys!
[06:53:02] <irelativism> you should check it out
[06:53:07] <iShareFreedom> please! haha
[06:53:28] <irelativism> damo22: copyleft version of openBSD in the works
[06:53:34] <damo22> wow
[06:53:44] <labrador> The point is
[06:53:49] <labrador> Parabola wont even run
[06:53:54] <labrador> Debian will
[06:53:59] <iShareFreedom> haha
[06:54:01] <iShareFreedom> that is kickoff
[06:54:03] <irelativism> damo22: ultimate privacy<-security<-freedom
[06:54:15] <irelativism> is still a work in progress though
[06:54:33] <iShareFreedom> all users deserve have the control of their computers
[06:54:37] <damo22> bbl
[06:54:47] <iShareFreedom> and that only can happen with exclusively free software
[06:55:02] <damo22> iShareFreedom: you mean well, but you sound like a broken record
[06:55:03] <irelativism> damo22: https://itsfoss.com/hyperbola-linux-bsd/
[06:55:03] <iShareFreedom> that mean never install debian, becouse you have a replacement, Trisquel and PureOS
[06:55:14] <irelativism> agree
[06:55:23] <iShareFreedom> damo22 if you lisent a broken record is becouse you dont believe it
[06:55:27] <irelativism> a regurgitating broken record
[06:55:31] <iShareFreedom> thats the reason you run nonfree software
[06:55:43] <iShareFreedom> becouse you dont believe it like was something serious
[06:55:45] <iShareFreedom> thats all
[06:55:49] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: I have a question for you
[06:55:50] <labrador> Like look at this from a saner perspective,the point is running free OS with blobs > running windows. 
[06:55:54] <labrador> Just so happens
[06:55:58] <labrador> Most people NEED blobs
[06:56:03] <labrador> So debian is popular
[06:56:06] <labrador> Simple
[06:56:06] <iShareFreedom> if you want run your computer with all the features
[06:56:12] <iShareFreedom> you need isntall normaly
[06:56:14] <iShareFreedom> windows,
[06:56:21] <irelativism> do you thinks the founders of this movement didnt use nonfree software in 90s?
[06:56:21] <iShareFreedom> but windows are trashing your freedom!
[06:56:36] <damo22> i was running windows in 1997
[06:56:37] <iShareFreedom> so you need move to freedom, and that mean be against propietary software aka malware.
[06:56:54] <labrador> irelativism, very good point
[06:56:59] <labrador> Before the linux kernel
[06:57:11] <labrador> GNU was run on proprietary kernels
[06:57:19] <iShareFreedom> isnt important for me the others freedom, becouse i dont attack the freedoms of the others irelativism
[06:57:30] <irelativism> damo22:  check this interview out https://itsfoss.com/hyperbola-linux-bsd/ they explain the project well
[06:57:36] <damo22> thanks will do later
[06:57:47] <irelativism> :thumbs up
[06:57:49] <iShareFreedom> against that, i support the others freedom showing the objetive; running exclusively free software.
[06:58:01] <labrador> iShareFreedom, the point is a lot cannot
[06:58:11] <labrador> While not severely ruining functionality
[06:58:12] <iShareFreedom> if you cannot
[06:58:20] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: the issue is that you disregard the reason why permissive licensed projects exist
[06:58:29] <iShareFreedom> you need run the most free software you can
[06:58:37] *** Quits: geowiesnot (~user@5-51-190-244.abo.bbox.fr) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:58:40] <iShareFreedom> but that is insufficent for your freedom
[06:58:53] <iShareFreedom> so, the best you can do, is sell your hardware becouse are defective by design
[06:59:01] <irelativism> sadly our movement havent come up with productive and FOSS compatible business models
[06:59:03] <iShareFreedom> and buy a new hardware who can run free software as Trisquel
[06:59:05] <labrador> Not really,you can move up whenever you want
[06:59:09] <iShareFreedom> and if dont un your wifi caard
[06:59:18] <iShareFreedom> go and buy a ethernet cable, is a good replacement
[06:59:21] <labrador> No need for pressuring others
[06:59:32] <iShareFreedom> if others dont want have freedom
[06:59:38] <iShareFreedom> that isnt a issue about what i do
[06:59:42] <iShareFreedom> is about issue about others do
[06:59:42] <labrador> iShareFreedom, for you. Others cannot plug a ethernet cable into their laptop
[06:59:44] <Whistler> I do think everyone here agree with the vision of fsf, but... we are still living in an imperfect world.  if you decide not to use non-free software it's indeed cool
[07:00:11] <iShareFreedom> isnt just cool
[07:00:14] <iShareFreedom> is what you deserve
[07:00:17] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: the issue is that you disregard the reason why permissive licensed projects exist, sadly our movement havent come up with productive and FOSS compatible business models, there are new solution coming up for that though.
[07:00:21] <iShareFreedom> so you need move to the freedom becouse you deserve it
[07:00:36] <iShareFreedom> i dont say foss
[07:00:51] <iShareFreedom> and i not promote foss things, and im not part of foss philosophy or community of foss users
[07:01:01] <irelativism> wouldnt be hard to guess that
[07:01:12] <damo22> iShareFreedom: "you deserve freedom, INSTALL TRISQUEL NOW!!!" not a good way to encourage 
[07:01:14] <irelativism> you are loking more and more a cult member :s
[07:01:24] <irelativism> where logic fails to exist
[07:01:34] <labrador> damo22, yeah that will just make people run away from you
[07:01:39] <iShareFreedom> but, if you need run nonfree software for use your laptop, image that, your hardware only works with nonfree software
[07:01:59] <iShareFreedom> you can install debian in it, for use it, but the best you can do, is sell it and buy hardware who support free software
[07:02:18] <iShareFreedom> but anyway if you want all features of your hardware, you go to move to windows
[07:02:29] <iShareFreedom> but windows is trash becouse they compare you freedom to trash!
[07:02:40] <damo22> the point of the freedom ladder is that its a compromise, you have to run what you are comfortable running, but at the same time be informed that your choices impact your freedom
[07:02:41] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: I have a honest and deeply important question for you. Why do you think "Open Source" exists?
[07:02:42] <iShareFreedom> so, yo need take a position here
[07:02:58] <iShareFreedom> or you are against propietary software
[07:03:04] <iShareFreedom> of you are pro freedom users.
[07:03:26] <iShareFreedom> im not part of opensource, and im not promoting it and i dont speak about it
[07:03:32] <labrador> ok ok
[07:03:38] <labrador> but opensource is needed
[07:03:39] <irelativism> I not asking that
[07:03:42] <earthling_> 383 chatters
[07:03:44] <labrador> to promote it to companies
[07:03:52] <earthling_> oops wrong channel
[07:03:55] <iShareFreedom> i sell free software
[07:04:04] <irelativism> I asking what are the reasons you think make it a thing? iShareFreedom 
[07:04:08] <labrador> uh good?

[07:04:48] <irelativism> try to answer my question and you might realise my point
[07:04:49] <iShareFreedom> is you maybe dont believe what realy is free software, and a lot of people always are trying to change the real means about free as in freedom
[07:05:21] <irelativism> I only use foss on my machines no proprietary software on me
[07:05:33] <irelativism> but please answer my question
[07:05:40] <irelativism> you might get my point
[07:05:41] <iShareFreedom> what is your question
[07:06:01] <iShareFreedom> can you repeat it?
[07:06:17] <irelativism> "iShareFreedom: I have a honest and deeply important question for you. Why do you think "Open Source" exists?
[07:06:17] <irelativism> I asking what are the reasons you think make it a thing? iShareFreedom"
[07:06:35] <iShareFreedom> i dont speak about opensource becouse is redundant
[07:06:37] <irelativism> not promoting it not endorsing it
[07:06:38] <labrador> It exists to promote free software to companies
[07:07:01] <irelativism> just asking what reasons you think created it?
[07:07:12] <iShareFreedom> for me free software is the only term for defend users freedom, and defend the 4 freedoms, freedom to run modify study share distribute and redistribute
[07:07:15] <irelativism> "It exists to promote free software to companies" exactly
[07:07:25] <irelativism> and why do you think that is?
[07:07:35] <iShareFreedom> so, the answer is, for me opesouce is a term redundant for Free Software
[07:07:38] <labrador> Because companies aren't humans
[07:07:44] <iShareFreedom> and is a way to kick off the ideals of Freedom
[07:07:46] <labrador> They cannot understand freedom
[07:07:54] <iShareFreedom> yes
[07:07:55] <iShareFreedom> they do
[07:08:03] <irelativism> you are not answering my question :s
[07:08:10] <iShareFreedom> companies only can be in a free as in freedom market

[07:12:51] <labrador> indeed,there's socialism too
[07:12:53] <iShareFreedom> capitalism is freedom to do all your want for your own life with the first of no aggression
[07:12:54] <labrador> Its a good model

[07:30:21] <irelativism> use of free/libre software in this business models. so that is exactly what we need to fix nothing else. So do you now understand why most people dont use 100 free/libre software?
[07:30:31] <iShareFreedom> is a model of trade

[07:49:47] <irelativism> I just trying you to prove you wrong
[07:50:00] <iShareFreedom> im pro capitalism dude
[07:50:00] <irelativism> with based arguments
[07:50:02] <irelativism> but you need to listen for that :)
[07:50:08] <iShareFreedom> your arguments are inmoral for me
[07:50:23] <irelativism> stop derailing the conversations
[07:50:27] <iShareFreedom> try to make arguments for a conversative one
[07:50:42] <irelativism> I dont care about capitalism/communism
[07:50:57] <iShareFreedom> see
[07:51:02] <irelativism> or whathever boxes you might put me or even your self for that matter
[07:51:11] <iShareFreedom> i dont want know what you are trying to say me realy, 
[07:51:17] <irelativism> so you wish to listen to my original point?
[07:51:19] <iShareFreedom> i just trying to defend my ideals
[07:51:33] <iShareFreedom> against your arguments
[07:51:38] <irelativism> before you starting assuming my position and going off about nonsens?
[07:51:47] <Andrew> Hmm...
[07:52:16] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:52:21] <irelativism> "i just trying to defend my ideals
[07:52:21] <irelativism> against your arguments" you need to listen first given you dont know what my "arguments are?"
[07:52:24] <earthling_> Linus Torvalds father is communist
[07:52:39] <irelativism> you are justa assuming you do iShareFreedom you see?
[07:52:43] <earthling_> studied in Moscow
[07:52:54] <iShareFreedom> not all different position are nonseens becouse you dont share it irelativism
[07:53:03] <irelativism> btw iShareFreedom assumption count:14
[07:53:05] <iShareFreedom> earthling_ maybe thats the reason linus have nonfree software in their kernel
[07:53:16] <iShareFreedom> xD
[07:53:38] <earthling_> Torvalds was bullied because of his father's politics
[07:53:39] <irelativism> the nonsense is not the position is the inability to discuss a topic in a based a listenning manner
[07:54:02] <irelativism> so far nothing has been discussed
[07:54:28] <iShareFreedom> when you dont like participate of a discussion for learn something new
[07:54:30] <irelativism> my patience is starting to run out though
[07:54:44] <iShareFreedom> dont use your patience on me dude
[07:55:01] <irelativism> and sadly we missed the opurtunity to grow from each others prepectives
[07:55:23] <iShareFreedom> but your perspective is against my perspective
[07:55:32] <earthling_> language of politics is messy
[07:55:40] <irelativism> no it is not
[07:55:51] <irelativism> prespectives are never against each other
[07:55:53] <earthling_> different meanings of words
[07:56:02] <earthling_> unless you come from same background,education
[07:56:02] <irelativism> just divergence
[07:56:09] <irelativism> is in understanding that divergence that one grows
[07:56:09] <iShareFreedom> but you are pro individual irelativism?
[07:56:17] *** Quits: lockeanarchist (~lockeanar@user/lockeanarchist) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:56:21] <iShareFreedom> or you are pro community?
[07:56:23] <irelativism> that doesnt matter
[07:56:31] <irelativism> given it is unrelated
[07:56:34] <iShareFreedom> but answer my question
[07:56:35] <earthling_> we all see the world uniquely based on your life experience
[07:56:46] <earthling_> have compassion and empathy for others experiences

[07:57:34] <irelativism> that is irelevan for the discussion and will bring bias and assumptions to here ounce again.Im here now to discuss the reason why "open source" was created, even though it is a cancer
[07:58:00] <irelativism> is important to understand it to defeat it ;)
[07:58:06] <irelativism> the reality is so far your position regarding "open source"  is unbased
[07:58:06] <earthling_> open source is a business hype that ignores the philosophy of free software
[07:58:17] <irelativism> and needs further proving iShareFreedom 
[07:58:19] <earthling_> its a profit making tool
[07:58:23] <iShareFreedom> and that is a problem earthling_
[07:58:25] <irelativism> agreed
[07:58:44] <earthling_> that said its a good beginning for windows users
[07:58:55] <iShareFreedom> when opensource born AMD make a free softare driver, but with firmware propietary so that is the example about opensource is defective 
[07:59:01] <leah> "unstable"
[07:59:03] <irelativism> but given sadly we live in a world were that how corporations work we need to find an alternative
[07:59:07] <earthling_> so they get momentum to find more freedom
[07:59:24] <irelativism> yes unstable leah 
[07:59:36] <leah> ...
[07:59:39] <DiffieHellman> "open source" was created because some people were too spineless to talk about freedom.
[07:59:51] <iShareFreedom> that is weak for me
[08:00:06] <labrador> Amdgpu is not unstable lmao
[08:00:12] <iShareFreedom> is like, can speak about the problem but skip it for dont have problems to others
[08:00:15] <DiffieHellman> If a corporation will accept the terms, they can use free software, otherwise we're not intereste.d
[08:00:17] <Andrew> extended support release
[08:00:18] <labrador> Its the best drivers,noone uses radeon anymore
[08:00:25] <irelativism> leah: banning someone for discussion a point in order to understand it, even though not endoursing it, is at minium a unstable action
[08:00:26] <labrador> Except for older gpus
[08:00:34] <labrador> Andrew, what?
[08:00:44] <DiffieHellman> The AMDGPU drivers are free, but they rely on proprietary firmware
[08:00:52] <Andrew> eric s raymond
[08:00:53] <iShareFreedom> that is a trap
[08:00:59] <Andrew> yes, traps
[08:01:03] <iShareFreedom> diffiehellman that is the trap of opensource
[08:01:04] <leah> yeah or i can let you in my channels to act like a self-entitled troll again
[08:01:17] <labrador> No they aren't a trap
[08:01:18] <iShareFreedom> that is the best example what can do perver the meaning of Free Software
[08:01:21] <leah> i choose the alternative: you can badmouth me in #fsf where i don't have to deal with you
[08:01:25] <labrador> They released their drivers
[08:01:27] <leah> good day
[08:01:30] <labrador> Appreicate them
[08:01:30] <iShareFreedom> opensource is a pervertion 
[08:01:34] <labrador> no u
[08:01:34] <DiffieHellman> ^
[08:01:35] <iShareFreedom> of Free Software
[08:01:38] <labrador> hahahaha
[08:02:06] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: do you see with all the nonsense we missed our opurtunity to have a productive converstaion regarding the toic, I suggest you look into ancient greek philosophy to understand why based discourse is so important. :)
[08:02:09] <DiffieHellman> People are always shocked when I tell them I reject "open source" though.
[08:02:26] <leah> irelativism: #libreboot has been a happy, peaceful place since i kickbanned your abusive trolling ass
[08:02:36] <iShareFreedom> i dont like european philosophy irelativism
[08:02:42] <labrador> I like it tho
[08:02:43] <iShareFreedom> for me are completly inmoral
[08:02:46] <labrador> Its socialist
[08:02:49] <labrador> UTOPIA
[08:02:54] <iShareFreedom> completly inmoral for me
[08:02:58] <leah> there has been a general lack of derailing of topics. people stay on point, and things move efficiently. i like it that way
[08:03:04] <labrador> Better than capitalism anyway
[08:03:27] <irelativism> leah: "i choose the alternative: you can badmouth me in #fsf where i don't have to deal with yo" that is ounce again a lie I never "badmouth" you, the reality of the fact is that you were abusive and were unable to correct you action yet
[08:03:33] <iShareFreedom> capitalism for me is a model of trade for trade things with a better price and a better service :)
[08:03:41] <leah> i have a better suggestion for you irelativism: take that giant rod up your ass, and pull it out. you'll walk better and might have a less asinine view of the world
[08:03:51] <DiffieHellman> Idk, but from what I've seen, irelativism supports proprietary software.\
[08:04:03] <iShareFreedom> capitalism = free software becouse you can disitribute for eny propose and with or without price
[08:04:05] <labrador> irelativism, its not ounce,its once
[08:04:06] <leah> you troll #fsf too
[08:04:07] <iShareFreedom> capitalism= propietary sfotware
[08:04:08] <earthling_> capitalism is a hobbesian pessmistic outlook that sees people as selfish greedy
[08:04:10] <labrador> please speak english
[08:04:11] <irelativism> "#libreboot has been a happy, peaceful place since i kickbanned your abusive trolling ass" a note worthy statement from a unstable person
[08:04:12] <leah> every day
[08:04:20] <leah> though
[08:04:27] <leah> this place is full of people like you. this is your home lol
[08:04:28] <labrador> earthling_, yes it makes people assume that everyone is looking to exploit them
[08:04:30] <earthling_> hobbes said life was nasty brutish and short
[08:04:35] <earthling_> thomas
[08:04:35] <irelativism> if you consider this trolling
[08:04:37] <labrador> And will hurt them every chanve they can get
[08:04:43] <labrador> for profit
[08:04:46] <irelativism> then you might be more unstable then I though
[08:04:50] <leah> and the reason for that is because ggoes has the patience of a saint
[08:04:50] <irelativism> thought
[08:05:07] <labrador> Oh yeah ggoes does have a lot of patience
[08:05:18] <irelativism> stop manipulating people leah 
[08:05:25] <leah> you could learn a lot from ggoes, irelativism 
[08:05:29] <irelativism> we have enough of that
[08:05:31] <DiffieHellman> Manipulating who?
[08:05:33] <leah> be like ggoes. calm, thoughtful and patient
[08:05:40] <leah> and learn to respect other people around you
[08:05:43] <iShareFreedom> dude stop sayint to others what they need do irelativism that is so communist and inmoral
[08:05:45] <iShareFreedom> e.e
[08:05:45] <irelativism> you could learn to have the courage to assume your mistakes
[08:05:54] <leah> instead of trying to insert yourself into everything without giving the other person a chance to get a word in edge wise
[08:06:08] <irelativism> I never said I defend communism for the recorf
[08:06:17] <labrador> iShareFreedom, communism is nice
[08:06:19] <labrador> irelativism, ok
[08:06:26] <iShareFreedom> communism is inmoral for me labrador
[08:06:30] <iShareFreedom> is like a suicide for me
[08:06:32] <leah> and idk. do something nice for someone
[08:06:33] <earthling_> we are only human
[08:06:38] <leah> there are two types of people, irelativism 
[08:06:41] <irelativism> "instead of trying to insert yourself into everything without giving the other person a chance to get a word in edge wise" please let the manipulation continue
[08:06:45] <leah> there are those who complain about the worlds problems
[08:06:54] <leah> and those who get off their ass to fix the worlds problems
[08:07:02] <irelativism> if you dont value the truth and logic and consider that trolling
[08:07:03] <leah> you are of the complaining type
[08:07:08] <earthling_> iShareFreedom, what about democratic communism?
[08:07:10] <irelativism> then you are more far gone then I though
[08:07:13] <leah> and you troll irc channels endlessly
[08:07:13] <earthling_> cooperatives
[08:07:14] <irelativism> thought
[08:07:22] <iShareFreedom> that dosent exist earthling_
[08:07:27] <labrador> IT does
[08:07:30] <iShareFreedom> communism always is inmoral
[08:07:31] <irelativism> manipulative leah is on
[08:07:32] <labrador> it can exist
[08:07:33] <iShareFreedom> in eny way
[08:07:33] <earthling_> cooperatives like Mondragon
[08:07:35] <irelativism> be aware
[08:07:39] <earthling_> in Spain
[08:07:46] <iShareFreedom> can, possibility that sound not recommended
[08:07:51] <leah> irelativism: you are literally doing the very thing you accuse me of
[08:07:51] <labrador> iShareFreedom, stop repeating the same things like a parrot
[08:07:55] <labrador> And see for yourself
[08:07:58] <labrador> The truth
[08:08:10] <irelativism> manipulative mode leah is "on", be aware
[08:08:12] <leah> you accuse me of being manipulative. you are clearly aware of one important thing about most human beings: repeat the same thing over and over, and they will believe it
[08:08:22] <iShareFreedom> in spain the young people only want work in the state becouse they are killing the market
[08:08:22] <earthling_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cooperatives
[08:08:34] <DiffieHellman> leah: Yep, irelativism keeps repeating "open source" to try to get me to like it or something.
[08:08:38] <irelativism> sure leah if that makes you feel beter
[08:08:46] <labrador> Open source is needed
[08:08:49] <labrador> DiffieHellman
[08:08:55] <earthling_> Spain doesn't allow workers to be exploited
[08:08:56] <DiffieHellman> Needed for what?
[08:09:03] <earthling_> or tries not to
[08:09:05] <leah> let me remind you why i banned you from #libreboot, irelativism: someone was talking about a known neo-nazi, and i requested that such discussion stop. you responded by continuing to talk about said neo-nazi
[08:09:08] <leah> to be clear:
[08:09:17] <labrador> For promoting free software to companies DiffieHellman 
[08:09:19] <leah> you were banned from #libreboot for promoting the work of a neo-nazi, when i told you not to do that
[08:09:23] <iShareFreedom> opensource is a propietary way for speaking about freedom kickoff the freedom issue.
[08:09:28] <irelativism> that is a lie DiffieHellman I was just trying to explain to you something I consider important unfortunately like iShareFreedom you dont listen
[08:09:28] <labrador> leah, and who is this neo nazi?
[08:09:34] <leah> irelativism: and you act like one too lol
[08:09:48] <labrador> leah, uh maybe don't call others neo nazis
[08:09:49] <leah> you use the same gaslighting tactics they do
[08:09:54] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Free software should be promoted to companies with no hiding of that fact that it's about freedom.
[08:10:05] <irelativism> "let me remind you why i banned you from #libreboot, irelativism: someone was talking about a known neo-nazi, and i requested that such discussion stop. you responded by continuing to talk about said neo-nazi" you are funny, given you had no problem speaking about if for 3 hours
[08:10:06] <leah> while defending "freedom of speech"
[08:10:07] <DiffieHellman> Not mentioning freedom is a peversion.
[08:10:07] <labrador> DiffieHellman, then you are shooting yourself in the foot
[08:10:17] <DiffieHellman> labrador: I live shooting my foot
[08:10:20] <DiffieHellman> *love
[08:10:25] <labrador> Companies couldn't care less about whatever you care about freedom
[08:10:26] <irelativism> but when someone else has a argument to present against you you ban them leah 
[08:10:33] <irelativism> that is abusive behaviour
[08:10:36] <iShareFreedom> for irelativism if you dont believe what he believe you always are wrong, like communist but communist kill you when that happen
[08:10:38] <leah> the truth is, i banned you for being abusive of the community
[08:10:42] <irelativism> and yes I consider you unstable
[08:10:45] <leah> i hope that you become a better person, one day
[08:10:51] <labrador> DiffieHellman, ok then good. I'm gonna go spread open source to companies to benefit free software
[08:10:53] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Then they're not welcome. We'll crush them with our software that has freedom.
[08:10:53] <earthling_> freedom works in a liberal democracy, nazis don't support equal rights
[08:10:59] <labrador> I won't shoot my foot
[08:11:03] <irelativism> manipulatibe leah continues
[08:11:21] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: Sorry, I can't be mainpulated with anything but facts.
[08:11:29] <labrador> irelativism, speak better english first. Half the time I cannot even understand what you mean
[08:11:30] <leah> the very act of repeatedly (and wrongly) calling me manipulative, as a way of silencing my argument, is itself manipulative
[08:11:31] <iShareFreedom> when we speak about freedom to the companies we speak about freedom
[08:11:32] <irelativism> leah: if you would be more concerned about your own mistake instead of the other
[08:11:44] <irelativism> you might be more productive
[08:11:45] <leah> irelativism: again: you were banned from #libreboot for promoting a neo nazi, when i told you specifically not to do that
[08:11:48] <labrador> DiffieHellman, open source is mostly freedom respecting software
[08:11:48] <leah> because
[08:11:51] <leah> neo nazis are evil
[08:12:02] <irelativism>  taht is a lie
[08:12:02] <irelativism> I never promoted
[08:12:09] <labrador> leah, ok. How does this pertain to #fsf tho
[08:12:10] <DiffieHellman> labrador: But it misses the point - and why go mostly when you can go all?
[08:12:12] <irelativism> but sadly you didnt listen to my argumnt
[08:12:14] <earthling_> neo nazis are anti-freedom for minorities
[08:12:27] <klys> cross channel drama is noise
[08:12:28] <leah> if i got cancer in the future if i nazi could cure cancer, i'd choose to die rather than be treated
[08:12:34] <leah> if a*
[08:12:37] <labrador> I feel like both of you are polluting this channel
[08:12:42] <irelativism> earthling_: this are lies dont listen to leah 
[08:12:43] <leah> if i got cancer in the future and if a nazi could cure cancer, i'd choose to die rather than be treated
[08:12:45] <labrador> leah, thank you but i want my life
[08:12:47] <labrador> I'll live
[08:13:03] <irelativism> she was abusive in her power and cannot admit it
[08:13:05] <DiffieHellman> I'll take the treatment off the nazi and release it freedly :3
[08:13:08] <irelativism> that is the reality
[08:13:20] <earthling_> what is the importance of politics to Free Software?
[08:13:23] <irelativism> is also not the first time leah acts abisively in libreboot
[08:13:26] <irelativism> like that
[08:13:31] <leah> irelativism: i didn't abuse my power. i rightly banned you for promoting a neo nazi in my channel, after i said several times for people not to do that, after a discussion about one came up
[08:13:47] <leah> the discussion was about the (admitedly technically excellent) software made by said nazi
[08:13:47] <irelativism> we all remember what happend when libreboot was pulled out of GNUproject
[08:13:51] <leah> but that person was a nazi
[08:13:51] <DiffieHellman> irelativism: Repeating wrong things over and over is not going to convince us sorry.
[08:13:59] <leah> i didn't want him or his work promoted, because nazis are evil
[08:14:01] <labrador> DiffieHellman, because I want the companies' support
[08:14:03] <leah> i said: don't talk about said nazi
[08:14:06] <labrador> Even if it is half assed
[08:14:07] <leah> and you continued talking about him
[08:14:09] <labrador> I want their support
[08:14:09] <irelativism> "you for promoting a neo nazi in my channe" taht is obviously a lie
[08:14:09] <leah> so you were banned
[08:14:12] <labrador> For benefit
[08:14:14] <leah> that was not an abusive ban
[08:14:26] <iShareFreedom> labrador if you share opensource for the companies you go to have companies who dont want freedom to users
[08:14:27] <leah> and me contesting your allegations of abuse is not itself abusive or manipulative
[08:14:27] <DiffieHellman> labrador: I'm not interested in "support" if such support is proprietary software.
[08:14:27] <irelativism> lie is even more manipulative then last time
[08:14:36] <leah> you try to silence my counter argument by accusing my of abuse
[08:14:37] <iShareFreedom> like propietary software labrador
[08:14:38] <Andrew> Can you guys put this in PMs? THanks
[08:14:38] <leah> that itself is abuse
[08:14:44] <leah> please cease this action
[08:14:46] <iShareFreedom> like AMD do 
[08:14:50] <irelativism> not gaving a problem to lie in your own benefit is a dangerous slope leah 
[08:15:06] <klys> earthling_ political science is tangentially related to law via social heritage, marketing, management, and organizations.  except, you would have a difficultt ime wending your way through all that subject matter.
[08:15:10] <leah> your ban in #libreboot is permanent. and btw, you were banned multiple times in the past by swiftgeek, before i took over the project
[08:15:14] <leah> he had the same troubles with you
[08:15:18] <leah> i gave you way more chances than he did
[08:15:22] <labrador> DiffieHellman, I'm fine with companies making open source software(which is software we can use cause its free too) and supporting proprietary software on free OS(like gnu/linux)
[08:15:28] <irelativism> leah: in your sea of lies and manioulation you forgot you wwere the one starting this nonsense :)
[08:15:30] <labrador> That just makes it easier for people to switch
[08:15:30] <Whistler> Andrew: one of them isnt a 'guy' though
[08:15:33] <leah> i actually told swiftgeek off, multiple times, and told him he should give you chances
[08:15:37] <leah> and unbanned you
[08:15:38] <irelativism> I feel sad for you though
[08:15:41] <leah> he threatened to quit when i did that
[08:15:43] <leah> but i did it
[08:15:44] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Well I'm not at all as I don't compromise on freedom,
[08:15:52] <leah> but you abused my good will, time and time again
[08:15:57] <labrador> DiffieHellman, you need to compromise for benefit
[08:15:57] <leah> and now you accuse me of abuse
[08:16:00] <labrador> And I can do that
[08:16:01] <leah> it's unfair
[08:16:01] <irelativism> I dont care about your changes
[08:16:03] <leah> and you should stop
[08:16:06] <irelativism> the world doesnt surround arround you leah 
[08:16:09] <labrador> Not compromising extincts yourself

[08:29:50] <irelativism> so I will repeat so there is clarity.
[08:29:50] <irelativism> vitali64 has a button on his website about landchad.net(a creation of luck smith). after sharing his new website in #libreboot. Leah and others spent 3 hours dogshiting on everything luke smith created because they dont agree with his ideals. I also indeed dont agree with his ideals, but when checking the backlog I notice that nonsense saying evrything one does is worthless because of such ideology, which obviously sparked a refutation from my
[08:29:50] <irelativism> behalf given that is obviously ilogical and landchat is a actual decent service, true it uses a sad name nontheless a usefull page. All of the sudden leah claims this conversation is off topic, disclaimer: leah spent hours talking about it before someone(me) call out her bullshit, 10 seconds later I got banned. Conclusion lie has no problem manipulating and liying about what happend in #libreboot, and has abcously taken a abusive action, this
[08:29:50] <irelativism> is also not the first time he does such things, that was the reason libreboot was kicked  out of the GNU project. I font have anything against leah but until this is corrected and the lies stop and a apology would be helpfull. I will not allow this manipulation to happend
[08:30:26] <labrador> iShareFreedom, hahhhaa
[08:30:31] <labrador> Fascism is socialism

[08:43:02] <labrador> leah luke smith != neo nazi
[08:43:09] <Andrew> DEFINE neo-nazi
[08:43:51] <klys> someone who celebrates 4/20
[08:44:00] <irelativism> leah: was abusive and doesnt want to admit it, so lies about what I said and did and continues to be manipulative in #fsf:libera.chat 
[08:44:07] <irelativism> my test aboves explains everything
[08:44:11] <Whistler> that website mixes references of a incel slang into something appearantly helpful, and it's a bad thing
[08:44:17] <irelativism> if you dont beleieve me just check logs
[08:44:21] <labrador> uhh klys 420 seems to me the funny weed number
[08:44:22] <labrador> so idk
[08:44:30] <Whistler> maybe someone should fork it 
[08:44:30] <irelativism> Whistler: indeed
[08:44:31] <labrador> Lets celebrate!
[08:44:34] <Andrew> Whistler: That's true, I'll fork it :D
[08:44:35] <leah> irelativism: specifically, when i say what you did wrong, you start mouthing off the same thing: you accuse me of manipulation. you're relying on the fact that if you make the irc backlog scroll up faster, what i said will be drowned out. also, you know that people will grow tired of this conversation, and not see any of it
[08:44:38] <klys> labrador, it's a.hitler's bday
[08:44:41] <labrador> Whistler, its not 'incel slang'
[08:44:42] <irelativism> that was not the discussion Whistler though
[08:44:44] <labrador> klys, oh
[08:44:45] <labrador> uh
[08:44:50] <labrador> I didn't know
[08:44:53] <labrador> now I know
[08:44:53] <Andrew> And I'll use a FSF-like css on it
[08:44:58] <irelativism> is not mothing off is the reality
[08:45:01] <irelativism> leah: 
[08:45:06] <leah> so i'll say it again, for good measure: you were banned from #libreboot for promoting a neo nazi in #libreboot (and in general you were a troll in that channel, derailing conversations almost daily)
[08:45:16] <irelativism> you cant accept what you did then taht is a diferent history
[08:45:22] <labrador> Luke smith isnt a neo nazi leah
[08:45:29] <labrador> On the other hand you can ban anyone
[08:45:36] <labrador> Over anything
[08:45:40] <irelativism> "promoting a neo-nazi" irelativism laghs
[08:46:03] <leah> as for luke smith being a neo nazi, want me to demonstrate? really?
[08:46:07] <irelativism> what actully happend without leah lies and manipulation""so I will repeat so there is clarity.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/f78b15b1a1314458140a1f1c4d150e6fa283688a)
[08:46:10] <labrador> yeah sure leah
[08:46:13] <labrador> Coeme on
[08:46:15] <labrador> I wanna see
[08:46:18] <Andrew> I don't think linking to one of his websites that helps people while also mixing with incel slang is promoting neo-nazism
[08:46:24] <leah> https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/contact
[08:46:31] <leah> look at those dancing frogs on contact page lol
[08:46:37] <leah> it's a hate symbol
[08:46:39] <labrador> leah, those are pepes
[08:46:42] <labrador> its a nice meme
[08:46:43] <leah> it's called pepe the frog
[08:46:46] <labrador> I know
[08:46:46] <DiffieHellman> Pepe isn't a hate symbol though?
[08:46:49] <labrador> I like pepe
[08:46:49] <leah> nazis use it to signal that they are nazis
[08:46:51] <labrador> Its cute
[08:46:59] <labrador> leah, again you're going a little delusional
[08:47:00] <labrador> Its a meme
[08:47:04] <labrador> A normal meme
[08:47:10] <labrador> Anybody can use it
[08:47:19] <leah> here's a guardian article that talks about neo nazis. luke smith is in it:
[08:47:19] <DiffieHellman> I can confirm that pepe's are a normal meme that neo-nazi's like to use too.
[08:47:20] <leah> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:47:24] <Andrew> leah: If I rickroll people on my website, does that make me a Nazi, or something else political?  What makes pepe different?
[08:47:30] <labrador> Andrew, nothing
[08:47:31] <DiffieHellman> Unless it's got a german hat, it's not neo-nazi though
[08:47:32] <labrador> Its a meme
[08:47:36] <labrador> Like all ememes
[08:47:45] <labrador> leah, kek
[08:47:54] <leah> i'm going to spam that link several times so that irelativism can't drown it out by abusively and manipulatively calling me an abusive manipulator, which i am not

[08:48:15] <leah> reasons why luke smith is a nazi: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:48:15] <labrador> leah, guardian cannot spew out bullshit over internet culture
[08:48:17] <DiffieHellman> leah: Please cease spamming
[08:48:17] <leah> reasons why luke smith is a nazi: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:48:17] <labrador> Like this
[08:48:19] <leah> reasons why luke smith is a nazi: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:48:19] <irelativism> Andrew: what is even more funny is that I never linked the website, and also said his ideology is problematic, I just pointed out leahs bullshit, and because leah didnt like it she banned me, no wonder one can defy leah ultimate authority :):)
[08:48:20] <labrador> Its wrong
[08:48:21] <leah> reasons why luke smith is a nazi: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:48:33] <labrador> Nope
[08:48:34] <Whistler> well, dog whistles are intended so that common people cannot understand that :( one of the example, 'all life matters'
[08:48:41] <Andrew> leah: Ugh...
[08:48:46] <Andrew> That's too many
[08:48:49] <leah> > A Guardian investigation can now reveal that one of the lesser-known beneficiaries is a YouTube influencer of sorts – one with a history of promoting far-right political ideology. Luke Smith, now a Florida resident, maintains a monetized YouTube channel with 109,000 subscribers. He received at least one bitcoin from Bachelier, valued at the time of writing at just over $30,000.
[08:48:50] <irelativism> Andrew:  what is even more funny is that I never linked the website, and also said his ideology is problematic, I just pointed out leahs bullshit, and because leah didnt like it she banned me, no wonder one can defy leah ultimate authority :):)
[08:48:53] <DiffieHellman> leah: Luke Smith isn't a nazi unless all "open source" supporters are Nazi's.
[08:48:57] <leah> > It’s possible that Bachelier saw in Luke Smith a like mind and a shared purpose. Beyond their common ground in far-right politics, each saw technology as a weapon in their war against liberal, tolerant societies.
[08:49:00] <klys> leah do you want folks to read that article?
[08:49:00] <Andrew> irelativism: Okay
[08:49:16] <labrador> Leah pepes don't make you a neo nazi
[08:49:26] <labrador> Its a meme spammed almost everywhere
[08:49:40] * Andrew can't get to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship because it is censored here, can anyone paste the html on some pastebin e.g. 0x0?
[08:49:40] <DiffieHellman> Some weird neo-nazi donated to Luke Smith, but I don't see what that means/
[08:50:10] <irelativism> leahs action was abusive and athoritarian, this also already happend in the past and was because of this that libreboot got kicked out of the GNU project
[08:50:12] <labrador> Andrew, bad luck ig. Try using tor
[08:50:28] <damo22> here's a crazy idea: dont get involved in projects where the person running it is more interested in their ego than the project itself
[08:50:41] <irelativism> agreed
[08:50:45] <irelativism> damo22: 
[08:50:46] <labrador> damo22, good idea
[08:50:51] <irelativism> I learn my lesson
[08:51:04] <Andrew> damo22, I'd only fork it and do that when the project itself gets spooky
[08:51:07] <labrador> leah maybe a self assesment would be beneficial
[08:51:21] <irelativism> I still green on the free/libre software world
[08:51:31] <labrador> Andrew, spooky here means tripping on the glowie alarms
[08:51:33] <labrador> hehe
[08:51:45] <klys> is feeding the trolls an occupational hazard we face with managed risk and advocacy?
[08:52:04] <Andrew> 03Ahhhhh.00
[08:52:12] <DiffieHellman> This guardian article is full of spaghetii
[08:52:18] <labrador> i know DiffieHellman 
[08:52:22] * Andrew goes back working on forking Landchad.net
[08:52:22] <DiffieHellman> The writer is just making things up.
[08:52:34] <irelativism> I nontheless havent anything against leah just wish the lies and manipulation about my person stop and if possible an apology for such abusive action
[08:52:38] <labrador> Its guardian bullshit,anything about internet culture by journlaists is wrong
[08:52:40] <leah> luke smith also talks regularly about being "red pilled" and "based"
[08:52:48] <labrador> leah, yes based is a meme too
[08:52:49] <leah> more nazi rhetoric
[08:52:50] <DiffieHellman> leah: I'm basnd though?
[08:52:53] <labrador> Like b-b-based
[08:53:05] <labrador> He's just a cringe memer
[08:53:35] <irelativism> the issue here leah is that I never defended him I just said not everithyng he does is bad, just because of his ideology
[08:53:53] <iShareFreedom> but nazi rethoric is the socialism rethoric
[08:54:00] <Andrew> leah: What memes/other things would count as Nazi stuff?  How do you get the information that Nazis use these things to signal other neo-nazis?
[08:54:04] <iShareFreedom> becouse nazi is national socialism
[08:54:05] <klys> a meme is short for mnemonic or memory device, an article of communication that caries meaning.
[08:54:24] <labrador> Andrew, through his delusions
[08:54:32] <irelativism> what is problematic is that you spent 3 hours speaking about it, that day, but when someone presents a disputing argument you say it is offtopic and nazi and ban
[08:54:42] * Andrew 03does not understand
[08:55:01] <irelativism> for leah ^^
[08:55:11] <irelativism> again the issue here leah is that I never defended him I just said not everithyng he does is bad, just because of his ideology
[08:55:13] <Andrew> 03I mean I don't understand the delusions stuff
[08:55:14] <labrador> You need to have better english Andrew,understanding innuendos is harder than straight english
[08:55:31] <Andrew> labrador: I know, I'm not native
[08:55:39] <irelativism> labrador: not everyone is native english speaker
[08:55:44] <irelativism> dont be snobish
[08:55:45] <Whistler> irelativism: do note that alt-right people pretty hate transgender people, but not people like you.
[08:56:06] <irelativism> Whistler: I know and Iacknowlege that 
[08:56:14] <irelativism> on the discussion that day
[08:56:30] <labrador> Andrew, or you'll be that guy on ltt that told a girl 'I want you to screw!' while handing her a screw driver
[08:56:33] <labrador> That was very funny
[08:56:37] <labrador> He was chinese too
[08:56:39] <labrador> i think
[08:56:40] <irelativism> but saying that everything he does is dogshit and should never be used is obviously nonsense
[08:56:52] <Andrew> 02?
[08:57:02] <labrador> ok ok I'll stop
[08:57:09] <leah> https://www.reddit.com/r/lukesmith/comments/hqm5v5/luke_smith_is_officially_a_white_supremacist/
[08:57:16] <Andrew> Cloning landchad, 9 kiB/s
[08:57:29] <labrador> leah, thats a reddit post
[08:57:34] <DiffieHellman> leah: Why are you linking to nonfree JavaScript?
[08:57:37] <labrador> THats what your sources are huh
[08:57:39] <labrador> hehehe
[08:57:40] <irelativism> eheh what a fucking mess
[08:57:57] <klys> leah did your mom marry a white dude?  if so I'd say she's a white supremacist.  otoh. I am not a white supremacist.
[08:58:01] <irelativism> sad the movement has come to this
[08:58:04] <irelativism> Whistler:  I know and Iacknowlege that
[08:58:04] <irelativism> on the discussion that day, but saying that everything he does is dogshit and should never be used is obviously nonsense
[08:58:16] * irelativism goes work on replicant
[08:58:35] * Andrew tries to clone the Git repo
[08:59:27] <leah> i mean
[08:59:29] <leah> look
[08:59:32] <leah> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[08:59:34] <leah> if you can read that
[08:59:40] <leah> and still think luke smith isn't a nazi
[08:59:49] <leah> then you're either lost
[08:59:50] <leah> or a nazi
[08:59:52] <leah> :P
[08:59:56] <klys> is l.smith mentioned in the article?
[09:00:03] <DiffieHellman> leah: He's not one though?
[09:00:23] <DiffieHellman> The article just makes things up. I see one point; Luke Smitch recieved one bitcoin from a weird guy
[09:00:45] <iShareFreedom> what is a nazi?
[09:00:54] <leah> come on
[09:00:55] <labrador> leah, he isnt a nazi
[09:00:57] <leah> do the math
[09:01:00] <iShareFreedom> isnt a nacionalist/socialist?
[09:01:01] <klys> if you want to understand the truth behind accusations, you should get your info from the horse's mouth.
[09:01:03] <labrador> And the guardian cannot report well on meming
[09:01:05] <Andrew> \neg \left(nazis pay me \Rightarrow I am a nazi\right)
[09:01:07] <leah> why do you think a fascist would donate money to someone
[09:01:11] <Andrew> \begin{definition}{nazi}
[09:01:14] <leah> like
[09:01:15] <iShareFreedom> what is facist?
[09:01:16] <Andrew> Type your defintion here, leah
[09:01:28] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:01:31] <iShareFreedom> facist is who be part of nationalism socialism?
[09:01:31] <leah> oh, you want me to define fascism?
[09:01:35] <DiffieHellman> leah: Since he enjoyed his videos for whatever reason and had lots of bitcoin to burn before sudoku?
[09:01:37] <labrador> Yeah I feel like his definition is wider than normal 
[09:01:39] <iShareFreedom> your definition of facism
[09:01:43] <iShareFreedom> yes
[09:01:44] <klys> the official source for english definitions is https://www.m-w.com/
[09:01:45] <Andrew> labrador: 
[09:01:47] <Andrew> "His"
[09:01:55] <labrador> Like leah includes stuff that isn't actually fascism
[09:01:59] <labrador> Andrew, uh?
[09:02:01] <leah> it's an extreme system of government characterized by dictatorship, with hatred of minories (race based politics. they often beat on queers too)
[09:02:13] <leah> it's like. when capitalism fails, fascism happens
[09:02:13] <Andrew> \end{definition}
[09:02:20] <leah> when the system tries to reclaim itself
[09:02:34] <leah> it usually happens after some economic crisis and someone comes in promising to fix everything
[09:02:46] <leah> but then they are just a dictator
[09:02:54] <leah> trump for instance is a fascist
[09:02:55] <labrador> Andrew, his here meant leah not luke smith
[09:03:04] <labrador> That was ambiguous
[09:03:05] <iShareFreedom> im capitalist
[09:03:12] <Andrew> Oh
[09:03:14] <leah> who btw people like smith are actively supporting
[09:03:30] <Andrew> leah: How do you know?
[09:03:34] <leah> what
[09:03:39] <labrador> leah, no I never even heard a word about fascism and nazis from him
[09:03:39] <leah> what do you mean
[09:03:41] <labrador> So no
[09:03:49] <labrador> He just rants about tech
[09:03:50] <iShareFreedom> but nazi are socialism
[09:03:51] <labrador> Thats it
[09:03:53] <iShareFreedom> not capitalism
[09:03:54] <leah> labrador: yeah fascists/nazis never use the word fascist/nazi
[09:03:55] <labrador> iShareFreedom, you're wrong
[09:04:00] <leah> labrador: fascists always deny being fascist
[09:04:08] <klys> if you want to understand the truth behind accusations, you should get your info from the horse's mouth.
[09:04:14] <leah> it's like a pedo denying being a complete degenerate pedo
[09:04:17] <iShareFreedom> remmeber nazi mean: National and socialism german people
[09:04:18] <leah> it's in their blood to deny
[09:04:25] <leah> because they know they'll be lynched
[09:04:30] <leah> and rightly so
[09:04:33] <labrador> kek
[09:04:33] <leah> these people are evil
[09:04:43] <leah> >kek
[09:04:53] <klys> german for cookie
[09:04:57] <labrador> Well they are,but luke smith is not one of them
[09:05:09] <leah> if you want to believe that, so be it
[09:05:13] <leah> but i'm telling you, he is
[09:05:19] <labrador> the trollolol wakes up in me when you talk leah
[09:05:21] <labrador> idk why
[09:05:27] <leah> and irelativism was banned from my channel for promoting him
[09:05:34] <leah> and now, instead of accepting what happened like a normal person
[09:05:36] <Andrew> leah: curl https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io
[09:05:38] <Andrew> Thank you
[09:05:40] <leah> and maybe idk, apologizing to me, and being nice
[09:05:44] <klys> and why do you choose to discriminate against others for their political orientation?
[09:05:46] <labrador> Andrew, USE TOR
[09:05:47] <leah> he badmouths me almost daily in #fsf
[09:05:55] <iShareFreedom> nationalist and socialist are evil
[09:05:56] <Andrew> labrador: All bridges I try are blocked
[09:05:56] <leah> of course, it's perfectly ok for *him* to say stuff about me
[09:06:04] <leah> as soon as i defend myself, i'm accused of being manipulative
[09:06:13] <leah> for enforcing the rules i laid down in my own community
[09:06:17] <Whistler> tor hasn't been usable in china at least since 10 years ago
[09:06:19] <labrador> Andrew, ugh well you should go to #tor again. Tor is the only way to freedom for the chinese
[09:06:31] <labrador> Whistler, snowflake?
[09:06:35] <labrador> That should work
[09:06:41] <labrador> We can still help Andrew 
[09:06:50] <Andrew> labrador: Please, later.
[09:07:29] <leah> and btw, i have real work to do. but i can't let someone badmouth me in #fsf
[09:07:38] <leah> irelativism wastes hours of my time
[09:07:42] <leah> i want it to stop
[09:07:53] <labrador> leah, noone cares about what others think
[09:08:02] <labrador> I do not actually think of you like....ever
[09:08:07] <leah> he clearly knows i'm not unbanning him. so his purpose here isn't to oppose his ban
[09:08:07] <labrador> So you can go and work
[09:08:10] <klys> directquote from satan: 22:29:13< leah> these people are evil
[09:08:12] <leah> his purpose is to punish me
[09:08:39] <labrador> And you're fanning that fire
[09:08:47] <labrador> irelativism really did nothing wrong
[09:08:49] <DiffieHellman> leah: Can't you /ignore?
[09:08:57] <leah> i could, but it would continue
[09:09:02] <leah> irelativism is obsessed with me
[09:09:17] <leah> he is virtually cyberstalking at this point
[09:09:17] <DiffieHellman> leah: So let him keep trolling with messages that you can't see
[09:09:19] <leah> and i want it to stop
[09:09:25] <klys> yes, I suspect that it will continue.  you fed the troll.  who will clean it up?
[09:09:38] <labrador> leah, cyberstalking lmao
[09:09:44] <labrador> Where do you get words like these?
[09:09:50] <labrador> These big big words
[09:09:59] <iShareFreedom> just block it leah
[09:10:03] <labrador> Do not mean what you think they do
[09:10:07] <iShareFreedom> if you want be cyberstalking dont block him
[09:10:26] <Andrew> leah: /ignore irelativism 
[09:10:36] <leah> i really should just do that
[09:11:07] <leah> i'm really upset by what irelativism has been doing. it's not fair
[09:11:18] <labrador> that would get rid of the shitfest here
[09:11:23] <labrador> So good solution Andrew 
[09:12:34] <irelativism> "and irelativism was banned from my channel for promoting him" I never promoted him this is another lie
[09:12:55] <Andrew> You said that many times.
[09:13:01] <labrador> yeah leah you're a little overreacting
[09:13:03] <irelativism> "irelativism
[09:13:04] <irelativism> is obsessed with me" dont let your self be manipulated
[09:13:15] <Andrew> My first command after cloning Landchad: grep -ri 'linux' .
[09:13:21] <irelativism> "irelativism
[09:13:21] <irelativism> really did nothing wrong" you did
[09:13:35] <irelativism> but you dont want to admit it so you bulshit people like this
[09:14:04] <leah> i've reported irelativism to ggoes
[09:14:08] <leah> this has to stop
[09:14:19] <irelativism> fortunately I have a relentless determination, and I will not let you do this by atacking my personality like you did with other in the past
[09:14:21] <leah> i hope something is done about the abuse i've been getting from him

[09:15:02] <irelativism> "i'm really upset by what irelativism has been doing. it's not fair" another lie I havent done anything this discussion are almost allways started by leah not me disclaimer
[09:15:05] <klys> breathe your name - sixpence none the richer
[09:15:11] <irelativism> be aware of leah manipulation
[09:15:40] <irelativism> "i've reported irelativism to ggoes" great ggoes will realise the lies you have been telling

[15:11:45] <zleap> how are things
[15:11:53] <Andrew> How good of an idea would it be to add an RSS feed to my site that updates every git commit?
[15:11:54] *** Quits: KUrare_ (~KUrare@user/kurare) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:12:24] <Andrew> It seems that I need RSS to let people know a bit about updates, but I don't post blogs or anything like that, we revise and update pages...
[15:12:24] <zleap> would be good, i could subscribe via mastodon
[15:12:33] <zleap> unless you can add activity pub support
[15:12:55] <Andrew> I don't really like social media of any kind...
[15:13:14] <Andrew> And I'd argue that ActivityPub is multi-centered, not decentralized
[15:13:15] <zleap> it would more help those who use it, nut I understand your point
[15:13:42] <zleap> it is mroe the glue that helps various services such as peertube, mastodon etc to talk

[15:14:15] <zleap> not sure
[15:14:23] <Andrew> Maybe like send a mastedon post every commit? that's a bit lame lol
[15:14:45] <Andrew> Or a mailing list for every commit
[15:14:54] <zleap> i would just subscribe to the post, once it gets on to mastodon I could manuallyh boost stuff
[15:15:06] <Andrew> Hmm
[15:15:07] <zleap> does git support rss
[15:15:16] <Andrew> zleap: I can write a simple script to do so

[19:16:15] <buddhilw> Well, I like to think of median as a non-biased mean, regarding ourliers
[19:16:40] <buddhilw> if meadian -> mean, then there is not many significant outliers in the dataset
[19:16:59] <kompowiec> yeah, if you calculated it in average form, instant messaging like AOL or yahoo would change your score
[19:17:14] <labrador> buddhilw, yeah its not biased in that way. Like if 90% of people are dirt poor and 10% are filthy rich. Mean says everything is fine while median shows the reality

[20:06:30] <zleap> this is a pretty standard method of doing that,  i just need to figure out how to attach the sheet to something
[20:06:36] <Andrew> you might as well try that with a quantum computer (jk)
[20:06:56] <zleap> i want to demo at a STEM group I am involved in
[20:07:01] <Andrew> The ROCK64 *obviously* has a HDMI port
[20:07:13] <zleap> so put weight in middle and observe how small metal balls move around the mass
[20:07:18] <zleap> Andrew, thought so
[20:07:25] <Andrew> zleap: Look at the image lol
[20:07:31] <kompowiec> maybe you would have to start with what ease of use is and how to define it. Without it, still only commercial open source software will be "easy"
[20:07:50] <Andrew> zleap: If you want a SBC, I recommend beaglebone blacks

[20:11:12] <Kaiod> Kaiod: My government email credentials just arrived in my email, but I thought it would be a free system, but they paid for the Office 365 license and my email will be Outlook.
[20:11:15] <Andrew> Arduino Yun can run "Linux"
[20:11:24] <zleap> ok
[20:11:44] <Andrew>  The Arduino Yún is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4 and the Atheros AR9331. The Atheros processor supports a Linux distribution based on OpenWrt named Linino OS. The board has built-in Ethernet and WiFi support, a USB-A port, micro-SD card slot, 20 digital input/output pins (7 of them can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB
[20:11:46] <Andrew> connection, an ICSP header, and 3 reset buttons. 
[20:11:48] <Kaiod> Kaiod: Is there any solution that can make this more free? Even with the Outlook issue?

[21:58:28] <jacobk> Modern Element sometimes loads nonfree reCAPTCHA, but it does this by downloading code from Google and loading it IIRC, so I don't think proprietary code is necessary in Element to support loading reCAPTCHA. That would mean it's easy to block using NoScript or LibreJS, but it's still probably best not to recommend Element in that case, right?
[21:59:47] <kompowiec> or recommended kosher instances like midov.pl

[22:01:26] <David_Hedlund> jacobk: We only approve free software so Element must remove proprietary code even if it's easy to circumvent the use of it.

[22:02:02] <craigt> djatropine: Hello! Welcome to this week's Free Software Directory meeting.
[22:02:18] <kompowiec> but midov is good freetard (idk neutral term, sorry) and he burns fire to any non-free garbage
[22:03:35] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[22:03:48] <jacobk> David_Hedlund: It's served from a different domain. Currently it only works with reCAPTCHA, but there are plans to make it more neutural, to allow for servers to send a link to arbitrary code and run it (I could be misunderstanding, though), so eventually it will be more like web browsers that support JavaScript without LibreJS built-in.
[22:04:55] <jacobk> "The goal is to find a way to support arbitrary captcha" - "turt2live" at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1281
[22:05:14] <ewwegweg_> But Element need read code. Matrix constantly adds new features.

[22:19:41] <jacobk> Element desktop depends on Electron (nonfree(?)) and I guess you can't install extensions like a normal browser, in order to block the nonfree scripts loaded dynamically.
[22:21:29] <jacobk> Really the problem is that code is downloaded and run without the user understanding this, but, we let web browsers get away with it, mostly.
