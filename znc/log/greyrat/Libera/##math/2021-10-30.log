[00:00:08] <greenbagels> jargon: so |x1-x2|/2 and |y1-y2|/2 define two half-axes lengths
[00:00:18] <greenbagels> depending on which is larger and smaller these are called the semimajor and semiminor axis lengths
[00:00:30] <greenbagels> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse#Parameters
[00:00:56] <greenbagels> you can search this page to find "area" to find what you want
[00:01:07] <greenbagels> that green region you colored is just teh area of the large ellipse minus the area of the small ellipse
[00:01:12] <greenbagels> but you use teh same techniques to find both
[00:01:14] <mawk> if the magic things are not integer then we can simply take ln(kth prime)
[00:01:16] <dude12312414> mawk: technically prime factorizations only work for finite sequences, though, so you're always bounded
[00:01:18] <mawk> but that feels like cheating
[00:01:30] <mawk> indeed dude12312414

[00:14:05] <mawk> yes that's what I meant
[00:14:09] <mawk> sorry
[00:15:17] <jargon> Are "a" and "b" the major and minor?
[00:15:38] <mawk> I'm not sure which, but I think yes
[00:16:14] <mawk> the bigger one is the semimajor and the smaller one is the semi-minor axis
[00:16:17] <mawk> supposedly
[00:16:28] <mawk> and if you swap them then that's like rotating the ellipse 90°
[00:16:39] <jargon> and "r²"?
[00:16:48] <mawk> that's the radius squared
[00:16:48] <biberao> if the image is correct
[00:16:54] <biberao> the a should be x
[00:16:56] <biberao> right
[00:17:03] <mawk> maybe write it R to emphasize it's constant
[00:17:12] <mawk> although a and b are lowercase so I don't know how you're supposed to write
[00:17:15] <jargon> Where does the radius come from since it's an ellipse?
[00:17:33] <mawk> actually I think there's no r in the equation, just 1
[00:18:46] <mawk> it doesn't really matter, it's still an ellipse with an R there; it's just not how you usually write it

I have a problem to find a binary one dimensional vector v_f (e.g. a std::bitset<256>) and I try to define a tree-like structure of find the "nearest" vector v_n. As the size of any |vector| == 256 I can't create any node/edge in a tree. Is there a clever way to find a binary vector with size 256 via a tree structure?

[02:52:22] <PlanckWalk> Oh, then pretty easy
[02:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> i use pythagoras to compute the lengths
[02:52:42] <PlanckWalk> You don't even need pythagoras to get the point you want
[02:52:43] <[itchyjunk]> i can kinda tell on which line segment i should be in

[02:52:53] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[02:52:56] <PlanckWalk> (Once you know the line segment)
[02:53:03] <PlanckWalk> It's just linear interpolation
[02:53:42] <PlanckWalk> px = (1-t) x1 + t x2
[02:53:50] <PlanckWalk> Where t is your input parameter
[02:53:57] <[itchyjunk]> i need to know each path length and substract that with where i want to be to figure out which sigment i need to be on first, no?
[02:54:08] <PlanckWalk> Yes, but you said you had that already
[02:54:18] <[itchyjunk]> almost, but i can probably figure that out
[02:54:42] <[itchyjunk]> so say i am on some segment of length l and i wanna be p% along that
[02:54:51] <[itchyjunk]> so px is just that thing you say?
[02:54:53] <[itchyjunk]> hmm

[02:55:32] <PlanckWalk> You could write it as  x1 + t (x2-x1)  if you prefer

[02:55:43] <[itchyjunk]> hmm my t was for the entire path, i guess i need to compute t for current segment
[02:55:46] <Decker> of the 0-1 t for the whole loop
[02:56:42] <[itchyjunk]> Decker, meaning i need to compute what percent of path traversal is left for that segment as a value between [0,1] ? if so, makes sense

[03:03:38] <PlanckWalk> If a path can have many segments and not change often (or at all), you can cache segment lengths for fast lookup.
[03:03:46] <PlanckWalk> But that may be a premature optimization.
[03:04:17] <Decker> it's not a bit hit for space ... and does simplify things a bit to have that cache
[03:04:25] <Decker> (bit=big)
[03:09:58] <[itchyjunk]> you can actually lose points for premature optimization for this class :s so i'll just do it for now and see how it goes

[05:34:09] <isekaijin> Isn't linear algebra literally the easiest part of math? Not only do you get the most theorems from the fewest assumptions, but also the proofs are incomparably easy compared to what you see in analysis or the rest of abstract algebra.

[05:36:11] <Cale> Well, it's still possible to get things wrong when you don't have a grand perspective on everything yet, and I think linear algebra can, for real, be quite subtle. Not every askable question about linear algebra is trivial.
[05:38:19] <Cale> If you have n disjoint bases for a finite dimensional vector space V, is it possible to arrange them into a matrix such that the rows of the matrix are exactly the given bases, and the columns of the matrix are also bases?
[05:39:39] <Cale> (this is an open problem, called Rota's basis conjecture)
[05:42:19] <Cale> I think anyone who thinks linear algebra is trivial would be well served by Roman's book "Advanced Linear Algebra", which covers most things in what I'd consider to be the "uncompromisingly right/modern" way, while introducing a lot of interesting surrounding material.
[05:43:09] <cherim> Rota's basis conjecture is more combinatorial in nature than linear-algebraic
[05:43:24] <Cale> Well, sure, kind of.
[05:44:19] <Galois> published in 1994 .. ??? ... ???
[05:44:26] <Galois> the year Rota taught me linear algebra
[05:44:37] <cherim> It's even more natural in matroid setting, and the freedom of "a set of permutations, one per row" is easy to produce a combinatorially hard question

[05:44:56] <cherim> Since already Latin squares are hard
[05:45:41] <qergle> isn't it common to confuse statements with their converses or to think statements are iff when they're not?
[05:46:54] <isekaijin> No idea, but linear algebra is quite literally the best place in undergraduate mathematics to give a long list of statements, and say that A iff B iff C iff D iff...
[05:47:18] <cherim> In a uniformly random large Latin square with first row 1,2,...n, how is the second row asymptotically distributed?
[05:47:19] <qergle> got confused by similar ⇒ same charpoly. i would not be surprised to find wrong answers on test.
[05:47:25] <qergle> otherwise all tests would be 100%
[05:47:38] <Cale> qergle: Outside of mathematics, I would say a large fraction of the problems in the world can be boiled down to this at their essence.
[05:48:01] <cherim> I think this is also open (with "uniform on derangements" an almost-certain answer)
[05:48:16] <cherim> But not enough techniques
[05:49:27] <PlanckWalk> I was thinking that it had to be for a moment, then realized the mistake I was making.
[05:49:56] <Cale> cherim: But yeah, part of my point I guess is that matroids are a structure that is at some sense at the heart of at least a lot of linear algebra, but which usually don't get introduced at that point in people's mathematical development. So all the tough questions one can ask about matroids aren't something that's considered necessarily connected to linear algebra.
[05:52:12] <Galois> matroids are to linear algebra what topology is to real analysis
[05:53:35] <cherim> We can resurrect "If A and B are linear operators on C^n  and rank [A, B]=1, then A and B have a common eigenvector" which is 100% linear-algebraic and check how long it takes isekaijin to prove
[05:53:39] <qergle> Cale: there are probably a great number of world problems that take that form.

[06:34:21] <isekaijin> cherim: Sorry, I was busy grading more tests, but here it goes. [A, B] has a nonzero row. By rearranging the coordinates of C^n, we may assume that it is the top row. The other rows of [A, B] are multiples of the top row, so there exists an invertible matrix P such that P [A, B] is zero below the top row. Then PAP^{-1} and PBP^{-1} are also zero below the top row. In particular, they are upper
[06:34:24] <isekaijin> triangular, so e_1 is a common eigenvector of both. Undo the change of basis P to find the common eigenvector of A and B.

[09:02:44] <rubiksdream> https://imgur.com/a/EEXuS07 , does anyone know how to formalize this? specifically, the blue line is some unimodal function that is smooth on [-2pin - pi/2, 2pin + pi/2] besides say at its endpoints, the black line is 2max(0,cost). I want to show that for every blue line, there is always a redline closer to the black line at every point. I want the redline to always cover one full positive hump of 2max(cost,0) and the rest should
[09:02:45] <rubiksdream> be horizontal pieces of length 2pi.
[09:02:56] <rubiksdream> by unimodal, I mean strictly increasing up to some maximum, and then strictly decreasing
[09:03:05] <rubiksdream> it feels very intuitive, but i dont know how to formalize this
[09:03:37] <rubiksdream> the screenshot was taken from the answer to https://mathoverflow.net/questions/64099/the-maximum-of-a-polynomial-on-the-unit-circle/103918#103918, but i dont think reading that entire answer is necessary for my question

[13:03:30] <joel135> except: T is called a (finite) set because it can have automorphisms, which numbers can't
[13:03:49] <riv> but can it? everything is a map so that seems difficult. but maybe it's  possible through ramification points
[13:04:43] <joel135> consider the double covering of a circle by itself (basically the same example as z^2 : P^1 -> P^1, by the way, i think)
[13:04:58] <riv> nice example
[13:05:48] <joel135> the fibers are T = {0, 1}, and the map z |-> -z in the domain makes the automorphism {0, 1} <-> {1, 0}
[13:05:49] <riv> I suppose that although everything is a topological map, the assignment from p |--> (U_p, T) is actually just a function with no conditions

[13:06:21] <riv> joel135: ah that is really neat ty
[13:06:37] <riv> im already seeing the connection
[13:10:05] <joel135> this covering can also be described as a presheaf. namely, let C = {⟳.} be the category generated by a single object and a single loop, and let X : C(^op) -> Set send the object '.' to {0, 1} and the morphism '⟳' to the function that swaps 0 and 1.
[13:12:19] <riv> you said presheaf to scare me but then described something totally understandable
[13:12:26] <joel135> :)
[13:12:49] <joel135> C is the 'base circle', codomain of z |-> z^2 above, and X is the domain of z |-> z^2 represented as its collection of fibers over C.
[13:13:06] <riv> why is this C(^op) rather than C?
[13:13:40] <riv> maybe it doesn't matter actually?
[13:13:55] <joel135> i wrote (^op) as to acknowledge that the word 'presheaf' usually comes with an ^op, but it doesn't really matter here
[13:14:37] <joel135> we can work with C -> Set just fine
[13:15:53] <riv> so this proof about the fundamental theorem of algebra
[13:16:16] <riv> suppose a polynomial p(z) = z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + .. has no zeros
[13:16:34] <riv> then f_r(s) = [ p(r e^{2 pi i s}) / p(r) ] / | p(r e^{2 pi i s}) / p(r) |
[13:16:46] <riv> defines a loop in the unit circle based at 1
[13:17:02] <riv> i don't understand this aux definition, why do we have / p(r) in it?
[13:17:16] <riv> i get that we divide by abs so the image is the unit circle
[13:17:24] <joel135> (the domain of z |-> z^2 can also be represented directly as another category ∫ X, and there is a map, a functor, ∫ X -> C, worthy of being called a 'covering map'. this is called the grothendieck construction.)
[13:17:46] <riv> f_r : [0,2pi] --> S^1
[13:18:00] <joel135> (except that the grothendieck construction also works for C -> Cat and not just C -> Set)

[13:21:43] <joel135> the / p(r) ensures that f_r(0) = [ p(r) / p(r) ] / | p(r) / p(r) | = 1 rather than [ p(r) ] / | p(r) | which is not 1.

[13:26:38] <joel135> yes, but what is the domain?
[13:26:41] <riv> omega_n : [0,2pi] -> S^1 although we can treat both as S^1

[13:27:20] <joel135> that is correct

[14:19:29] <rubiksdream> oh, i think i managed to resolve the issue of formalizing that pictoral argument
[14:19:46] <rubiksdream> one key thing to note is that that blue line is in fact real analytic on the open interval we care about
[14:20:02] <rubiksdream> therefore in the event of infinite intersections, we can go through what happens case by case and see that this is not an issue
[14:20:18] <rubiksdream> so the meat of the proof then becomes the case of finite intersections, and this can be dealt with by staring at the picture carefully

[16:28:44] <Z-module> hi
[16:28:54] <riv> I'm curious about PSL(2,Z) acting on the half plane
[16:29:05] <riv> I think that PSL(2,Z/nZ) ~= S_n
[16:29:15] <riv> wait, S_{n+1}
[16:29:20] <Z-module> group isomorphism?
[16:29:22] <riv> yes
[16:29:27] <riv> certainly PSL(2,Z_2) ~= S_3
[16:30:19] <Z-module> well,  PSL(2, Z/pZ)  is a simple group for all primes p >= 5, so it can't be a symmetric group
[16:30:24] <riv> ah okay
[16:30:35] <riv> I just checked the ordersfor some small n and made a (bad) guess
[16:30:38] <riv> If we let L = Ker(PSL(2,Z) -> PSL(2,Z_2)), then how can I see that H/L ~= P^1 \ {0,1,inf}?
[16:31:05] <Z-module> PSL(n, F_q) is simple for all n >= 3 and all q, and for n = 2 if q >= 4
[16:31:17] <riv> for the kernel, I think we are looking at 2x2 matrics [a,b;c,d] with a=d=1,b=c=0 (the condition ab-bc = 1 is redundant)
[16:33:02] <Z-module> I forget what PSL(2,Z_2) is, something very small, right?
[16:33:44] <riv> it's S_3, joel135 showed me this which was really helpful https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/hFR9DcwC/
[16:34:09] <riv> I ran it for larger n to see what the matrices were, but im not sure how to ask for a structure description of the group they form
[16:36:47] <Z-module> What's your P^1 ?
[16:37:05] <riv> the reimann sphere
[16:37:22] <riv> P^1(C) to be precise
[16:37:38] <Z-module> oh yes
[16:37:54] <riv> I can see why P^1 \ {0,1,inf} is a figure of 8

[19:29:33] <rex_victor> but thanks a lot to you all :) I understand now better
[19:29:45] <Pi-sistance> can I briefly talk about some mechanics please? thanks.
[19:29:52] <Pi-sistance> why is dv/dx said to be -w? I see it as +w becasue the load is in the negative direction. I an only think it's a case of semantics, and iff the load is considered postive for this equation and the entire upwards is positive sign convention is ignored?
[19:30:23] <riv> Pi-sistance: v, w ?
[19:30:35] <Pi-sistance> it's pretty annoying, I have to remember in my head that the equation is NOT -w
[19:30:38] <riv> I think you have been looking at a page of math none of us can see
[19:31:05] <Pi-sistance> the change in shear force is equal to the negative of the load at that point
[19:31:22] <Pi-sistance> seems mechanics didint survive the shift to liberia sadly
[19:32:04] <cgadski> I think I know the kind of PDE you're talking about, Pi-sistance, but you should give a link to something so we can see it

[19:34:46] <Pi-sistance> upwards is positive ,a t least thats what i was taught
[19:35:26] <riv> Pi-sistance: I think that dV/dx = -w is ok
[19:35:33] <cgadski> so I guess V is the force applied to the bar at a given point. yeah, you want the force to be downwards and increasing for larger values of x, so you fix V(x) = 0 and say dV/dx = -something

[20:37:41] <[itchyjunk]> that holds for all c?
[20:37:42] <B0bby> Not much. I've tried differentiation and showing it's decreasing(it), but that didn't get me far. I'm not really familiar with these kind of inequalities.
[20:37:57] <[itchyjunk]> all c \in R?
[20:37:57] <B0bby> *(it's not decreasing everywhere)
[20:38:09] <Z-module> B0bby:  c^(2/c) = e^((2/c) ln(c)). For e = e^1 to be > that, using the monotone increasing behavior of e^x, you only need  1 > (2/c) ln(c), or  c/2 > ln(c)   (using c's positivity here).   Hmm, is that true for all c > 0 ?
[20:38:15] <somiaj> Though the computation of the area of a parabola was quite strange, they did some crazy moment formula, where they sliced it up into tiny slices, and stacked it on a point such that it balanced a leaver with another known shape, and since it was balanced, the weight/mass of the objects must be equal, and thus their area must be equal (times some moment arm)
[20:40:15] <riv> https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jqvwodd8z1 it looks like it is largest at c=e, and reaches 2.087
[20:41:15] <riv> its equivalent to showing https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ipi1duvqat 2 log(x) / x is always <= 1
[20:41:54] <B0bby> Z-module: it is, and that was actually the original form of what I was trying to prove. I thought that the inequality I posted would be easier.
[20:42:01] <Z-module> Put g(x) = x/2 - ln(x).   g is differentiable on all of (0, +infty), and g'(x) = 0  ==>  x = 2  where g has its global minimum, right?  And g(2) > 0.  That does it.
[20:42:50] <riv> you can replace log(x) with sqrt(x) - 1 i think

[23:07:52] <[itchyjunk]> i am googling these and it's hard to make head or tails of it so far
[23:08:59] <ertiportline> I started category theory this semester and I must say, it makes me add alota words to my lyx dictionary yau
[23:09:13] <riv> it's good
[23:10:02] <[itchyjunk]> hmm its a class offered to you?
[23:10:06] <[itchyjunk]> is it graduate class?
[23:10:18] <[itchyjunk]> no cat theory class is offerent in my uni for ug or graduate
[23:10:22] <qergle> ertiportline: what slant will the course take?

[23:12:54] <qergle> first clue: cs or math dept?
[23:13:09] <ertiportline> qergle, Math. It's a intro course, the prof' is algebraic geometer.
[23:13:16] <ertiportline> other then that I really dunno
[23:13:29] <qergle> aha
[23:14:00] <ertiportline> is it that much of a difference (math vs cs)?
[23:16:11] <[itchyjunk]> ertiportline, what kinda uni offers cat theory course?
[23:16:55] <ertiportline> [itchyjunk], .... ah .... my uni? a uni with pure-math-depart'
[23:17:30] <[itchyjunk]> mine has a "pure math" in the math department
[23:17:39] <[itchyjunk]> my uni is popular spot for alg geometers

[23:22:06] <isekaijin> What is wrong with algebraic geometers?
[23:22:13] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: not sure about those. You could certainly talk about noetherian rings and what makes them often useful.

[23:22:22] <Galois> we don't have a category theory course
[23:23:02] <isekaijin> What kind of things would you want in a category theory course anyway?
[23:23:05] <[itchyjunk]> Z-module, ah :(
[23:23:13] <riv> adjunctions
[23:23:27] <isekaijin> But you can learn about adjunction in the process of learning something else.
[23:23:30] <isekaijin> adjunctions*
[23:23:41] <riv> sounds good to me
[23:23:42] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: you could include such nice things as:  If A is a commutative noetherian ring then so is A[x]  (not too hard);   also, then A[[x]] is noetherian (harder).
[23:23:57] <Galois> Harvard has "Derived Categories in Geometry and Algebra"
[23:24:07] <riv> alg. geometers are the kind of people who say "oh you can just learn category theory as a by product of learning something else"

[23:25:41] <[itchyjunk]> x \in Z i mean
[23:25:46] <[itchyjunk]> or x in R ? oh..

[23:26:20] <Simplar> Gosh, that's tricky
[23:26:34] <[itchyjunk]> nice i'll do the first part, that should be enough math to banboozel my professor
[23:27:25] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: that first part is called Hilbert's Basis Theorem.
[23:27:52] <[itchyjunk]> it has hilberts name in it too! that's excillent. i was googling for "hilber noether" for past few minutes
[23:28:00] <Z-module> I guess when he did that, people hadn't yet attached the name noetherian to the ascending-chain condition.
[23:28:02] <[itchyjunk]> does that history involved they working together?

[23:31:03] <isekaijin> Commutative rings are hard enough, why bother with noncommutative?
[23:31:20] <Z-module> because of matrix rings, largely
[23:31:44] <isekaijin> Oh, so only for use as endomorphism rings of modules?

[23:39:56] <[itchyjunk]> if you have ideals I_1 subeq I_2 ... then there exists an n such that I_n = I_n+1 = .. ? what does this mean. i dont remember algebra
[23:40:36] <[itchyjunk]> ideals are of the same size, aren't they? i guesss once i fix a size, the ring gets divided into equal size things?
[23:40:44] <isekaijin> It means that you cannot have an infinite ascending chain of proper ideal inclusions.
[23:40:52] <isekaijin> At some point, the proper inclusions have to stop.
[23:41:18] <isekaijin> What do you mean by “of the same size”?
[23:41:36] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[23:41:48] <isekaijin> Every ring has the zero ideal, which has exactly one element.
[23:42:01] <isekaijin> And if the ring is not trivial, it will have other ideals, all of which have more than one element.
[23:42:10] <[itchyjunk]> if i have a ring R and i quotient it out by say r \in R, R/{r} is an ideal?
[23:42:22] <[itchyjunk]> time to refresh all the definitions..
[23:42:35] <riv> I is an ideal
[23:42:53] <riv> you can quotient by an idea, R/I
[23:43:03] <riv> {r} is not an ideal unless r=0, so you can't even quotient by that
[23:43:05] <isekaijin> An ideal has to be, first and foremost, an Abelian subgroup of the ring's additive group.
[23:44:28] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i remember the if x in I then rx in I for all r in R condition but not this subgroup condtion
