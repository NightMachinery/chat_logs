[00:00:17] <sudomann> The helptext says: "-j [N], --jobs[=N]          Allow N jobs at once; infinite jobs with no arg" does that mean it will just keep making more and more jobs as necessary till theres no ram for any more?

[00:01:00] <Dagmar> sudomann: no, it means if someone has a line in a makefile that says it needs 1000 different C files compiled, it'll try to spawn 1,000 different instances of CC to compile them all at once

[03:38:11] <Gaboradon> rcf: I do have the better sticks to, manages 20 MB/s write, someone told me that's good the other day, I did had bad stick experience, dying on me, would disconnect when it hit specific area on flash (ddrescue % blocks scanned), so yeah this was not a problem now, just wondering as I was writing a lot of big ISOs for the past few days
[03:38:20] <ayecee> rcf: sure, if you change the problem into different problem, then this could be a solution to that different problem
[03:38:26] <Gaboradon> I wanted to see if I could do anything to avoid hammering the good sticks
[03:38:29] <Mebilus> it is possible to define the channels in "sox"  using  -c 2  or  -c 8  (for 7.1)

[04:08:19] <Mebilus>        tremolo speed [depth]
[04:08:19] <Mebilus>               Apply a tremolo (low frequency amplitude modulation) effect to the audio.  The tremolo frequency in Hz is given by speed,  and
[04:08:19] <Mebilus>               the depth as a percentage by depth (default 40).

[04:08:58] <ayecee> this seems like a good time to search for a tremolo example on youtube or something
[04:09:07] <Mebilus> ok
[04:09:16] <ayecee> i can describe what a tremolo is, but it won't make it any clearer
[04:09:29] <ayecee> you pretty much have to hear it
[04:09:49] * uwharrie breaks out the TR-2
[04:09:51] <mikk0> its just a slow vibraation
[04:09:54] <Mebilus> ayecee, when I played around with it by adding / removing it from the command,  it sounds like tremolo could be "making the output louder and quieter like waves in the sea"
[04:10:08] <Mebilus> ayecee, is that it?
[04:10:13] <ayecee> yup
[04:10:21] <ayecee> a low frequency amplitude modulation :D
[04:10:38] <Mebilus> yeah... "low frequency amplitude modulation" ... because I would understand that ;)))
[04:10:45] <ayecee> amplitude - loudness
[04:10:51] <ayecee> modulation - changing
[04:11:03] <Mebilus> Does sox use pre-made files for the white noise / brown noise / etc. or is this _random_ noise generated on my computer?
[04:11:03] <ayecee> low frequency - happens slowly
[04:11:25] <ayecee> random noise generated on your computer
[04:11:32] <Mebilus> why can't they just write it like this then?  "slowly changing loudness effect"
[04:12:00] <ayecee> i think english speakers would think that's a really long way to say tremolo

[06:13:48] <dqtjy> no entry*

[06:50:17] <Uller> I am cloning disk with ddrescue and i whows "read errors: 1"(still working), is it bad?
[06:51:42] <Dagmar> Yes.
[06:51:50] <Dagmar> You'll probably need to use ddrescue
[06:51:53] <Dagmar> ;)
[06:52:28] <Dagmar> Unless you just randomly decided to use ddrescue for no reason, a read error shoudln't come as a surprise
[06:52:47] <Dagmar> Maybe it'll be able to recover it, maybe it wont'
[06:52:51] <Uller> it's just one and all other readings are fine
[06:53:01] <Dagmar> So let me guess.  You had a power failure recently?
[06:53:04] <Uller> like error rate, bad areas, bad secontors, etc, all 0
[06:53:22] <Uller> no, its normal windows 10 drive that apparently has 1 bad sector except
[06:53:32] <Uller> no software detects it except normal cloning software
[06:53:46] <Dagmar> Typically losing power unexpectely while the disk is writing can trash a sector
[06:54:11] <Uller> I cloned drive fine with WinPE AOMEI before but I messed partitioning later but it worked fine and was booting
[06:54:12] <Dagmar> This will also often affect 8-16 contiguous sectors because of the way the CRCs are written now
[06:54:30] <Dagmar> Uller: What is the built-in SMART test (the long test) saying about it?
[06:54:41] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[06:54:43] <Uller> smart was 0
[06:54:48] <Uller>  mean 0 crc etc
[06:54:58] <Uller> I think it could be some logical windows bad sector
[06:55:04] <Dagmar> So you ran the drive's built in _long_ self-test and it didn't report any errors?
[06:55:09] <Uller> or not bad sector, just sloooooow sector
[06:55:13] <Dagmar> You just have a buggered filesystem and or partition table
[06:55:25] <Uller> yeah thats what I am suspecting
[06:55:28] <Dagmar> If it's "sloooooow" then just rewrite it
[06:55:30] <Uller> not a hardware issue
[06:55:47] <Dagmar> Windows can be _very_ dumb about mangled disks
[06:55:48] <Uller> I dont want to because its OS drive and OS partition where it;s supposedly sitting
[06:55:50] <Uller> bootable
[06:55:55] <Uller> thing is, OS wrks fine
[06:56:06] <Dagmar> So did my wife's machine... for about a month
[06:56:43] <Uller> Well, I am cloning to new bigger drive now and as I said it was fine already but I think I messed with Windows security features or smth because it didn't boot for second time
[06:56:56] <Uller> as I was messing with hardare GUUID of new HDD
[06:57:02] <Dagmar> ...until Windows' repeated failure to realize that chkdsk was NOT going to fix the NTFS security descriptors--which were where the soft failed sector was--manifested in it apparently losing the permissions/ACLs for _most_ of the filesystem
[06:57:31] <Uller> tried to change it to different one from old HDD but it turned out Windows probably had some settings linked to that HDD ID and everything went messy
[06:57:50] <Dagmar> Uller: You probably should have just done an image copy with dd and then used Windows' own tools to update the partition sizes
[06:58:06] <Dagmar> Don't feel bad
[06:58:09] <Dagmar> It's not obviouis
[06:58:38] <Uller> I did sector to sector copy with AOMEI, worked fine(other programs liek Macrium or Clonezilla failed), then updated GPT in Gparted as new HDD was bigger
[06:58:51] <Uller> then I checked parition alignment, all fine
[06:59:14] <Dagmar> If the starting and ending sector numbers were the same on the new disk and you didn't try to dork with partiiton UUIDs you'd ahve been fine
[06:59:21] <Uller> so I began to create and resize new partitions using Windows diskmgmt.msc

[07:07:21] <Dagmar> You could, but the partition layout you had from the first disk should have been just fine on the new disk
[07:07:33] <Dagmar> The position of the GPT might have been an issue, but that I'm not sure about
[07:07:51] <Dagmar> What I am pretty sure of is that ddrescue isn't likely to fix this type of problem
[07:08:02] <Dagmar> It's for recovering data on disks that are failing at the hardware level
[07:08:16] <Dagmar> If you still have the original disk intact, I'd just have another go at cloning it
[07:08:31] *** Joins: punchbag (punchbag@user/punchbag)
[07:09:00] <Uller> that's what I am doing, now with ddrescue not AOMEI
[07:09:11] <Dagmar> ddrescue is overkill
[07:09:26] <Dagmar> With a _good_ disk it's basically just dd with extra steps
[07:09:37] <Uller> no because of possible bad sector
[07:09:47] <Uller> better be safe than sorry
[07:09:51] <Dagmar> If the SMART long test said there were no bad sectors then there were no bad sectors
[07:10:02] <Dagmar> The long test is a _read_ test that tests whether or not it can correctly read every sector
[07:10:06] <Uller> yet clonezilla and Macrium drop errors related to bad sectors
[07:10:09] <Dagmar> (in addition to the usual RAM tests)

[07:11:03] <Dagmar> The short test is literally short and does not test the media
[07:11:22] <Dagmar> A 4Tb disk that isn't very fancy can take > 8 hours easily
[07:11:37] <Dagmar> ...for the long test.  The short test will still complete in like 2 minutes
[07:11:52] <Dagmar> It's jsut a matter of it takes a lot of time to read that many sectors at spindle speeds
[07:12:08] <Sauvin> That's just the price you pay for having large disks.
[07:12:08] <Uller> the disk I am clonine was just 256GB that was half filled
[07:12:16] <Uller> so I got like 13min more according to ddrescue
[07:13:03] <Dagmar> If you're getting errors more or less randomly, you might still have a failing drive, but it's likely to be the electronics board that's failing or the wee tiny preamp that lives on the armature
[07:13:27] <Dagmar> ...or your motherboard
[07:13:51] <Uller> anyway speaking of GPT, partition table is being written in front and at end of drive(secondary recovery gpt)

[07:14:01] *** Joins: NealRame (~a@89.187.163.193)
[07:14:11] <Dagmar> Yeah I'd never bothered to look up where the GPT lives until a few minutes ago
[07:14:11] <Uller> so when cloning smaller drive to bigger one that secondary table ends in middle of  bigger drive
[07:14:24] <Uller> but newer gparted versions fix it atomatically
[07:14:28] <Uller> or you can use gdisk
[07:14:31] <Uller> sgdisk
[07:14:31] <Uller> etc
[07:14:51] <Dagmar> The secondary table being there isn't going to be a big deal.  Probably just opening the partition table in fdisk/gdisk/gparted/whatever and writing it right back should probably put the second copy in the expected place
[07:15:18] <Uller> when I ran gparted after cloning it automatically popped a window with quiestion
[07:15:26] <Dagmar> Altering the partition table without that happening first might wreak a bit of havoc tho

[08:33:38] <Uller> Is it reasonable to leave some unallocated space on HDD after partitioning, even few MB's?

[08:34:02] <Dagmar> Uller: It's acceptable since a lot of things want a specific multiple of sectors size

[08:35:12] <Dagmar> Uller: Another thing in favor of LVM is that you can just not bother allocating some of the volume group, and LVM can actually do useful things with it
[08:35:20] <Uller> I was thinking about something liek "breathing space" of 1GB
[08:35:27] <Dagmar> With flash storage, it just about guarantees the wear leveling has _some_ room to play
[08:35:47] <Dagmar> I usually just allocate what I know I need and leave the rest unallocated until I need it
[08:36:22] <Dagmar> 24Gb for / is about as large as I generally go for starters since it's stupidly easy to resize online when you're just growing htem
[08:36:38] <chovy> Dagmar: how big should my swap partition be?
[08:36:48] <Dagmar> chovy: That depends on how much RAM you have
[08:36:55] <Dagmar> chovy: ...and what all you're asking this host to do.
[08:37:05] <chovy> its just a web server.

[08:43:52] <chovy> yeah
[08:43:57] <jim> with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are what you would format and
[08:43:57] <jim> mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.

[11:44:48] <TudbuT> yes
[11:44:54] <Sauvin> maxzor_, see the /topic.
[11:45:15] <Sauvin> pikapika, I think most system shared objects available to unprivileged users are in protected directories.
[11:45:51] <pikapika> TudbuT, that should provide some protection against "automatic" updation at least. Though if pol or the systemwine itself do fucky shit with the prefix when they are being updated (ie apt upgrade) then that of course won't be any protection

[11:46:44] <TudbuT> pikapika if you want to prevent updates, you should also make most config files RO as to not cause any mismatching config files
[11:46:57] <pikapika> TudbuT, good point yes
[11:47:04] <Sauvin> pikapika, as I understand shared objects, they're not subject to dynamic modification anyway. Can't talk about DLLs.
[11:47:09] <pikapika> I'll have to check where it stores the registry as well
[11:47:25] <pikapika> wine uses the windows registry for a lot of config
[11:47:45] <pikapika> I know, I have tried changing strings in the text configs only to find they were hardcoded inside the registry
[11:47:46] <Sauvin> Yeah, and when the Registry gets corrupt, all KINDS of fun can ensue.

[11:54:05] <Sauvin> I wouldn't bet against TudbuT on this.

[13:56:59] <tbs-> Before i asked about kotlin and javascript and kotlin/js.
[13:56:59] <tbs-> i gave info about myself: i started to learn coding with php, i want to learn about building website to earn money so i ll learn somethings  other than php probably, try to figureout what to learn. while doing those my main goal is to be able to build mobile app.
[13:56:59] <tbs-> i ask these here becouse it is importand for me to choose things that at linux and foss side and not things like microsoft or google or nonfree side. So here i can get some answers that i hardly can get from web search.
[13:56:59] <tbs-> I wasnt active because i was studying 12 hours per day maybe :) and learned some basics of html, css, javascript. when i see those i can understand %80 of what they do but still i hardly become productive with using them ...

[14:27:43] <kurahaupo> Our industry has abused the English word "partition", twisting it from its original meaning of "boundaries inserted within an open space" to instead refer to the smaller spaces delineated by those boundaries.
[14:27:43] <kurahaupo> I suggest that the answer to "How do I resize a partition?" should be along the lines of: "The same way that you resize a paddock on a farm: you rip out a fence and put a new fence somewhere else. Also, since the filesystem is anchored to its lower boundary, you want to avoid moving that boundary if at all possible."

[16:51:59] <kernelspace> ugh
[16:52:05] <mlu> in practice, 99.9% of the time, it's nearly instant

[16:53:00] <mlu> i.e. not all registrars have an "instant release" process
[16:53:04] <koollman> I would say 0 to 7 days is common, sometimes a few dozen days
[16:53:04] <Khaytsus> kernelspace: Maybe ask your registrant?
[16:53:06] <kernelspace> Blondie101010: eh, i did the request saturday, still "Awaiting release from previous registrar."
[16:53:30] <mlu> ah yeah, 7-10 days in that case
[16:53:34] <koollman> and some registry have strict limits (both upper and lower). Others are pretty lax about what's allowed
[16:53:35] <kernelspace> registrant (old) says is all ok, that automated process is ongoing ..

[16:54:02] <kernelspace> mlu: register.it
[16:54:18] <kernelspace> ok so 7 days. i stop to check tyhe status so
[16:54:21] <mlu> hmm, inexperienced with them
[16:54:42] <mlu> if they're reasonable, they'd just release it during their next batch run or something
[16:55:05] <mlu> know one thing: if they hold on to it for a long time, it's on them for doing so
[16:55:11] <kernelspace> well ok, will wait, only issue is tha mail server down
[16:55:27] <mlu> hmm, can't receive emails on that domain?
[16:55:30] <kernelspace> so i'll lose some email likely

[19:47:52] <hodapp> it's definitely much easier if you can get either a serial terminal or ideally HDMI output
[19:48:14] <eson123> i really should have just stick with the typical raspberry Lite tho since it worked great
[19:48:20] <mikebutash_> I usually use them as a remote serial console server, so I just need to setup the sdcard for whatever local wifi, I use zerotier to connect from there
[19:48:32] <MWelchUK> If you want to use the monitor with a KB and mouse, you'll need a USB-OTG adaptor, probably with a hub.

[23:38:04] <jason1234> a mumble server would be easier to install and setup. but ... mumber isnt nice code.
[23:38:46] <bindi> jason1234: are you referring to my teamspeak hackery?

[23:44:46] <bindi> ayecee: i brought same hardware that's causing blackouts here (just a dumb switch + laptop connected directly to the ethernet pickup, public ip) to a friends place (same isp) - no issues
[23:44:54] <bindi> only difference is the basement ISP switch
[23:45:00] <bindi> huawei doing some filtering

[23:46:40] <bindi> i could try a different port as well
[23:46:45] <ayecee> i wonder though what the intent is. like i don't think they'd make a filter to "make ts3 chat work but just really unbearably bad"
[23:46:46] <bindi> direct teamspeak3 that is
[23:47:02] <bindi> i have no idea how ISP equipment works but it only causes issues when connecting to me
[23:47:07] <bindi> so i was thinking ddos protection

[23:48:27] <bindi> there was a fancy word for filtering traffic based on content, might be something like that

[23:49:29] <bindi> this used to work with the previous switch (Cisco), but got upgraded to 1 Gbps (Huawei)
[23:49:36] <ayecee> like a bitstring that just happens to look like a packet for malware
[23:50:01] <bindi> when I've concluded the tunnel testing I'm gonna attempt running teamspeak on a different port

[23:50:11] *** Quits: punchbag (punchbag@user/punchbag) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:50:25] <bindi> but way too much work for me. I've already said "connecting directly to ethernet no firewalls nothing, issue persists, pls fix"
[23:50:40] <bindi> they just ordered a serviceman to change my port in the basement, he called me, i tried to have a talk with him
[23:50:47] <ayecee> and they say "works for me, click"
[23:50:52] <bindi> "oh noo i dont know about that... i ran speedtest it seems to be fine now :)"
[23:50:59] <ayecee> bingo
[23:51:50] <rascul> speedtest all the things
[23:52:10] <jaggz> okay, yeah I do need nat working.. grr
[23:52:45] <ayecee> another interesting test would be to use a different program on that port. heck, put wireguard on that port.
