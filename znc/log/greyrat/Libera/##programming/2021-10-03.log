[00:34:13] <[itchyjunk]> because sys admin starts around 40k and maybe peaks at 80k ish mostly around here
[00:34:23] <[itchyjunk]> system engineers start at 100k+

[01:09:49] <InPhase> A signature and a hash serve different purposes.
[01:10:28] <rannnn8888> InPhase yes but in the site u send all time i write same text i get diffrent Signature
[01:10:53] <InPhase> Signatures validate that a specific sequence of data was authentically sent, hashes provide a compressed way to validate that the data corresponds to the hash if the hash value is trusted.

[01:13:03] <InPhase> rannnn8888: Signatures do not contain the text, they validate that it is correct.
[01:13:45] <InPhase> rannnn8888: ECDSA also includes a cryptographically secure random input value, which produces the variations in output that you see.  (Providing that above mentioned rainbow table defense.)

[01:17:01] *** Server sets mode: +CFnt 
[01:17:33] <InPhase> rannnn8888: Signatures cannot be used to check the equality of texts.  That's not their purpose.
[01:18:07] <InPhase> So yes, the only purpose is to validate the correctness and authenticity of the text.  If you want to check equality, generate a hash instead.
[01:20:05] <rannnn8888> InPhase so its mean its not like the Signature u send here i sure the app cheack if the text and the HASH it same
[01:20:51] <rannnn8888> and if it all time make new Signature  its mean the app not can cheack this
[01:21:16] <rannnn8888> this app work no internt and not have DB with all Signature

[01:22:40] <InPhase> rannnn8888: It's not possible to get a consistent value out of ECDSA, because it's defined to not do that.  If you want both a signature and a hash, compute both separately, and store both.
[01:23:23] <InPhase> rannnn8888: Plain sha256 will give a consistent value, as that's a hash function.  sha256 ECDSA is a signature function.
[01:25:01] <rannnn8888> InPhase ok so how i think the app know if the sha256 ECDSA signature its validate  correct ? sec i past how it look
[01:25:19] <rannnn8888> the app scan qr code and when i cheack the qr code i get this

[05:54:32] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Can I use packed structs for serialisation?
[05:54:49] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I know it's not "the right way" but it shouldn't really bite me in the arse, should it?
[05:55:45] <InPhase> Back to the same system?  Sure, usually, if it's plain data.
[05:55:56] <InPhase> To another computer?  No guarantees.
[05:55:59] <fichid> seems likely to bite you in the arse if you're dealing with different architectures
[05:56:26] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I would've thought so using ordinary structs, but packed ones with standard width data types shouldn't end badly, should it?
[05:56:40] <fichid> how "standard" are these widths lol
[05:57:18] <Thedarkb-Desktop> uint16_ts?
[05:57:21] <InPhase> Thedarkb-Desktop: Little-endian big-endian, possible different float formats (one can define IEEE-754 systems required).
[05:57:31] <fichid> yes, floats are a pita
[05:57:38] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I don't really plan on using any of those.
[05:57:49] <fichid> you have a multibyte structure, endianness is a problem
[05:57:51] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Endinaness might be an issue.
[05:58:09] <fichid> see htons
[05:58:18] <Thedarkb-Desktop> My two target architectures are big endian.
[05:58:26] <Thedarkb-Desktop> little endian*
[05:58:57] <fichid> does your transport tolerate null bytes?
[05:59:05] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Yes.
[05:59:40] <fichid> you'll hate yourself later on if you need to manage different versions, but those are the primary concerns when transmitting packed structs
[06:00:30] <fichid> stuff like protobuf isn't more complicated for no reason

[08:39:12] <arahael> Soni: Regarding your 'cursed idea', that's actually how 'checked exceptions' work, unless I've misunderstood you?
[08:39:59] <Soni> arahael: it's the reverse of how checked exceptions work. the above implementation has docs that try to describe how it's different
[08:40:06] <arahael> Soni: Ah, I see what you mean, indeed.
[08:40:24] <arahael> Soni: I don't like it. :)
[08:41:10] <Soni> arahael: it's heavily inspired by trying to write python after some time writing rust
[08:41:20] <arahael> Ooh, how does rust do this?
[08:41:26] <Soni> rust has Result
[08:41:44] <arahael> Soni: That doesnt' mean it has to return an Error in some cases.
[08:42:00] <Soni> but it's the same idea really: you make error *propagation* explicit
[08:42:21] <Soni> catching is implicit, propagation is explicit

[08:44:18] <Soni> arahael: btw python has a mechanism similar to this built-in, when it comes to how generators and StopIteration interact with eachother
[08:44:32] <arahael> Soni: Yeah, don't remind me. ;)

[08:44:58] <bayaz> Title: PEP 479 -- Change StopIteration handling inside generators 
[08:46:00] <Soni> arahael: honestly tho, how often do you see a programming language (or someone who implemented this cursed thing in a few hours) trying to do something *different* with exception handling?
[08:46:06] <arahael> Soni: Ok, that's an improvement but I still don't like it. :)
[08:46:15] <arahael> Soni: Quite often!
[08:46:29] <Soni> (... the cursedness mostly comes from how it's implemented specifically)
[08:46:54] <Soni> arahael: oh?
[08:48:21] <arahael> Soni: Purescript tries to model these with 'effects', I think, though I'm not sure so dont' quote me on that.  I don't know how Erlang does this. Windows...  Has a weird system where you can throw an exception, allow it to be handled, and then the code can return *back* to the raiser.  Haskell also does things differently, too.
[08:48:31] <Soni> java has checked exceptions and almost no modern java uses them, kotlin never had checked exceptions, C++ *deprecated* checked exceptions, python can't have checked exceptions, none have anything like this thing
[08:49:45] <Soni> arahael: returning back to the raiser seems a lot more cursed tho o.o
[08:50:19] <arahael> Soni: It makes sense, though: "I have an error, I don't know how to handle it, so raise it...  And then when it's handled and the situation has been resolved, return the control back and I'll keep going!"
[08:50:28] <arahael> Quite logical. Awful in practice.
[08:50:46] <Soni> that's terrifying
[08:50:52] <arahael> It's how threads are named, though in windows.
[08:51:15] <arahael> Internally, what's done is an exception is raised with the infromation to name the current thread. It gets handled, the OS names the thread as requested, and then it returns control.
[08:51:47] <arahael> Soni: These are called "SEH Exceptions" - that is, "Structured Exception Handling".

[08:54:38] <arahael> Soni: Oh, and yeah, I mentioned haskell.  You can "raise an exception" in pretty much any other thread, iirc.
[08:55:12] <Soni> arahael: java had that, it got removed
[08:56:20] <Soni> in any case, those things are all old. this antichecked exceptions thing? never seen it before.
[08:56:41] <arahael> Soni: You're referring to Result and cousins.  Those are also in Haskell. :)

[10:33:31] <Intelo> I got a get seat to sit on but after  a month or two, I lost the comfort. It looks the same but the comfort is gone and I feel it not soft anymore though after pressing or squeezing it, it doesn't feels that anything changed. Is that normal?

[10:48:36] <arahael> Intelo: You probably got used to it.
[10:49:29] <arahael> Btw, I wouldn't tend to recommend super-soft seats, the body is not meant to sit on super soft things so the cusion ends up putting more pressure on nerves and other places it shouldn't be.

[17:48:25] <[itchyjunk]> what happens now?
[17:48:40] <mawk> uÂ³ and -vÂ³ are roots of a quadratic
[17:48:51] <[itchyjunk]> is u^3v^3 really (1/9)^3?
[17:49:47] <mawk> uÂ³ - vÂ³ - (3uv-1/3)(u-v) = 916/27
[17:50:08] <mawk> so uÂ³-vÂ³ = 916/27 and uÂ³vÂ³ = (1/9)Â³ yes

[17:51:43] <[itchyjunk]> i did see something similar in my number theory class, you helped with it

[17:51:48] <[itchyjunk]> like 2 years ago
[17:52:06] <mawk> that means p and q are roots of UÂ²-bU+a
[17:52:19] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[17:52:27] <mawk> when you have a system like pq = ..., p+q = ..., it defines a quadratic whose roots are p and q
[17:52:37] <[itchyjunk]> so my u^3 and V^3 are roots of some unknown quadratic

[18:23:59] <mawk> yes that gives infinitely many solutions arahael 
[18:24:10] <mawk> but in this case we only care about the ones less than 3
[18:24:21] <[itchyjunk]> so each value of b gives me 2 values of x right?
[18:24:29] <mawk> because all the values that are equal mod 3 gives the same cube root

[23:22:53] <InPhase> So basically a grid of bytes will do, where 0 is empty, and other values are indices of the colors used.

[23:43:48] <golden_ticket> tane, I have to assign a value to a key. The key is the "depth" of a comment in a comment tree 
[23:44:14] <golden_ticket> hexology, merging the dictionaries would still take a long time, no?
[23:44:16] <tane> so you're creating a mapping of "depth of comment" => list of comments?
[23:44:21] <golden_ticket> yes\
[23:44:30] <tane> you _have_ to merge them anyway
[23:44:40] <tane> because you want to have a single dictionary
[23:44:54] *** Joins: snake (~snake@user/snake)
[23:44:57] <tane> so it's only inserting into the dict, no lookups, right?
[23:45:09] <golden_ticket> no
[23:45:24] <golden_ticket> it checks the dict for a key prior to appending a comment to the comment array
[23:45:34] <tane> and if the key doesn't exist it does what?
[23:45:42] <golden_ticket> creates a new array with one element
[23:45:45] <hexology> it would help if you posted pseudocode instead of making people interrogate you!
[23:45:56] <tane> yeah, that's irrelevant, not really a "lookup"
[23:45:59] <golden_ticket> sorry hexology 
[23:46:14] <golden_ticket> tane, I see. I misunderstood 
[23:46:29] <tane> if you had a "sink process" (some process that just collects tuples (depth, comment)) that would be enough
[23:46:45] <golden_ticket> okay
[23:46:46] <tane> and this process builds the dictionary, by checking if key exists, etc
[23:48:00] <hexology> you might get killed on IPC though if you send one result at a time

[23:48:06] <hexology> pickling is expensive in python
[23:48:20] <hexology> and the GIL makes doing this in true OS threads a bad idea

[23:49:22] <tane> ah damn, I still thought we were talking about actual clusters :D
[23:49:33] <tane> then I'd suggest looking at https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/advanced.html#message-passing-using-ray-queue

[23:50:09] <hexology> they said "multithreaded" so i kind of assumed that the clustering thing was the X and the "how do i do this particular comment crawling task more faster" is the Y
[23:50:32] <tane> I see

[23:51:47] <hexology> because if this is such a big operation that you're doing this in a cluster, would it make sense to just have each node write to a database? one db connection per node
