[14:36:53] <Guest82> Hi! I'm having a roswell or sbcl binary calling issue
[14:37:18] <Guest82> Specifically as it is called by qlot, but if anyone knows the sbcl arguments or ros arguments that can probably fix the problem
[14:37:26] <Guest82> I am trying to do a very simple install of utopian
[14:37:27] <Guest82> and I created a project following the getting started
[14:37:27] <Guest82> https://github.com/fukamachi/utopian
[14:37:28] <Guest82> and when I run qlot install
[14:37:28] <Guest82> I get the following error:
[14:37:29] <Guest82> https://pastebin.com/rYuT3igz
[14:37:29] <Guest82> When using slyblime, I was getting a timeout error, they suggested to change the settings like this: https://github.com/s-clerc/slyblime/issues/11
[14:37:30] <Guest82> the maximum time, load time, and setup time, and that fixed that issue for me
[14:37:30] <Guest82> I was trying to figure out where those settings are called in the sbcl bin
[14:37:31] <Guest82> or in ros
[14:37:31] <Guest82> but couldn't figure it out
[14:37:32] <Guest82> I think the issue is just that, that my computer is a bit slow, and I need to pass on some setting to the sbcl, or ros, to give it a longer timeout before declaring an error like network down
[14:37:32] <Guest82> Do you know how I can do that?
[14:38:04] <Guest82> Thanks in advance for any help :)

[19:05:44] <Guest82> Hi, just realized there are no logs for this channel. Does anyone know if anyone answered to my message earlier today?
[19:28:04] <tyson2> very few users on this channel.
[19:28:28] <tyson2> I am planning to get started with Lisp webdev using the Clog toolkit shortly

[22:28:54] <Guest82> does it cost money for the logs? or why don't we have them?
