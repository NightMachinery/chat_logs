[00:02:48] <headius> enebo: I never got the 9.2 jnr update merged so doing that in 9.3 and master now
[00:02:58] <headius> it landed on 9.2 and then I spaced out the rest
[00:05:36] <enebo[m]> I merged it this morning
[00:05:45] <headius> yeah but that was into 9.2 branch
[00:05:59] <headius> I was going to merge it to master after that and forgot
[00:06:01] <enebo[m]> yeah but I also thought I merged to 9.3 before making that brnach
[00:06:06] <headius> doesn't appear so
[00:06:13] <enebo[m]> oh hmm
[00:06:23] <headius> I just did a merge from 9.2 to 9.3 branches and those updates are missing
[00:06:36] <enebo[m]> ok
[00:06:40] <headius> it's fine, I'll have it fixed in a moment
[00:06:41] <enebo[m]> That is odd.  I wonder what I did
[00:06:50] <enebo[m]> maybe I merged to master 
[00:06:56] <headius> that's possible
[00:06:58] <headius> I will find out soon
[00:07:01] <enebo[m]> ok
[00:07:40] <headius> so the sequence for changes is potentially now: change 9.2, merge 9.2 to 9.3, merge 9.3 to master
[00:07:49] <enebo[m]> yeah
[00:07:51] <headius> hopefully we will be able to move away from much 9.2 work soon
[00:07:59] <enebo[m]> I do this every time there is anything on ARJDBC
[00:08:29] <enebo[m]> I am pretty surprised I made this mistake as I did it within 2 minutes of making the new branch
[00:16:10] <headius> enebo: I removed two defunct gems that got re-added in the merge and pushed 9.2 merge cascade everywhere
[00:16:23] <enebo[m]> oh yeah those were the ones I mentioned.
[00:16:35] <headius> ok
[00:20:37] <headius> now I have three working copies locally so intellij doesn't freak out
[01:32:48] <danieljrubyquest> Thanks for the help today! As suggested, I have filed https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6914 to document the issue with the `map` method (and, it appears, other Enumerable methods) disappearing from UnmodifiableRandomAccessList when other modules are being included. Please let me know if there's any more useful info I can provide!
[01:33:46] <danieljrubyquest> I am thinking that the issue where my app OOMs newly with the version upgrade might best be filed separately. It is actually happening on a separate Java version from the other issue. Does that make sense?
[01:57:05] <headius> Yes please
