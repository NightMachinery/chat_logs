[14:01:11] <Harag> beach: in a previous session you said "I think it was important a long time ago to optimize single	calls to CAR/CDR because lists were used as data structures then."
[14:02:49] <Harag> So out of curiosity what is use in lists place now? 
[14:04:04] <phoe> lists, still
[14:04:12] <phoe> but we also have arrays and hash tables in the standard too
[14:04:22] <phoe> so there are alternatives
[14:04:43] <Harag> ok
[14:05:32] <Harag> I use lists heavily for data structures at least at the "row" level.

[15:23:56] <phoe> the rule of thumb is, if it's fast enough for your use cases then it's the right data structure
[15:24:01] <beach> Harag: standard objects.
[15:24:18] <phoe> the thing is that usually all data structures are "fast" when you operate on tiny amounts of data
[15:24:54] <beach> Harag: Are you saying you are using fixed-length lists where each element has a particular role to play?
[15:27:20] <beach> Like for a PERSON where the first element is the NAME, the second element is the ADDRESS, etc.?
[15:36:20] <beach> Anyway, if not, the list represents a collection, and you are going to loop over the elements, so that case is more important, and I just showed that it is no more (possibly less) costly to have NIL be an ordinary symbol then.
[15:38:02] <beach> And even if yo DO use single calls to CAR and CDR, it is not so frequent these days to call them with NIL as an argument, so then, if NIL is an ordinary symbol, the cost will be the same.  In case NIL has this special representation, you still have to check that you do not have a non-NIL atom.  And if NIL is an ordinary symbol, you would start by checking for CONSP.  The cost is the same then.
