[09:39:29] <Psi-Jack> mingw is for Windows, specifically, not a cross compiler.
[09:40:40] <AmR> And It's for cross compiling as will.

[14:35:11] <Sauvin> I don't understand UNIX sockets, frankly, and have always tended to use IP.
[14:35:11] <peac> TJ-: so it seems the end-game command is `socat /tmp/printer tcp4-listen:4242,fork` on container A and `socat tcp4:localhost:4242 /tmp/printer` on container B (not sure if the order matters) with supervisord to wait for /tmp/printer to be present before starting socat on container A
[14:35:18] <Sauvin> Er, TCP. Er, whatever.
[14:35:43] <neuro_sys> Is it normal that /proc/<pid>/map_files lists the same files (shared objects) mapped several times? I see 7 entries for libc-2.21.so for instance.
[14:35:45] <peac> DLange: what do you call "normal" IP networking ?

[14:36:16] <DLange> yes, thanks Sauvin
[14:36:33] <peac> is it not what tcp4-listen will do ?
[14:36:33] <schillingklaus> unix  sockets are not that much different. Instead of IP Addresses and ports, there are paths to dedicated socket files in the file system

[16:08:35] <Ether_Man> Hey um. Is there anything similar to openrc's checkpath option that is, well, not tied to openrc? Basically, you give it a path, and tell it to verify that that path is of the correct type, has the right owner, permissions and everything. If any test fails it corrects it but doesn't touch anything that is correct. While I could say always do a chown to make sure it's owned right, and chmod to make sure permission is right, it's a bit more involved
[16:08:36] <Ether_Man>  to verify that it's say a dir without recreating it which then would nuke all the files in the dir which ofc is bad.

[17:30:37] <lpv> Nah yeah I get that. But I was buffled why it would do that. Anyway no big deal
[17:30:54] <PaulFertser> So if you need/want separate /boot you have the appropriate partition mounted to /boot and then it should have efi subdirectory where you mount the EFI system partition. And that partition usually has EFI directory.
[17:31:37] <EriC^^> having an efi dir in the efi partition is the standard, and linux just mounts the efi partition under /boot/efi
[17:31:39] <PaulFertser> Why those who developed EFI in the first place decided it's a good idea to have EFI subdirectory I do not know.

[17:56:09] <Pickchea> hexnewbie, not too shabby! Regarding mounting I've seen both version where the mountpoint is within /home/user/ and outside /home/. For a strict single user system where neither the username nor $HOME is ever going to change, is there a decisive advantage to not mount the extra drive within the home directory of the user?

[17:57:14] <PaulFertser> Iarfen: ioctls, you have libusb project to talk that.
[17:59:45] <hexnewbie> Pickchea: I mount stuff in /home/myuser, but it can confuse tools that don't check for mountpoints (e.g. ‘find ~ -mtime -1 -ls’ becomes more complex, some desktop indexers might be tripped, etc.)
[17:59:57] <MastaAce> fkdnd3: Ah i.c. others have similar issues; cawbird-twitter account tweeted recently about it: https://twitter.com/CawbirdClient/status/1458871549130420227
[18:00:39] <hexnewbie> Pickchea: For a backup, the larger issue is granting your user access to the backup (and if permissions are preserved, that would inclure write access), which would mean a cryptolocker will encrypt both your home directory and your backup, and you'll lose both if mounted

[18:06:58] <Pickchea> hexnewbie, but if I mount the drive outside /home/ in order to reap these benefits, I should also not make a link in my home directory pointing to the mountpoint, right? Otherwise these problems problems/inconveniences would still occur.

[22:54:17] <ayecee> launching virtual machines is like the least important part of this decision.
[22:54:25] <jwll> a driver is something the operating system uses to talk to, e.g., a device

[22:56:46] <jwll> (for example, if the device is a network interface of some sort, the firmware is needed before you load the driver... if it's there available to load, the driver will successfully initialize itself, and you get a network interface

[23:22:25] <esselfe> pretty sure beer would make it worse :P

[23:32:57] <tahc> It's proprietary, if you listen closely you can hear stallman screaming in the distance in agony.
[23:33:11] <ayecee> but those docs won't help much for linux.
[23:33:28] <Sauvin> bullgard4, let me tell you a story about a guy with a question about grep. He wanted a particular syntax to work, couldn't make it, asked about it here where users DID make it work on their machines.
[23:33:50] *** Joins: robert__ (~trebko@137.220.86.97)
[23:33:53] <Sauvin> We went around for hours and hours before somebody thought to ask "What version of grep are you using, and on what OS?"

[23:34:16] <ayecee> the neverending story
[23:34:32] <Sauvin> He was a Mac user. When we yelled at him for not disclosing that fact, he got all "It's all the same !@#$@%# stuff!", and we pointed out "No, it isn't, and  you just saw what we're talking about!"

[23:35:39] <oerheks> open radeon is supported in the kernel, throwthecheese
[23:35:44] <n4dir> In such cases it is even more difficult. BSD based commands are often exactly the same, hence you can easily assume they are always the same. When they are not they bite you without you understaning it, Sauvin
[23:35:58] <n4dir> there are the posix-manpages in debian, i assume they kinda handle that problem
[23:36:15] <tahc> I mean, you should at least know that GNU programs have extensions to them.
[23:36:19] <Sauvin> n4dir, BSD commands tend not to have gnu extensions and are often older versions of stuff.

[23:36:44] <ayecee> moreg24: the error message would give you some help there
[23:36:45] <Sauvin> moreg24, nope, and this isn't the place to ask. Freenode is dead, may it rest in pieces.
[23:36:45] <bullgard4> ayecee, thanks to your hint I found a wonderful article that brings me forward: https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.quality-of-service.html ,- Thank you very much for your help.
[23:36:50] <ayecee> :)
[23:37:06] <Sauvin> bullgard4, now THAT looks a lot better.
[23:37:07] <tahc> Even just reading the --help or man page of GNU grep vs BSD grep should give you an idea of differences.
[23:37:22] <throwthecheese> Any idea where these glitches come from?
[23:37:26] <Sauvin> Yup. BSD grep is a lot more primitive.
[23:37:34] <n4dir> at least you run in BSD or Mac now and then. AIX seems close to a myth like me. :-)

[23:54:28] <hexnewbie> There are better uses of it than convincing people to try the weather under several layers of soil
[23:54:34] <xx> probably is gonna receive a job offer from scammers in their email now, you really should click that link tahc ;)
[23:54:34] <jason1234> tahc will create a new gnu community, our guru

[23:55:28] <ayecee> hexnewbie: perhaps, but that would require deliberate use and not unconscious habits.
[23:55:39] * kfrench falls asleep.
[23:55:46] <tahc> I don't know why we went from me suggesting a telnet connection to tell you the weather to this.

[23:56:06] <ayecee> yeah, you've made that quite clear
[23:56:41] <tahc> I literally just said you *could* get the weather from a telenet server. It was xx who thought it must be a prank of some sort.
[23:56:43] <ayecee> also that you're not interested in understanding why.

[23:57:05] <tahc> Because we were talking about getting the weather from the command line.
[23:57:31] <ayecee> okay, well, try not to pee on the carpet while we're gone.

[23:58:54] <tahc> I could twist your arm telling you not to connect to foo bar irc channel. Be careful #C is clearly dangerous.
[23:58:55] <jason1234> why telnet? when wget is by default in all single linux

[23:59:49] <tahc> Because I thought it was an interesting tidbit. Jesus christ, you autists have been dragging this conversation on longer than it should have.
