[06:01:15] <Fiji> i actually am not sure what to think of a psychiatrist trying to use a lot of clinically unproven techniques on a group of people
[06:02:20] <Fiji> i think it would be better if he stuck to proven stuff instead of a lot of what he talks about given the wide audience
[06:02:41] <Fiji> itd be different if he was just another medtuber just spouting whatever garbo, but he is running a business

[09:49:05] <Selavi> evilgohan2, it gave me more appreciation for the old movie, at least. the movie is missing a ton of story and is super '80s, but the characters are fairly faithful as Herbert put them from my reading. the show goes into much more of the story, especially Liet and Fremen, but added quite a few plot lines and some of the characters are insulting, especially Paul
[09:50:48] <Selavi> this is coming from someone who only read Dune for the first time in the last couple weeks... so I'm curious should anyone have other thoughts about the show
[09:53:28] <Selavi> and Dune is the first book I've read cover to cover in years. really enjoyed it. especially appreciated the emphasis on awareness of and within characters. looking forward to reading at least the next 2 books

[22:13:56] <joepie91> Allie: they are very likely in violation merely by obtaining it
