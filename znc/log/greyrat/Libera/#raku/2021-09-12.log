[12:02:12] <Summer> is there any way currently to bundle a bunch of raku, an interpreter la rakudo, etc, into a single executable file?
[12:03:48] <moon-child> rakudo is a compiler, not an interpreter
[12:04:09] <moon-child> and, not as far as I know.  You can easily make an archive that extracts itself somewhere and runs
