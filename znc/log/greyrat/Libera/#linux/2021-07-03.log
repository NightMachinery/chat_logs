[04:04:24] <Dagmar> The good news is that so long as you make sure the _block count_ for each partition is the same or larger on the new drive, you can partition the new drive with GPT and then copy each partition with dd
[04:04:43] <Dagmar> Resizing ext4 to grow to fill the rest of a partition is super-easy, and the same goes for LVM

If you had a question, had to pay for vendor support. And every release (about every year) would radically change the fundamental structure of the language so all code had to be rewritten and everybody had to attend new classes.

[07:33:25] <vwork> They have the highest dropout rate by a huge margin
[07:33:52] <twainwek> if they have a large dropout rate it's because people who go there don't like to commit
[07:34:41] <twainwek> or they're working fulltime
[07:34:53] <vwork> Well yeah, but some of them actively attract people they expect to drop out. Because they get paid regardless, and if the student stops showing up they don't have to expend anything "teaching" them

[07:37:07] <rascul> i learned in high school that the trick to getting high during school was to go outside in the parking lot and sit in between parked cars because when the teachers walked the parking lot they never looked in between the cars so i would hit the bowl and exhale underneath the car so it would go out the other side and mostly disperse before anyone

The Kernel works but I always miss modules for common tasks like Docker, NFS, iSCSI and so in in Debian.

[18:39:50] <curdlesnoot> kilobyte_ch: I don't know why you think you have to configure it from scratch. the defconfig is one potential starting point. if you've already gone to the trouble of patching in the fetures you want, keep the .config file and use that as the starting point, not defconfig.

[18:48:12] <curdlesnoot> I'm not sure it provides much value because defconfigs tend to be quite skeletal and rely heavily in practice on the defaults defined in the Kconfig files.
[18:48:20] <curdlesnoot> nevertheless, if that's how you want to do it, you can.
[18:48:41] <curdlesnoot> it will probably just produce not-very-readable diffs.
[18:48:55] <curdlesnoot> (easier just to read the original .config, imo)
[18:49:21] <curdlesnoot> hmm.

[18:50:31] <curdlesnoot> that should be readable.
[18:50:41] <curdlesnoot> but then it produces something that can't be applied to the original defconfig.
[18:50:52] <kilobyte_ch> Thats no problem I think

[23:41:17] <thermatix> but
[23:41:22] <curdlesnoot> tmux isn't going to coerce programs into unbuffering themselves, though.

[23:41:38] <curdlesnoot> don't get me wrong, it's useful. but ... as concerns the problem at hand.
[23:41:50] <thermatix> so you can experiment faster
[23:41:59] <Dagmar> hajonnes: basically, interpreters _try_ to guess at what they're outputting to and in some cases may enable autoflush on stdout just to reduce the number of newbie support complaints

[23:42:20] <Dagmar> hajonnes: sudo makes it hard for that stuff to tell if it's writing to an output file or someone's console that's being viewed in realtime
[23:42:25] <curdlesnoot> but, even then, it's often based on the logic of whether stdout is a tty or not. and, of course, being a pipe, it isn't anyway.
[23:42:44] <curdlesnoot> it's one of those situations where you're going to have to ask for what you want, most likely.
[23:43:00] <thermatix> wooot
[23:43:05] <thermatix> yumi seems to have worked
[23:43:08] <Dagmar> When autoflush _isn't_ enabled on a filehandle, whatever write() calls are made to it just wind up putting that data into a _buffer_ until the buffer reaches a certain size and it gets flush()d which actually makes the write happen

[23:57:40] <NthDegree> at that point I decided to just use the integrated GPU, I'll try the NVIDIA proprietary drivers again once they release the next major branch

[23:58:00] <NthDegree> by then they should have fixed the choice between tearing or crap performance on general (non-3D) workloads

[23:59:33] <NthDegree> hajonnes, try nouveau and see if you get the same result as a test run
