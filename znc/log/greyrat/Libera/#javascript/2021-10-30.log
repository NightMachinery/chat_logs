[01:25:51] <tatiana> i'm practicing/learning ES6 modules and lodash is handy so want to be able to import just the lodash function in without using the whole lodash.js file, with and without webpack
[01:26:18] <ljharb> tatiana: you can't do anything without a bundler.
[01:26:30] <ljharb> tatiana: modern web dev requires it, and that includes "using npm packages in the browser"
[01:26:48] <ljharb> tatiana: so, with a bundler, `import throttle from 'lodash/throttle'` should work just fine
[01:27:39] <tatiana> oh ok
[01:28:17] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[01:28:32] <tatiana> `import throttle from 'lodash/throttle'  <--- is that using lodash-es, installing it via npm i -D?
[01:28:43] <ljharb> don't use lodash-es. use normal lodash.
[01:28:54] <ljharb> and not `-D`, that's for dev deps. use `npm install --save lodash`
[01:29:37] <tatiana> ok, i install webpack on an individual basis ie per project don't i , using -D?

[08:08:21] <tatiana> I don't think it would be - sourceMap: true,

[08:09:47] <Gamara> thanks so much :)
[08:10:41] <tatiana> by default it does 2 versions back, if u don't configure .browserlist it should still work i think
[08:11:41] <Gamara> yeah I use webpack merge
[08:12:21] <Gamara> but yeah even with you config same error it might be because im using webpackgulp
[08:14:25] <tatiana> i'm learning webpack and was doing this the other day and had a simple config, that's why i put in my 2 cents worth, webpack can be really fickle. good luck with it

[15:08:54] <stenno> dunno what you mean with 'slower technology' exactly but the speed of invention and innovation is going up exponentially

[15:09:30] <OnkelTem> Yeah, of course. And yet... it becomes bigger, slower
[15:09:32] <deniska> OnkelTem: I've heard there's esbuild if you gotta go fast
[15:09:50] <stenno> saying that technology slows down because building software is more complex than it used to be is a bit silly
[15:10:07] <tatiana> history repeats itself in a way, before it was important to worry about efficiency but then computers got faster and there were bloated libraries, then mobile got big and suddenly, bloated websites were a problem and efficiency was important again
[15:10:21] <deniska> pascal is relatively simple to compile, its compilers were always fast

[15:11:50] <tatiana> i could build windows forms linked to databases 50 metres away or link a web frontend to a server on the other side of the world and the web frontend is faster than a server 50 metres away
[15:11:58] <deniska> OnkelTem: but take a look at esbuild, their entire shtick is being fast
[15:12:01] <OnkelTem> stenno: I know. I'm just sitting here and frustrating: I need to change my laptop with a uber-fast PC now
[15:12:18] <OnkelTem> to not suck that much I mean in building
[15:12:48] <OnkelTem> stenno: yeah, webpack/react... WebFuckingStorm for which I pay every year
[15:12:59] <stenno> oh not familiar with webstorm
[15:13:28] <tatiana> things get bloated, it happened with windows
[15:13:32] <stenno> are you sure you are always building exactly the parts you need to build
[15:13:44] <tatiana> demands become higher
[15:13:45] <stenno> and not just everything all the time with database fixture initialization and so on
[15:13:55] *** Quits: Enissay (~Enissay@user/enissay) (Client Quit)
[15:14:34] <tatiana> but delphi was efficient, sometimes u get things that don't get bloated, delphi was good

[15:22:14] <deniska> OnkelTem: did you ignore the mentions of esbuild? It's quicker than alternatives
[15:22:48] <deniska> OnkelTem: (it doesn't support everything webpack et al might be used for, but it's still quite compatible)
[15:23:03] <OnkelTem> deniska: is it a drop-in replacement compatible with CRA?

[15:23:47] <deniska> CRA is a template of a project, seems to be there're customized templates: https://github.com/pradel/create-react-app-esbuild
[15:26:27] <OnkelTem> deniska: interesting! Thanks. However... I know what makes building perticularly slower. When building a production buid - it's the Terser webpack plugin. It itself adds approximately 30-40 seconds.
[15:27:15] <deniska> OnkelTem: so, a minimizer? esbuild can do that
[15:27:17] <OnkelTem> as for the live/dev/integral rebuilds - it's the ts checker mostly
[15:27:50] <deniska> as far as TS goes, iirc esbuild can translate TS to JS but without doing much type checking
[15:28:16] <OnkelTem> babel is fast at that, yeah
[15:28:27] <OnkelTem> stripping types - not a big deal ;-)
[15:29:29] <sickdyd> I want to have `interface IDecks { decks: IDeck[] }` without having to access `.decks`, should I use `type IDecks: IDeck[]`? Or is there a way to use interface?

[16:29:33] <tatiana> depends on how much you love life
[16:30:14] <Covrus> well, assuming both life and money are desirable (opportunity and means) I'd say time, because if you have infinite time you just keep hammering away until the money becomes not an object

[16:31:54] <tatiana> when people say "money is time", time is much more important than money. If you can get away from the money issue
[16:32:02] <stenno> i agree tatiana

[17:04:05] <D4mned> hmm
[17:04:15] <D4mned> what is the proper way to check validity of emails ?
[17:04:30] <earendel> i would use regex
[17:04:33] <earendel> lol
[17:04:36] <D4mned> lol
[17:04:47] <D4mned> i mostly use packages for that
[17:04:58] <D4mned> they all use regex i guess
[17:04:58] <Covrus> well, the "proper regex" for a compliant email is like four pages long

[17:07:09] <Covrus> and bang paths are still supported, so theoretically if you used one because you're stuck in the early 80s it should work
[17:07:30] <earendel> .+@.+
[17:07:58] <earendel> good enough? or just at least 1 char
[17:08:32] <Gamara> https://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-127ed?file=/index.js I tried throwing my problem into a sandbox but no luck getting it to run
[17:09:57] <tatiana> the guy who wrote that 4 pg regex is now trying to break out of rehab
[17:10:08] <Gamara> iprobably no css thats why
[17:10:11] <earendel> Gamara: did the forked playground work for you?
[17:10:38] <Covrus> well, if you're trying to ACTUALLY validate email addresses such that they comply with the spec, the regex works... it's just really long
[17:10:48] <Covrus> which is why you'd import it from somewhere else
[17:11:11] <Gamara> nothing works :/ my problem is so frustrating because it should work, all I am doing is changing a state between components and I am getting unreliable onClick state change

[17:11:40] <earendel> i really would just send a mail. the client side validation should at best help the user to see a mistake.
[17:11:41] <Gamara> like sometimes I click it and it changes the state, other times I click it 50 times and the state doesnt change

[21:14:57] <lantech19446> am I crazy in thinking that jquery has to be invoked somewhere similar to bootstrap you can't just use it without ever calling it right?
[21:16:38] <qswz> for bootstrap < 5 I think it required jquery if you don't use the bundle with jquery included

[21:19:23] <lantech19446> well I know we use bootstrap so qswz may be on to something and according to lighthouse we're using jquery 1.9
[21:20:20] <systemfault> lantech19446: What patch number though? 1.9.?
[21:20:54] <systemfault> lantech19446: Maybe there's a version of 1.9.x that was released after the one you're currently using that doesn't have the vulnerability
[21:21:46] <systemfault> lantech19446: What I'm saying is... as long as you stay in the 1.x.x versions, it should not break that much (maybe not at all)
[21:22:12] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[21:22:19] <systemfault> Last 1.x is, according to the website, 1.12.4
[21:23:06] <lantech19446> systemfault: it's 1.9.0 and I just ran https://lansdalelibrary.org/?hsNoJQery=true which i'm lead to believe disables jquery and it still loaded perfectly so maybe it is just bootstrap
[21:23:28] <lantech19446> but that means I don't know how to update whether i need to update bootstrap or can I still just update the jquery library
[21:23:44] <systemfault> I'd try to just update jQuery

[23:03:49] <qswz> ljharb: that's a bit opinionated
[23:04:14] <qswz> if we poll the 39 knights of TC39, how many are against AbortController?
[23:04:28] <qswz> they are more thzn 39 now tho

[23:04:48] <qswz> so it made it to the specs somehow
[23:04:51] <ljharb> but since it exists since a tc39 proposal was snuck into the language via fetch instead of properly inside tc39, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:04:54] <stenno> dunno why i associated abortcontroller with stream.cancel()
[23:05:16] <ljharb> it made it to the web spec, because it doesn’t take as much to get in there. Especially when it’s driven by specific people.
[23:05:42] <qswz> it's JAck Archibald fault so
[23:05:48] <ljharb> nope
[23:05:54] <ljharb> but i don’t want to talk about specific people.
[23:06:07] <qswz> ok ok :)
[23:06:09] <ljharb> either way it doesn’t belong in node at all
[23:06:32] <ljharb> but the “be like browser” folks keep adding dumb stuff to node :-(
