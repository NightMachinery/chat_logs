[11:02:18] <sd> 11<H​otmess> governor general is the usal proxy for the queens authority
[11:02:38] <sd> 11<H​otmess> techianly she could fly over to canada and do it in person
[11:02:44] <sd> 11<H​otmess> if uk parlment lets her leave uk
[11:02:57] <sd> 11<H​otmess> that part the monarch actually needs parlments permission
[11:02:57] <Hunterkll> Parliament has held the power of impeachment since medieval times. Originally, the House of Lords held that impeachment could apply only to members of the peerage; however, in 1681 the Commons declared that they had the right to impeach anyone, and the Lords respected this resolution.
[11:03:03] <Hunterkll> seems though
[11:03:13] <Hunterkll> it hasn't been used since....... 1806
[11:03:13] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> is she trying to outlive her kids?
[11:03:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i assume thats impechment form the house of lords
[11:03:23] <Hunterkll> no 
[11:03:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its probably not even legal now
[11:03:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> due to all the current laws
[11:03:37] <Hunterkll> it's commons submitting to lords
[11:03:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> uk sup court would decide or not
[11:04:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> however the crown act 1979 still governs all of that stuff
[11:04:09] <Hunterkll> In addition to the power of impeachment, the House of Commons claims the right to discipline offenders, both members and non-members, a right that has been accepted by the courts
[11:04:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hillarously boris has lost twise now in sup court by invoking the queens powers instead of going to parlment
[11:04:43] <Hunterkll> that process is considered "obsolete" but still valid 
[11:04:53] <Hunterkll> seems there's an abolition movement of that power 
[11:05:03] <sd> 11<H​otmess> if queenie likes boris there is nothing parlment can do about it
[11:05:14] <Hunterkll>  The principles of "responsible government" require that the Prime Minister and other executive officers answer to parliament, rather than to the Sovereign. Thus the Commons can remove such an officer through a motion of no confidence without a long, drawn-out impeachment (though if such officer refuses to stand down in such a case, it remains to be seen what other devices can be used to remove them from office other 
[11:05:14] <Hunterkll> than impeachment).
[11:05:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as he weilds her power at her discrection
[11:05:34] <Hunterkll> her power is rather bound, however

[22:23:17] <DSee> NAS hardware RAID controllers are crapping out (BBU, etc)... IBM M5015 w/ BBU (aka LSI MegaRaid 9260-8i). At this time & age, are hardware cards still worth it or is ZFS the way to go?
[22:23:45] <CableNinja> "it depends"
[22:23:51] <DrZak> how would zfs help when the power goest to crap
[22:24:05] <DrZak> if it has data in transit, they are done
[22:24:29] <DrZak> if the bbu are kinda safeguard for that
[22:24:29] <DSee> Add a mid-sized UPS? :-)

[23:58:05] <catbeard> you can just DNAT to your DoT endpoints and it will make CloudFlare Teams resolvers do the lookups
