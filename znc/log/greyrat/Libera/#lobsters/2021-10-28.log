[00:04:55] <kline> oh
[00:04:59] <kline> i didnt read far enough up
[00:05:05] <kline> Brekkjern | Just calling gc.disable() actually improves the runtime of my script by nearly 50%
[00:05:08] <kline> this was all i saw
[00:05:25] <Brekkjern> A friend of mine made a program that would flash LED lights in sync with the music and it was powered by a battery bank. He calculated that it would OOM after the battery ran out so he didn't bother dealing with it
[00:05:30] <kline> and i thought "yeah, if you dont care about long term memory leaks then no dramas"
[00:05:32] <Brekkjern> Yeah, that was from reading that instagram post
[00:05:54] <Brekkjern> This improvement is actually pretty dumb...
[00:06:11] <Brekkjern> It lowers the runtime of my script by 20-40 seconds...
[00:06:24] <Brekkjern> Like... It's actually stupid how much faster it is
[00:07:57] <kline> theres a lot of stuff like this
[00:08:00] <kline> UB in C for example
[00:08:29] <kline> you can optimise huge amounts of safety code if you tell the compiler that its not necessary
[00:08:48] <kline> it might be less safe, but so is never cleaning up memory until your process terminates
[00:10:43] <Brekkjern> That's essentially what I am doing now. I just let the script calculate the graph and find the path from the task they gave me, and then terminate
[00:12:01] <Brekkjern> Cleaning up the memory is kinda pointless except for a few somewhat large arrays used for Djikstra, but it's not like they are so huge that they use all the memory.

[00:46:42] <meff[m]> idk for a lot of scripts, I feel like it makes a lot of sense to just preallocate an arena and allocate inside that
[00:49:03] <ngoldbaum> in grad school i used a fortran HPC CFD code to do research, it allocated all memory for the calculation at start, if your problem dynamically grew to be larger than the amount of computational blocks you specified at the beginning the code would crash
[00:49:30] <ngoldbaum> it made a lot of things a lot simpler and avoided issues you get doing dynamic memory management like memory fragmentation

[02:31:10] <c355E3B> I will say, i've been able to quickly pivot from Ruby to C++ and I blame Rails for that

[02:33:41] <drakonis> its a poorly implemented idea though
[02:33:58] <technomancy> that reminded me of that thing I wrote in 2009 to let you deploy rails apps using solely rubygems https://github.com/technomancy/harker

[02:37:46] <c355E3B> 90% of our customer facing code gets shipped via maven
[02:38:24] <c355E3B> So when our stuff boots, it does regular old maven operations to grab all of the components it needs
[02:38:39] <technomancy> yeah, I guess that makes sense
[02:38:43] <c355E3B> what that means is 1. when it needs to be air-gapped, customers can use the standard maven mirroing crap to do it
[02:38:49] <c355E3B> (which saves a shit load of time)
[02:39:02] <c355E3B> and 2. on the dev side, its all maven commands to update/release new versions of components
[02:39:06] <c355E3B> it breaks in two painful ways

[22:44:45] <c355E3B> I feel like ElementaryOS is the "usable" gnome at this point.
[22:45:01] <c355E3B> Gnome is also the major reason why I've given up on linux desktops
[22:45:02] <feoh> Elementary is super great in a TON of ways
[22:45:08] <imode> use KDE Plasma.
[22:45:11] <imode> it doesn't suck(tm).
[22:45:19] <jj5> KDE Plasma FTW
[22:45:32] <feoh> It's much better to be sure. I'm currently running Fedora 35 KDE beta as my dual boot OS
[22:45:33] <imode> I'm an arch+i3 man though.
[22:45:46] <feoh> But I'm a filthy stinking Windows user mostly as my desktop of choice. *ducks*

[22:46:09] <companion_cube> intresting ;)
[22:46:13] <c355E3B> Does it have a working screen reader and vector graphics editor?
[22:46:17] <cb_> i have gnome takes but i'm on a call rn
[22:46:22] <imode> companion_cube: more taste than you think. :P
[22:46:25] <c355E3B> also is KDE still qt?
[22:46:28] <imode> just gotta get to know me.
[22:47:17] <feoh> c355E3B: Yes KDE is still Qt. It has some screen reader capabilities but I've talked to other blind techies who say it's not very good. I'm just partially blind which is a totally different world :) I just need screen zoom and bumped font sizes so I'm lucky in that way.
[22:47:52] <companion_cube> imode: poking at you
[22:48:03] <companion_cube> of course you could also be an OCaml fan, but no one is that perfect
[22:48:06] <feoh> But KDE's screen zoom works whereas Gnome's has been flat busted since Ubuntu 19.10 and the bug just .... sits there with people endlessly +1-ing it. It got triaged as medium which is IMO pretty bogus given how many people are unable to run it as a result.
[22:48:28] <imode> my work on "term rewriting on the metal" has gained me some friends in ivory towers.

[22:53:03] <drobilla> (Both technically and organizationally)
[22:53:50] <feoh> rb: OK I LOVE 'legacy radiation' ! Only its rate is inversely correlated with the software's age :) The older it gets the more legacy radiation it gives off. What's that measured in - 'lrems' ? :)
[22:54:25] <feoh> So, like a 10 year old Java codebase would emit maybe 15 lrems per minute whereas 1960s COBOL would emit 500 :)

[22:54:56] <feoh> heh
[22:55:17] <letoram> feoh: it's magnify + pan mapped to an input device, what is needed on the display server level is t he same - there are a few other tricks I think works well for that level of visual impairment (sobel-filter+bias) but are practically untested
[22:56:11] <letoram> but it's on the edge where more audio queues start to become useful - not full screen reading but notification of events outside the zoom+pan
[22:56:18] <feoh> letoram: Indeed. Compiz had this umpteen years ago. As someone who was running Linux off of H.J. Lu's boot/root floppies, I find it super ironic that Linux has become, on the whole, LESS accessible over time rather than more :(

[23:00:09] <rb> never had to deal with WebSphere
[23:00:10] <c355E3B> Yeah, java has a decade in which it went off the deep end
[23:00:13] <c355E3B> the modern stuff is fine though
[23:00:45] <rb> currently i'm dealing with modern Enterprise:TM:, which consists of beating docker with a wrench until it starts not giving errors
[23:01:15] <rb> i had to turn our private registry off and on again, otherwise it wouldn't allow you to pull images that were pushed 5 seconds ago
[23:02:04] <rb> we currently have a very epic setup in which there are multiple VMs on a dedicated server and each of the VMs run a bunch of docker containers in a weird attempt to encapsulate services
[23:02:17] *** Joins: rany (~rany@user/rany)
[23:02:50] <rb> all of the VMs running buster of course, because this place seems to be allergic to recent versions of software

[23:19:10] <Church> feoh: Tweaking font sizes and zoom per application is annoying.
[23:19:32] <Church> It of course gets worse when I need to apply a per webpage/site font and zoom level >_>

[23:29:44] <iDrougge> That reminds me I need to dedicate a day or two to screenreader-proof the app I'm working on.
[23:30:13] <iDrougge> It is already built consciously to use adaptive font sizes, though no-one ever tests that.
