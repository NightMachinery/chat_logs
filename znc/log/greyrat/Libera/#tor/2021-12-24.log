[04:51:36] <jkk> fain“1” means splitting large packets into MTU-size packets instead of letting the network drivers do it. Here, the MTU is 1448 bytes for the Obfs4 Bridge. This means the smaller packets cannot be reassembled for analysis and censoring. Figure 10 shows the code snippet of Obfs4 used to compute the MTU size.
[04:51:39] <jkk> seems neat
[04:52:14] <xx> all VPNs do that too, for obvious reasons
[04:52:35] <xx> in fact, most software has some sort of detection of max MTU
[04:52:59] <xx> without it, internet would be even slower, laggier and error-prone
[04:53:42] <jkk> MTU is defined as the largest packet or frame size that can be used to transmit data. Network drivers split large packets into MTU size packets (negotiated in the TCP handshake), which can easily be reassembled – and identified by censors as well.
[04:53:49] <jkk> yet to understand
[04:54:12] <jkk> “0” means that the IAT-mode is disabled and that large packets will be split by the network drivers, whose network fingerprints could be detected by censors.
[04:54:21] <jkk> some metadata from network drivers?
[04:56:08] <jkk> also what's wrong with public obf bridges?
[04:57:09] <xx> public ones will already be blocked
[04:57:17] <jkk> right
[04:57:19] <xx> if you're in a country that already tries to block tor
[04:57:28] <jkk> someone of them are not public they are simply assigned
[04:57:30] <xx> it's trivial to ask for a bridge, so that's what they do
[04:57:36] <xx> hence you need to run them yourself or ask a friend
[04:57:43] <jkk> they keep asking for bridges 
[04:57:43] <jkk> hmm
[04:57:47] <xx> yeah
[04:57:51] <xx> they pretend to be users
[04:58:21] <jkk> hmmm
[04:58:22] <jkk> hmmm
[04:58:30] <xx> anyway, if you're on the level of being worried about network drivers, it's probably best to boot into tails instead of using tor on your regular system
[04:58:38] <xx> that way you have the same fingerprint as every other tails user
[04:58:47] <jkk> I am not worried or not simply reading to understand
[04:59:22] <jkk> what can be done 
[04:59:36] <jkk> privacy 'limits'
[05:01:48] <jkk> so when I use something I have idea how private it is :)
[05:02:05] <jkk> also tails uses linux kernel with blobs
[05:02:18] <jkk> some blobs are network driver or something like that Xd
[05:02:21] <xx> still better than windows, which is what majority of users use
[05:02:30] <jkk> aHAHAH Xd
[05:02:30] <xx> or poorly configured linux, which is what the other large group of users use
[05:02:44] <jkk> open bsd seems nice
[05:03:03] <jkk> i am privacy addict Xd
[05:03:55] <xx> if you were, then you wouldn't use pidgin
[05:04:34] <jkk> which client do you recommend?
[05:04:37] <jkk> GUI one
[05:04:53] <xx> I've heard some things about hexchat
[05:04:57] <jkk> any client can be targeted by 0 days
[05:05:02] <xx> but I don't use gui clients
[05:05:07] <jkk> why people say pidgin is da only one
[05:05:23] <jkk> also maybe pidgin in jail
[05:05:29] <jkk> so it cant escalate
[05:05:29] <xx> first rule of internet: vast majority of what people say is absolute bullshit
[05:05:54] <xx> pidgin is using libpurple library, which is very poorly designed and is a source of continuous security issues
[05:06:30] <xx> also, is that protonvpn?
[05:06:35] <jkk> ?
[05:06:38] <xx> nevermind
[05:06:50] <jkk> I dont use proton vpn lol
[05:07:58] <jkk> simply jail it
[05:08:08] <jkk> and if it tries something funny log :)
[05:08:28] <jkk> i would not claim that other irc clients have no vulns
[05:08:42] <jkk> plus people in pidgin saying its not that bad
[05:08:51] <jkk> in #pidgin
[05:10:32] <jkk> I might install open bsd haha
[05:11:09] <jkk> it is clear that so called privacy is not absolute in a way
