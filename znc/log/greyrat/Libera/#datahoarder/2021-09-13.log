[19:23:21] <ThePendulum> what's the white rose
[19:25:01] <zaggynl> UK based covid resistance group, from the looks of it
[19:25:12] <zaggynl> *covid measures resistance group
[19:25:46] <zaggynl> comparisons between WW2 and covid restrictions, geez
[19:28:09] <skye0_mobile> and slavery and genocide
[19:28:17] <skye0_mobile> they're dangerous fucks. i hate how they have influence here
[19:28:27] <slothpaw> i thought that was the who point of the resistance movement to prevent corporate technocratic take over of the world by using V & VX % 5G turning it into a everything track & traced, monitored corporate prison planet
[19:28:36] <skye0_mobile> i want to take them to india, afghanistan, the US/Mexico border or Xinjiang to SHOW THEM what real slavery and genocide look like
[19:29:08] <skye0_mobile> they stole the name of an actual anti-Nazi group

[19:30:00] <skye0_mobile> not just the UK too
[19:30:01] <skye0_mobile> sadly
[19:32:44] <skye0_mobile> "Covid-19 is not more dangerous than the seasonal flu." The privilege is strong in this one.
[19:35:55] <ThePendulum> tbf you probably want to start resisting slavery and genocide before we get to china levels, but probably not in this fashion
[19:36:29] <skye0_mobile> yeah they think vaccines and lockdowns are oppression, it's like someone with lots of clothes saying the cold is oppression
[19:36:49] <skye0_mobile> lockdowns suck but not nearly to the level of the fucked up shit governments and institutions get away with
[19:36:53] <slothpaw> i think that is the technocratic corporate agenda to make the world like china
[19:37:39] <skye0_mobile> they see money in china because 1bn people live there, many living in big cities. initially china was used for cheap labor
[19:38:13] <slothpaw> by use of gain of function virus, vax with graphine 5G attenuator and nano tagged tracker, and 5G every where
[19:38:16] <zaggynl> I don't like the whole corona pass thing, but if people don't want to vaccinate, how do you handle this?
[19:38:40] <zaggynl> wait until ~x% of the population dies?
[19:39:16] <slothpaw> 3 of my relations died shortly after vx :(
[19:39:41] <slothpaw> everyone heres knows someone who either died of got real sick 
[19:40:51] <slothpaw> but i also agree there are real nutters in the anti vx movement that do it a disservice
[19:41:02] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_ó<​ QU​ACK!
[19:41:07] <ThePendulum> vx being vaccinations? wat
[19:41:51] <skye0_mobile> zaggynl i think they should have delayed opening up until there were zero ACTIVE, not NEW cases
[19:41:51] <slothpaw> yea 
[19:42:02] <ThePendulum> are you saying they died despite being vaccinated or died because of the vaccination?
[19:42:12] <slothpaw> because of vax
[19:42:15] <brimstone> ,bef
[19:42:15] <unfinity> brimstone you befriended a duck in 73.566 seconds! You have made friends with 115 ducks in #datahoarder.
[19:42:15] <ThePendulum> because suggesting everyone knows someone that died because of the vaccination is shooting yourself in the foot
[19:42:16] <Emelie> ,bef
[19:42:16] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[19:42:31] <slothpaw> sorry i meant either sick or died
[19:42:53] <ThePendulum> I don't think hardly anyone knows someone that got even close to dying from the vaccination
[19:43:03] <slothpaw> actually thats what i did say 
[19:43:21] <ThePendulum> and getting sick for a day or two is something almost everyone expects
[19:43:29] <slothpaw> 16:09 <slothpaw> everyone heres knows someone who either died of got real sick
[19:43:37] <ketas> i said to one local antivaxxer that they are engaging in wrong fistfight, instead of punching their friends, they should attack virus
[19:43:55] <ketas> noone wrote anything after it
[19:44:24] <ThePendulum> right, to me that sentence means you're implying most likely at least some people here know someone that died from it
[19:45:06] <slothpaw> also part of the corporate technocratic agenda is to get us agruing and split 50/50 like they been doin long time while they profit from plantet/people rape 
[19:45:11] <ThePendulum> I'm sorry to hear 3 of your relations supposedly did, but that seems... ridiculously unlucky. by that same bad luck you would know over a hundred people that died in a plane crash
[19:46:09] <slothpaw> sorry pendulum thats just who it seems to me they were fine then weeks after taking vax they die
[19:46:10] <skye0_mobile> companies will always profit. we have to go anti-civ at this point. return to monke, as the meme says, but unironically
[19:46:46] <slothpaw> i have no ill feeling to anyone here who disagrees with me :)
[19:47:00] <slothpaw> i just want to say how it seems to me
[19:47:12] * joepie91 wanders in
[19:47:19] <slothpaw> i admit i could be wrong and in fact i hope i am about the whole thing
[19:47:31] <ThePendulum> one thing the people you're talking to can /definitely/ dispute is that they personally know someone that died from the vaccination, though
[19:51:09] <slothpaw> but with respect ThePendulum i never said that 
[19:51:18] <slothpaw> "who either died of got real sick" ^
[19:52:01] <ThePendulum> the fact you point it out implies at least some likelyhood that in a room of 300 people, a couple would know someone that died
[19:52:13] <ThePendulum> and you said you suspect 3 people you know personally indeed did
[19:52:43] <ThePendulum> billions of people have been vaccinated at this point, it would be absolute carnage if it was that common
[19:52:43] <slothpaw> i also live in a tight dense populated rural communitity which may have amplified the effect
[19:53:12] <slothpaw> well that is what they are predicting down the line
[19:53:23] <slothpaw> i might be the canary in the coal mine
[19:56:04] <ThePendulum> a bunch of people I know got sick for at most 2 days, my dad woke up mostly deaf for a couple hours but he's had meniere's and surgery for it, and they're all fine now. that's exactly within scope of what it says on the tin
[19:56:31] <slothpaw> but my own feeling is its not mass death they want its sickness as that means big pharma corporate profit
[19:56:53] <slothpaw> im really glad ur dads ok
[19:57:13] <slothpaw> i agree thats been the majority effect 
[19:57:36] <slothpaw> but i think ive seen enough to indicate a more disturbing future trend 
[19:58:15] <slothpaw> more boosters or never ending boosters every 6 months will have a cummulative inflammation effect
[19:58:17] <ThePendulum> people are plenty sick already, there was and is more than enough pharma can peddle without needing to resort to something quite this... drastic

[20:01:00] <Snuupy> I've also heard good things about fastmail
[20:01:31] <slothpaw> startmail also has encrypt option
[20:01:34] <Snuupy> personally I'm not yet convinced of making the switch to alternate providers tbh
[20:01:50] <Snuupy> I'm eyeing my options but nothing is convincing for me
[20:02:01] <skye0_mobile> Yeah Snuupy
[20:02:02] <Snuupy> so google continues to nom all my data
[20:02:03] <ThePendulum> think you'll be hard pressed finding a company that can ditch authoritive pressure like that 
[20:02:30] <skye0_mobile> ThePendulum I've been eyeing Mullvad VPN because of their unique mechanism but then again they control pretty much all of the few servers or something
[20:02:46] <ThePendulum> 18k people with an cumallover.me address, heh
[20:02:49] <Snuupy> the critique is: 1) their onion redirects to their https site which doesn't use onion routing (???) 2) their marketing isn't aligned with the reality of their service
[20:03:12] <ThePendulum> I use mullvad but they don't have email do they? 
[20:03:42] <brimstone> Snuupy: i think #2 is huge
[20:04:08] <Snuupy> so do a lot of people
[20:04:09] <skye0_mobile> ThePendulum that's right, they're a VPN service
[20:04:20] <skye0_mobile> Tutanota I think might be another good email alternative but IDK
[20:05:04] <brimstone> #1 doesn't seem true for me though, Snuupy
[20:06:07] <ThePendulum> even if I find an alternative to google it's going to take a decade changing my email address everywhere heh
[20:06:12] <Snuupy> same

[20:06:53] <cluelessperson> auto renaming, manual classification? etc?
[20:08:24] <ThePendulum> I wrote a whole porn site to help sort porn, other than that mainly command line tools, rdfind for deduping, pyrenamer for predictable patterns, tvnamer for shows

[20:12:43] <ThePendulum> I didn't write rdfind, meant just what I use
[20:12:45] <rmmh> one interesting new deduping method that I've started poking at is finding videos that are identical apart from metadata
[20:12:47] <rmmh> oh
[20:12:55] <skye0_mobile> i might have to head out and play vidya before something else starts to tick me off
[20:13:03] <rmmh> like a lot of people will add their dumb "RIPPED FROM THEWAREZ.SU" metadata to all the fields in an mp4
[20:13:07] <rmmh> and it's otherwise completely identical
[20:13:26] <rmmh> so my little trick is for f in **/*.mp4; do [[ -e "$f".h264hash ]] && continue; echo "$f"; ffmpeg -loglevel error -i "$f" -an -c copy -f h264 - | sha256sum > "$f".h264hash; done

[20:19:14] <cluelessperson> ThePendulum, Well, for auto renaming, that can mostly easily be done with music, movies, series.   For "random" stuff, the title doesn't really matter as much and I wouldn't really autorename those directories.

[23:21:42] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, reddit really is mostly lazy idiots.   I have trouble browsing because they often cannot realistically view even a single video faithfully.

[23:22:40] <cluelessperson> the company and its admins are just corrupt self interested idiots
[23:23:29] <cluelessperson> moderators aren't diverse enough and aren't punished or removed even when obviously breaking the law, rules, and just being power hungry assholes.

[23:24:00] <cluelessperson> users often just repost things in subreddits where they don't belong, making the sorting and definitions worthless.
[23:24:32] <cluelessperson> then there's the blatant content theft, karmawhoring, botting
[23:26:17] <skye0_mobile> cluelessperson i try to keep to a handful of subreddits because a lot of shit they say can piss me of
[23:26:20] <skye0_mobile> *off
[23:26:50] <skye0_mobile> reddit is problematic but i don't feel like i deserve to be on other social networks i prefer like tumblr
[23:27:02] <cluelessperson> and then reddit users that point out the hypocrisy, the corruption, or suggest unpopular views *within the rules* get banned by admins/mods stretching the rule's definitions.
[23:27:02] <skye0_mobile> and certain twitch streamers' communitiee

[23:27:44] <skye0_mobile> sorry for the late responses, i was playing bf4 and attending to zoom calls
[23:28:05] <skye0_mobile> i stick to certain interest based subs like battlefield
[23:28:30] <NiLon> I don't even use reddit because it doesn't work on mobile
[23:28:47] <cluelessperson> For example:  reddit's rules outline that you cannot witchhunt or specifically push for violence against anyone in particular.   I've seen them banning people left and right for suggesting "kill the rich",  which is a cultural idea, not   "Let's go to this asshole's house right now and burn it down"
[23:28:48] <skye0_mobile> yeah. i gave in but for a feeling of isolation i guess
[23:29:03] <skye0_mobile> yeah cluelessperson. hate that rule. a perfect example of bothsidesism
[23:29:18] <NiLon> each time you go read something it starts to whine that I need to download some app, negative good sir. I have an app already, the browser I'm using
[23:29:18] <skye0_mobile> got moderated once or twice for doing that
[23:29:44] <skye0_mobile> yeah NiLon, that's annoying. If you want, use teddit.net, an alternative frontend for Reddit if you just want to browse it without an account
[23:30:10] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, They banned for example /r/watchpeopledie, which is definitely pretty extreme content and on the edge of what I think is important to keep, but it wasn't celebrated.
[23:30:27] <skye0_mobile> yeah cluelessperson. they banned /r/shoplifting because of moderatism
[23:30:30] <NiLon> problem is that if I get reddit thread from search engine, it's not using teddit or something like that
[23:30:42] <NiLon> would need some sort of extension to translate those on the fly
[23:30:42] <skye0_mobile> i wouldn't want to go to /r/watchpeopledie personally though
[23:31:00] <skye0_mobile> and /r/morbidreality has shitty moderation IMO, overly strict IMO, and not comfortable for me to visit
[23:31:20] <skye0_mobile> NiLon I'm not sure if I understand, I'm sorry. I'm a bit drunk atm
[23:31:37] <cluelessperson> The entire subreddit operated with the understanding that:  "This is what happens if you do not take appropriate safety precautions"
[23:32:08] <skye0_mobile> cluelessperson i guess they wanted to look attractive to advertisers and investors. they're apparently owned right now by condé nast AFAIK
[23:32:14] <cluelessperson> I wouldn't suggest hanging out there, that would be unhealthy mentally, but occasionally looking to remind yourself not to speed or play around with lockout procedures on industrial equipment or with electricity is super important.
[23:32:48] <cluelessperson> and it's a perfect catalog to throw in the face of politicians that want to defund and gut OSHA.
[23:33:46] <skye0_mobile> i'd hope at least there's other places like it. /r/suicidenotes got banned too, but there's a website - https://rslashsuicidenotes.org/
[23:33:50] <skye0_mobile> ,get
[23:33:51] <unfinity> r/SuicideNotes
[23:34:09] <cluelessperson> Well, they banned that subreddit for what?  They didn't celebrate or suggest illegal activity.
[23:34:29] <cluelessperson>  /r/shoplifting was totally understandable to ban though.  It outright celebrated and suggested and aided you to commit crimes.
[23:34:31] <skye0_mobile> probably because it would have made people who weren't in the right head space commit suicide or whatever, idk
[23:34:50] <skye0_mobile> of course but i am sympathetic to those who disregard conventional politics
[23:35:18] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, well that's definitely going into the territory of "we're banning this because you can't decide for yourself what you can see"
[23:36:32] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, my favorite subs are:  /r/ImaginaryAstronauts /r/ImaginarySliceOfLife
[23:37:10] <skye0_mobile> i browse subs like /r/battlefield
[23:38:05] <cluelessperson> frankly, if you don't have places for people to discuss their very real problems, fears, and nightmares, it's just going to eat at them.
[23:38:20] <cluelessperson> but you certainly don't want just an echo-chamber of that.
[23:38:25] <cluelessperson> (which is the admins' doing)
[23:39:12] <skye0_mobile> to me admins are full of moderaters trying to look good to investors

[23:39:25] <unfinity> 04<cluelessperson> moderates aren't diverse enough and aren't punished or removed even when obviously breaking the law, rules, and just being power hungry assholes.

[23:40:42] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, Yeah, so investors are basically being given control over our media sources.
[23:41:09] <cluelessperson> Which is a huge reason I love datahoarding. :D
[23:41:22] <skye0_mobile> yup

[23:48:20] <cluelessperson> skye0_mobile, I recognize that *some* amount of IP makes sense, but for people to act like they built everything by themselves without standing on the shoulders of giants and mountains of long dead humans before them is just stupid.
[23:48:28] <cluelessperson> They are a part of our society, period.
[23:49:30] <skye0_mobile> i blame civilization for causing all this mess. can't call myself anarcho-primitivist though because i love tech too much. but yeah, i agree, people have borrowed ideas from others all the time. i can accept some compromise as long as it's only as restrictive as like creative commons
[23:49:59] <cirdan> the us used to have a great copyright. 7 years with a 7 extention. then it was 14+14... etc
