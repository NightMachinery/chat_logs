[00:10:06] <gordonfish> Had an interesting off-by-one-error by way of a phone scammer, who called our land line pretending to be from the power company's local office. Trouble is, the area code of the phone number they faked on the caller id was $mine + 1, which is an area code used on the other side of the country, about 2000 miles away.
[00:13:46] <gordonfish> To be clear, I double checked it the number on the caller id was just like the local office's number, with the area code + 1
[00:15:03] <laidback_01> only the aware pick up on stuff like that.  I recently helped an older woman NOT send her banking credentials to a hacker... she totally believed everything the hacker with teamviewer said... when I looked at the phishing email, I jsut could not believe she fell for it, but... whatever.  people are getting duped all the time anymore.
[00:15:38] <Grinnz> people being forced into technology they don't understand is really a huge problem
[00:16:07] <gordonfish> laidback_01: Nice catch
[00:16:22] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Indeed
[00:16:27] <laidback_01> lol, I love that comment.  It's how I feel about the vaccine.  absolutely the most advanced vaccine on the planet... yeah, I don't understand it and don't want to deal with it till I do
[00:17:23] <laidback_01> I know you were not likening the two and am not saying that, but that sentence sums up about how I feel on the subject.  I don't want to be forced into a technology I don't understand.  it's a problem.
[00:17:27] <Grinnz> no antivax propaganda in this channel, please.
[00:18:00] <laidback_01> ok, fair enough.  only the pro stuff

[00:18:28] <gordonfish> I don't think it's all that much about the vaccine itself, but the virus it is to treat, why so much info is obscured.
[00:20:26] * ether ಠ_ಠ
[00:21:56] <Grinnz> information isn't obscured. there's lots of it on the cdc website if you wish to inform yourself. and further this topic doesn't seem appropriate for this channel
[00:23:05] <gordonfish> I have, but there is a lot about this virus that isn't being shared with the general public.

[00:23:40] <Grinnz> enough
[00:25:10] <Adura> People get touchy about it.
[00:30:33] <laidback_01> so... I've written a useful to me item that generated HAProxy config files.  I work in a hospital setting, and we have just tons of the tcp interfaces that send EDI or HL7 data from one server to another.  I run them all through HAProxy because it allows me to manage it all easily.  backend changeouts and stuff.
[00:30:54] <vanfanel64> The blatant politization around it also does not help. Speaking as a democrat and from a family of life long die hards, it has handled it horrendously by them.
[00:31:32] <mst> *ENOUGH*
[00:32:01] <laidback_01> anyway, I wrote this in Catalyst about 8 months ago, it's working fine, but I'm finding I want to do some more stuff, dress it up, etc...  Now, I don't want yet another religious war.. but I get the feeling that Mojolicious might be a better fit for this.  I've been playing with it and learning a bit and it sure has a familiar feel to catalyst (to me)
[00:32:20] <Grinnz> this was not an invitation to continue talking around the edges of it
[00:32:30] <mst> if you're wanting to lean into websockets, Mojolicious is the logical choice
[00:32:42] <mst> for everything else, it generally doesn't make *that* much difference IME
[00:32:47] <laidback_01> the main thing - the amount of code I wrote is less than 1k lines
[00:33:02] <laidback_01> okay, so Mojolicious... it's NOT for the small projects?
[00:33:06] <mst> eh?
[00:33:18] <mst> cat and mojo both handle small and large projects fine
[00:33:20] <Grinnz> mojolicious is for any size project, but it's going to be a rewrite
[00:33:29] <Grinnz> some things will map from catalyst, some won't
[00:33:44] <Grinnz> so if you want to try it go for it
[00:33:46] <laidback_01> Oh.  okay, so I was under the wrong impression
[00:33:48] <mst> what I'm saying is specifically that mojo's being native async with a really good websocket API is the one obvious case where there's an obvious choice between the two
[00:33:57] <laidback_01> no, I don't want to do that just for doing it's sake.
[00:34:11] <mst> for everything else, I'm generally pretty comfortable in either
[00:34:15] <Grinnz> if catalyst is working fine for what yuo need then there's no reason to change
[00:34:17] <laidback_01> I thought I was going to make a better useful tool for myself.
[00:34:43] <mst> basically, the question is, what leads you to think one or the other would be a better fit?
[00:34:47] <laidback_01> okay, this is used by a single person, sometimes two or three simultaneous tabs, the UI sux, lol
[00:35:26] <Grinnz> that seems more like design choices that could be improved, than something mojo or catalyst would make a difference in
[00:35:49] <Grinnz> mojo gives you the flexibility to use websockets or async requests if you so choose, that's the main thing
[00:36:49] <laidback_01> I was reading the documentation around Mojo, and around Catalyst, and I've got several successful projects in Cat.  I'm a on again off again coder.  much of the time I'm working in javascript, sql, twice now erlang (what a trip that is!) and perl when I need to get something done fast.
[00:36:52] <Grinnz> and has some more flexibility in how you lay out your application components, but that may or may not matter to you
[00:37:21] <laidback_01> so... anyway, my reading led me to the belief (now corrected) that Mojo was for small/quick apps, Cat for the big stuff.
[00:37:51] <laidback_01> I'll leave well enough alone and focus on making a more useful UI.  thanks for the input.
[00:37:51] <Grinnz> mojo is for any size, catalyst tends to be "for big stuff" because all of the setup isn't generally worth it for small apps
[00:38:12] <Grinnz> but nothing restricting in either case

[00:48:52] <mst> keir: I think there's an overlap between programmers and sci-fi in general
[00:49:19] <laidback_01> star trek is popular because there's a lot of grey between right and wrong.  Python is more rigid in their ways, they prefer exactness, black and white, and hence the simplicity of Star Wars
[00:49:43] <laidback_01> okay, done with the ha ha stuff.

[00:50:13] <laidback_01> (I'm actually learning Python) and.. it's different, but I'm trying to get to be useful in it.
[00:50:24] <gordonfish> Python also has a lot of empty space
[00:50:29] <jabberwok> There's more than one way to (populate the galaxy with folks who look suspiciously like Captain Kirk)
[00:50:29] <mst> it's both very different and pretty much as capable as perl
[00:50:42] <keir> Python's stdlib is great though
[00:51:07] <mst> honestly, python's scoping model is my biggest objection to it
[00:51:14] <mst> everything else is either a matter of taste or a score draw
[00:51:44] * gordonfish almost read that as sore jaw
[00:52:01] <laidback_01> well, using R is really handy for a lot of my work. but  a lot of my peers use python, and well, it's an impedance mismatch
[00:52:25] <mst> gordonfish: "Alas poor Fellatio, I blew him well"
[00:52:36] <jabberwok> it's Ruby that boggles my mind writing :little_string instead of "little string" (why? why? why?)
[00:52:59] <keir> jabberwok: symbols are faster, as far as i understand it
[00:53:06] <LeoNerd> Oh, does Ruby have true atomic symbols?
[00:53:17] <gordonfish> I find ruby to be quite refractive
[00:53:35] <jabberwok> keir: perhaps but I file that under "premature optimization"
[00:53:57] <Grinnz> seems like something the parser should do for you?
[00:54:27] <mst> distinguishing symbols and strings has non-optimisation advantages IIRC
[00:54:30] <LeoNerd> Not quite. At least, not if done the way Scheme's ones work
[00:54:35] <laidback_01> any of you play with Erlang?  I've gotten a taste of it now...  I'm wanting to work with it more, but that couldn't be more different
[00:54:49] <LeoNerd> a symbol is distinct from any string, which has obvious "code injection / security" benefits to it
[00:55:12] <Grinnz> i read "instead of" as "equivalent to"
[00:55:22] <Grinnz> is it not?
[00:55:38] <LeoNerd> Well I don't know Ruby. I'm commenting on Scheme
[00:58:23] <jabberwok> perhaps i have an odd perspective as my first languages in order were CHIP-8, 1802 (hand-)assembler, trs80 basic, fortran (on punch cards into a pdp-11/45), basic-plus/2, forth, pascal and then C
[00:59:32] * choroba needs some Erlang for work
[01:01:44] <mst> Grinnz: having an arbitrary string as a key works fine in ruby
[01:02:06] <mst> Grinnz: however for things where it's a specific identifier, generally people use a specific identifier rather than a string with the same characters in it
[01:02:33] <gordonfish> jabberwok: My only issue with punch cards is the potential for paper cuts.
[01:03:16] <mst> solution: don't stick your dick in the punch cards

[07:42:03] <cmburn> a lot of examples for keys within the hash for a new class object function have a _ before them, i.e. my $self = { _foo => "bar,  }, is that considered best practice
[07:42:06] <cmburn> ?
[07:43:15] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:45:48] <Grinnz> cmburn: not particularly. it's a convention for two things: 1. private attributes, 2. a "private" component of a public attribute
[07:46:12] <Grinnz> some object setups use the latter for all attributes and so they end up with all underscore keys
[07:46:20] <Grinnz> but this is kinda rare, most just match the attribute name
[07:47:29] <Grinnz> best practice is to use an object system like Moo so you don't need to write this boilerplate in the first place
[07:49:02] *** Quits: madduck (~madduck@user/madduck) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:49:38] <cmburn> eh fair enough, codebase is always this far without using external libs, just trying to tidy up
[07:49:42] <cmburn> appreciate it!
[07:51:09] <Grinnz> hopefully in the not too distant future there will be an object system that looks vaguely like https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad in core perl
[07:51:09] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Object::Pad - a simple syntax for lexical slot-based objects - metacpan.org ]
[07:51:57] <Grinnz> but for the time being, Moo is light on deps and light on overhead for most use cases
[07:52:49] <Grinnz> there are also lighter like Mojo::Base and Class::Tiny if you don't need features

[08:32:18] <BSaboia> rewt, thanks
[08:34:32] <BSaboia> Well, it seems that taint is not helping me there. From what I read, it restringes the use of env vars, and my script needs them
[08:36:03] <Grinnz> yes, that's a major reason why taint mode creates non-useful problems
[08:37:12] <Grinnz> it's only really useful for two cases: CGI scripts, where your script's inputs are all env vars; and setuid scripts, because they run with elevated permissions
[08:37:25] <Grinnz> neither of those things are things you should write anymore

[16:35:14] <simcop2387> i'd like to preface all of our advice with: it's all down to office politics, you might not be able to negotiate even if you're right.
[16:35:56] <simcop2387> that said, the specific situation will dictate a lot of it so the info you can provide on it is definitely useful for providing advice

[16:36:29] <The_Blode_> Thank you simcop2387

[16:37:20] <The_Blode_> My point was, there's no need to put the empty condition in the code, it's redundant as the $name variable always has a value. It can never be empty.
[16:37:56] <The_Blode_> I may be being too literal with this though
[16:40:04] <simcop2387> The_Blode_: for that specific bit of code, you'd definitely be right.  in real code though i might still have that check and a warning of some kind as part of the else for it.  the reason being that the previous code that forces it to always have a value is going to get changed and i'd want the warning to get triggered when that's changed.
[16:42:02] <The_Blode_> Understood
[16:42:16] <The_Blode_> There's no detriment to the system if we have the condition I guess right?
[16:42:23] <The_Blode_> It's added code but has no real world impact
[16:42:28] <simcop2387> in some other languages (Rust, ML, Haskell, etc.) you can set things up where the compiler can prove that it's always the case and i'd be willing to say you don't need that kind of check because it'll be explicit from the type system and the compiler can check it.  but sadly perl doesn't have anything to do that (or a static analyzer of any consequence that can do it)
[16:43:03] <The_Blode_> Understood thanks for your input simcop2387  it's appreciated
[16:43:08] <simcop2387> there'll be a very tiny amount of overhead for doing the actual check but unless it's part of a really tight loop or performance sensitive code it won't matter in any reasonable fashion\

[16:52:12] <The_Blode_> There were more issues like using a foreach loop but inside the loop, they were using C style for loop counters
[16:52:26] <The_Blode_> Well, defeats the point of using foreach if you never use the pointers right?
[16:53:45] <simcop2387> there are times where you need to do that even in perl, particularly when you're altering the thing you're iterating over.  i.e. removing elements with splice() from an array.  it's doable without c style loops but it can be easier to follow if you're using them sometimes.
[16:54:38] <The_Blode_> Good point
[16:58:00] <simcop2387> usually though if i find i'm in that kind of situation it usually means i've got the wrong data structure to begin with though and i can do a better job of it another way.  though that isn't always obvious what that better way is.	sometimes you just have to do something weird, like i've got for an update to the evalserver code, where i want to do a partial sort rather than a complete one because
[16:58:06] <simcop2387> doing a complete one constantly means that i do a bunch of extra work that doesn't need to happen (in this case, bumping up scheduled jobs based on sessions, priority and deadlines)

[17:15:31] <ilmari> jose1711: 1) don't have the shell interpolate it, use single quotess around the perl code and $ENV{var} to access it
[17:15:53] <ilmari> jose1711: 2) use \Q to escape interpolated strings in regexes
[17:16:18] <ilmari> i.e. var="/mount/point" perl -e 'do_something() if /\Q$ENV{var}/'
[17:16:37] <ilmari> (\E to stop the escaping, if there's other stuff after it in the regex)
[17:17:13] <jose1711> what if i don't want to export the var
[17:17:17] <jose1711> or.. maybe i do?
[17:17:42] <ilmari> you do
[17:17:51] <jose1711> all right. thank you, gonna test
[17:18:20] <ilmari> (or as in my example, just specify it for the invocation of perl, rather than ambiently in the shell)

[19:00:00] <The_Blode_> Hey Perlites, me again. Just noticing something again in code review. If we declare my @array = ""; Then we do foreach (@array) we will iterate through the loop once every time even if array is empty.
[19:00:08] <The_Blode_> Is this because we have initialised the array right?
[19:00:19] <huf> but it isnt empty
[19:00:23] <huf> it's got one empty string in it
[19:00:29] <huf> my @array; is already empty
[19:00:52] <The_Blode_> Understood so position 0 has an empty string
[19:00:53] <huf> my @array = ""; is my @array = (""); is my @array; $array[0] = "";
[19:01:02] <huf> so yeah, that's an instant code smell
[19:01:09] <The_Blode_> Understood. Thanks for confirming huf :)
[19:01:16] <huf> usually a sign of someone not knowing perl, unless it's a brainfart

[19:07:45] <The_Blode_> Now I know this isn't optimal.
[19:07:56] <The_Blode_> Maybe @array = ();
[19:08:00] <huf> nah
[19:08:03] <simcop2387> ok i think it's all configured... lets go swap switches and see how broken it is.  perlbot and i will be offline during the change over
[19:08:03] <The_Blode_> Well, just my @array;
[19:08:07] <huf> if you want it empty, just .. yeah

[19:08:33] <The_Blode_> I shouldn't be using scalars

[19:11:29] <guavahabanero> Hello! I have been handed a perl web app with errors and I am not a perl developer so I have a couple questions that I would really appreciate some help on as 2 hours of Google haven't gotten me anywhere.
[19:11:33] <simcop2387> that way you can leave logging/debugging in and only have it matter when there's an error
[19:11:42] <mst> guavahabanero: read /topic for how to show code and errors please.
[19:11:44] <simcop2387> guavahabanero: ask away, that's what we do here
[19:11:46] <The_Blode_> guavahabanero: you're in the right place
[19:11:54] <guavahabanero> Running 'perl -c' on a .pm file gives me the error "Can't locate Assert.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Assert module)"
[19:12:12] <guavahabanero> cpan can't find anything besides Carp::Assert which doesn't fix the problem
[19:12:41] <guavahabanero> I feel like I'm missing something obvious but can't figure it out. I don't mind doing the reading myself if even just relevant search terms could be provided
[19:12:49] <guavahabanero> And thank you both for being kind and welcoming!
[19:12:51] <simcop2387> guavahabanero: that's likely a module specific to the webapp.  look for a file inside it named Assert.pm
[19:13:09] <simcop2387> you might need to do: perl -I/path/to/webapp/ -c File.pm
[19:13:27] <mst> guavahabanero: if you told us the -actual- 'perl -c' command that would help
[19:13:51] <mst> guavahabanero: please remember the more details you provide the faster we can help, that's why I told you to read /topic so you can paste complete command, complete code and complete errors
[19:14:08] <mst> guavahabanero: *describing* the error like you just did while leaving 90% of the information out will only make everything slower :)
[19:14:31] <guavahabanero> Thank you! Find has located the file so I'll try the -I flag first

[19:15:19] <guavahabanero> That helped! I have new errors but seem to be about a specific file so this has already been a huge help!
[19:15:22] <guavahabanero> Thank you!
[19:15:25] <mst> also btw 'perl -c' is fairly pointless on modules
[19:15:34] <mst> you're better off doing something like 'perl -Ilib lib/Foo/Bar.pm'
[19:15:40] <mst> since you want to check the module fully loads
[19:15:42] <guavahabanero> I will stick around incase something else pops up
[19:15:53] <mst> the only reason for the -c flag for testing is if it's a *script* so you don't want to make it do stuff

[19:16:31] <guavahabanero> And thank you. I have very little experience with perl (c developer in my daily life) so I genuinely appreciate the help
[19:17:59] <mst> guavahabanero: oh! also, you can '-Mdiagnostics' while will do the moral equivalent of running the perl-core-provided 'splain' script on your warnings and errors (you can also look them up in the perldiag man page)
[19:18:30] <mst> basically that gives you verbose mode for anything the core perl language is sending to stderr while complaining about your code
[19:18:35] <mst> very helpful when you're relatively new
[19:19:19] <guavahabanero> Thank you!
[19:19:40] <guavahabanero> I think the problem is now it just can't find the core webapp module which *should* be solveable

[19:21:00] <guavahabanero> If my directory listing contains lib/TWiki and I'm getting an error on lines containing use TWiki;, this should just be a case of setting a path somewhere to include that directory?
[19:21:15] <mst> the -I you already added should have fixed that
[19:21:31] <mst> if you think you need more than one -I (or 'use lib' in the code or PERL5LIB= in the env) then you really should be giving us some actual details so we can figure out which of the possible situations it is
[19:22:00] <mst> I did already say 'perl -Ilib' after all, so lib/TWiki.pm should be loaded by 'use TWiki' just fine.
[19:22:21] <guavahabanero> I'd love to but the file paths and so on contain site-specific information and I'm not sure if I can disclose that

[19:58:53] <haj1> Ah, ok
[19:58:58] <guavahabanero> I do have one question though. The installation guide says "Run the configure script from your browser (enter http://yourdomain/do/configure into your browser address bar)"
[19:59:12] <guavahabanero> Do you know where this /do/ comes from?
[19:59:16] <haj1> Yes
[19:59:32] <haj1> That's the convention how CGI paths have been written on twiki.org
[19:59:45] <guavahabanero> so do I just swap that with /bin/?
[19:59:47] <haj1> Replace that with the address you got from your provider
[19:59:57] <mst> so /do/ means /your/cgi-bin/or/wherever/also/fuck/you
[19:59:59] <mst> marvelous.
[20:00:30] <guavahabanero> Oh christ. This doesn't need to be in a cgi-bin folder does it?

[23:47:10] <gordonfish> mst: I don't recall the C# compiler coming preinstalled (or enable-able in programs and features) on Windows, just WSH, unless I've missed something. I know it's always been prominent in visual studio since 2003-ish though.
[23:48:23] <buZz> i think win95 was the last OS that microsoft shipped which included a programming language
[23:48:30] <buZz> (qbasic.exe in the included msdos 7.0)
[23:48:48] <gordonfish> mst: My biggest issues with running into it at on a web server I'm asked to debug is often there is no source code, just the binaries, so I can't just open the program in an editor check/test stuff.
[23:48:58] <buZz> well, unless you call cmd.exe a programming language i guess :P
[23:49:02] <gordonfish> buZz: Yeah qbasic
[23:51:58] <gordonfish> buZz: Technically batch is a scripting language, like most any shell, just a bit more basic, where you gotta implement things your self that the likes of bash and others have had for years.
[23:52:27] <dextercd> windows also ships with powershell, vbscript and jscript
[23:52:32] <gordonfish> I remember a good while back I wrote my own 'array' emmulating code, that would use variables like 'somename[3]' and such, handled by CALL functions and such. This was because variable name could have practically any character in them, unless bash and such.
[23:52:50] <buZz> dextercd: yeah winnt , since last ..3? versions
[23:53:02] <buZz> thats all scripting yeah

[23:57:56] <dextercd> Powershell also includes 'Add-Type' which you pass C# code to. Can even generate console applications using that it seems
