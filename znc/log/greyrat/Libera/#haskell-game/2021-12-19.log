[01:41:44] <EvanR> sm, talk about rabbit hole... if a paddle is close to a wall, doesn't matter how small the ball is... it could strike the paddle and wall at the same time. Which corresponds to a micro cusp between a circle and a line
[01:42:42] <sm> yeah! general handling for arbitrary number of simultaneous collision points required :)
[01:43:30] <EvanR> an inside corner turned out to be easy, because if you compose two reflections, the fact that the normals are at 90 means a term cancells and it's commutative xD
[01:44:00] <EvanR> a corner with a sharper angle allows more reflections and they are order dependent
[01:45:14] <EvanR> this is crazy
[01:48:27] <EvanR> also the right order then depends on details of where the particle comes in and not just the angle
[01:51:53] <sm> perhaps: if you handle two simultaneous contact points, more of them does not change the outcome
[01:52:10] <sm> no.. it does..
[01:52:23] <EvanR> where does 3 happen
[01:52:28] <EvanR> I'm still boggling at 2
[01:52:52] <sm> I'm just imagining arbitrary jagged landscape
[01:53:28] <sm> it's more likely with small bricks and a large ball
[01:54:02] <EvanR> here's how I'm thinking of it, you are a ball right. If you think of your position as just being the center, then the effective surface you hit is the union of all the surfaces with a buffer zone of r away
[01:54:26] <EvanR> in this case you only ever hit isolated weird points corresponding to where the other objects cross 
[01:54:50] <EvanR> so a place where a ball could hit 3 things at once is similar to 2
[01:54:57] <EvanR> equally weird
[01:55:14] <EvanR> the surface the "center particle" hits would not be smooth
[01:55:27] <EvanR> that corresponds to multiple objects hitting the ball at once
[01:55:33] <sm> the shape/direction of the contact points matters I think ?
[01:55:56] <EvanR> the trajectory of the ball matters
[01:56:23] *** Joins: harrow (~harrow@static.38.6.217.95.clients.your-server.de)
[01:56:31] <EvanR> what it's supposed to do at this non-smooth point is somewhat customizable
[01:57:01] <EvanR> as long as the ball leaves the area through a "good window", at least it won't crash
[01:57:22] <EvanR> in the case of a circle exactly touching a line, there is no good window though
[01:57:30] <EvanR> it's zero degrees wide
[01:57:49] <EvanR> that corresponds to a paddle 1 ball diameter away from the wall
[01:57:51] <ManofLetters[m]> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWFkBabUYAEO8L_.jpg
[01:58:01] <sm> Man of Letters: what's the recommended terminal size for running Allure ?
[01:59:14] <sm> oh I forgot it makes a window, nm
[01:59:16] <ManofLetters[m]> anything above or at 80x45
[01:59:35] <ManofLetters[m]> with --frontendANSI it doesn't, but you don't get proportional fonts

[02:04:37] <f-a> why are you going for smoothness EvanR 
[02:04:46] <f-a> ar float themselves even smooth?
[02:06:44] <EvanR> the geometric scheme I'm using doesn't depend on floats specifically
[02:07:01] <EvanR> i could use rational, fixed point, creal, ...
[02:07:37] <EvanR> I'd like to eventually prove it
[02:07:53] <f-a> why are you overgeneralising
[02:08:07] <f-a> Plato went from objects to Ideas
[02:08:38] <f-a> you can follow a similar path and first make a working example and then generalise it in an enginethingo if the need arises
[02:08:50] <EvanR> if you don't like how floats work, better not rely on their details xD
[02:09:19] <f-a> I do not like how float works
[02:09:25] <f-a> > -0 == 0
[02:09:33] <f-a> gah where is lambdabot
[02:09:46] <EvanR> what's funny is I have a type for my geometry database to tell me what an Element is associated with

[02:10:01] <f-a> True
[02:10:01] <f-a> Œª> recip (-0) == recip 0
[02:10:01] <f-a> False
[02:10:05] <EvanR> data Platonic = Paddle | Wall | Block Int Int | Abyss
[02:10:19] <f-a> excellent naming
[02:10:37] <sm> no no no f-a we can't possibly make breakout until the Bouncing Problem is solved
[02:11:32] <EvanR> I'm glad it came up, it seems I can solve it in the same framework
[02:11:49] <sm> I wonder how well physics libraries handle this
[02:12:19] <EvanR> yeah... considering they can't know anything about what you're trying to do
[02:15:43] <EvanR> that recip non congruence is pretty funny

[02:19:10] <f-a> there should be an EqForReal typeclass
[02:20:13] <sm> I beat gauntlet! That's the furthest I've got into actual gameplay

[02:24:19] <sm> I know, I'm usually a flood of complaints :)
[02:24:21] <f-a> first I need to apt-get install allure it
[02:25:08] <f-a> lol it is Allure with a capital ‚ÄòA‚Äô
[02:25:11] <f-a> (to run it
[02:25:12] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: the version on Debian is like 5 numbers back
[02:25:37] <f-a> https://sun9-50.userapi.com/impg/F_6Z-6-PamNoAkB6ioiFqW1So9g8_lBbqDFHKQ/oPxxabXM__0.jpg?size=904x1280&quality=96&sign=4ad7a89292eb521b3ae6b5e60c9a7533&type=album
[02:25:51] <ManofLetters[m]> precisely :D
[02:26:34] <f-a> cabal get allure it will be then
[02:27:09] <ManofLetters[m]> `cabal update; cabal run Allure` should probably work
[02:27:29] <f-a> why did you and QuickCheck choose a capitalised name

[02:28:27] <ManofLetters[m]> I actually took over LambdaHack and then imitated it with Allure

[02:28:30] <f-a> y
[02:28:33] <ManofLetters[m]> no!
[02:28:33] <f-a> yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[02:28:37] <ManofLetters[m]> cancel it
[02:29:15] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/paste2069133-0
[02:29:57] <ManofLetters[m]> copy this file and lens won't be used: https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/cabal.project
[02:30:36] <ManofLetters[m]> though I'm not exactly sure if cabal would pick it up if you are not compiling from local codebase
[02:30:54] <f-a> can I just git clone?
[02:31:05] <ManofLetters[m]> perhaps you need to do `cabal install --project-file=cabal.project Allure`
[02:31:10] <sm> aha, the exciting cabal solver at work, adding zest to every build !
[02:31:49] <sm> I suppose the linux binary doesn't work for you f-a ?
[02:31:56] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: yes, you can clone and then the cabal.project would be used automatically, but perhaps the tweak above is enough withot cloning
[02:32:02] <f-a> oh. did not know there was a linux binary
[02:32:24] <f-a> no kmettverse this time \o/
[02:32:42] <ManofLetters[m]> with `--project-file=cabal.project` or with binary?
[02:32:49] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm curious if it would work
[02:33:24] <f-a> with cloning git repo
[02:33:40] <sm> Man of Letters: the helpful hints were nice and their distinct colour worked well
[02:33:40] <ManofLetters[m]> @sm: sure, cabal solver is fun, you can tell it not to use a package, say, lens, and it will cope (sometimes)
[02:33:53] <ManofLetters[m]> @f-a, oh, ok
[02:34:26] <f-a> a healty dose of copium is needed to compile, yeah
[02:34:30] <sm> "Rule out giant octopus on initial levels to teach simple tactics better" lol
[02:35:12] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah, octopus is obnoxious, it can predict your tricks, so the newbie doesn't learn them, even though on all other enemies they work
[02:36:55] <sm> also, seeing the mouse cursor reminded me to use mouse in menus
[02:37:15] <ManofLetters[m]> \o/
[02:38:00] <ManofLetters[m]> sm: that was a good idea of yours
[02:38:08] <ManofLetters[m]> BTW, is the mouse cursor (the crosshair) elongated for any of you? or a perfect circle as it should be
[02:38:24] <ManofLetters[m]> on my windows the height is larger than width
[02:39:32] <sm> it looks nicely symmetrical here on mac
[02:39:45] <f-a> people should not use the m*use
[02:39:54] <sm> I see an interesting warning dialog when I move the game from one screen to another
[02:40:11] * sm uploaded an image: (28KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mkFxmaQUZwLGOlfdFhyBFyLy/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-18%20at%201.10.02%20PM.png >
[02:40:33] <ManofLetters[m]> and do you really try to resize or fullscreen it?
[02:40:43] <sm> so I just ok'd it
[02:40:55] <sm> the game looks as before
[02:41:07] <f-a> looks suspiciously like that ¬´drink your verification can¬ª meme
[02:41:09] <ManofLetters[m]> so perhaps the OS is doing that, under the hood, even though the resize scale is 1
[02:41:38] <sm> it knows it's a game so I think it's maybe SDL not macos
[02:41:43] <ManofLetters[m]> I don't think I can detect it was resized to the same size
[02:42:01] <sm> though, SDL shouldn't assume "game" either..
[02:42:08] <ManofLetters[m]> there is no warning on Linux nor Windows from my experience
[02:42:38] <ManofLetters[m]> no, no, it's my own warning
[02:42:50] <ManofLetters[m]> but it's supposed to fire only at resize
[02:43:03] <sm> ah ok
[02:43:18] <sm> well these screens have different resolutions. The game looks fine in either one though.
[02:43:27] <ManofLetters[m]> so perhaps your OS, when it moves windows to another screen, resizes them
[02:43:33] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, ok
[02:43:47] <sm> perhaps. The laptop screen is retina
[02:44:43] <ManofLetters[m]> I see; so for ideal results, one should not move between screens on MacOs and start on retina with manual scaling tweaks
[02:45:05] <ManofLetters[m]> unless it stars on retina scaled already
[02:45:10] <ManofLetters[m]> *starts
[02:45:33] <ManofLetters[m]> I have no idea how to detect if the OS is going to auto-scale at startup
[02:45:53] <ManofLetters[m]> and there is a ticket to scale using C-+ and C-- instead of config file
[02:46:40] <ManofLetters[m]> for scalable fonts it really matters
[02:47:37] <EvanR> how long have you been working on allure
[02:48:03] <ManofLetters[m]> so far, decade or so
[02:48:12] <EvanR> dang
[02:48:13] <ManofLetters[m]> but I'm getting up to speed
[02:48:17] <sm> have you tracked hours ? we could have a guessing competition
[02:48:28] <ManofLetters[m]> haha, no I didn't
[02:48:39] <sm> pity!
[02:48:51] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm multiplexing too much
[02:48:53] <sm> still, you could estimate
[02:48:57] * sm guesses...
[02:49:57] <sm> 1500 hours
[02:50:08] <sm> no, 1000
[02:50:36] <ManofLetters[m]> that would be 2 commits per hour
[02:51:12] <f-a> there is nothing you can do about it, a good rl requires dedicated effort for a long period of time
[02:51:35] <f-a> the magic of multiple layers of interactions and emergent gameplay does not happen otherwise
[02:52:15] <EvanR> R L ?
[02:52:19] <f-a> roguelike
[02:52:44] <ManofLetters[m]> I think playtesting, balancing and releases took a long time, but most of all refactoring, so perhaps 2h per commit is plausible, so that would be 4000h
[02:53:47] <ManofLetters[m]> I have just a few code lines per commit and it will get lower still
[02:54:00] <ManofLetters[m]> both from refactoring and from balancing commits
[02:55:52] <sm> interesting.. what estimate do you get from (how many hours did I spend in a typical week * num weeks) ?
[03:02:06] <ManofLetters[m]> 40 weeks per year spent on the game (12 more weeks of the year on vacation or other hiatus) * 10 years * 1 h per week = 400h
[03:02:46] <ManofLetters[m]> so apparently I was spending more time per week that I thing or I devoted less time to the game total than I think
[03:04:51] <sm> only 1h / week average ? that'd be a pretty good low impact side project.. I was guessing more than that
[03:05:09] <sm> some weeks probably lots and some non at all I guess
[03:06:00] <ManofLetters[m]> github suggests for this year 10 commits per week on average, which is 20h by my measure
[03:06:22] <ManofLetters[m]> but there were years I was spending less than 1h per week, not counting vacation, etc.
[03:07:32] <ManofLetters[m]> so that's probaly 4 solid years * 50 weeks * 20h per week = 4000h
[03:07:45] <ManofLetters[m]> 1h turns out to be a bad average of 20h and 0h
[03:07:50] <ManofLetters[m]> who would have thought
[03:08:15] <ManofLetters[m]> and 6 years barely any work
[03:08:23] <ManofLetters[m]> or perhaps 8 solid half-years
[03:08:30] <ManofLetters[m]> and nothing in-between
[03:09:35] <sm> for comparison, I looked at my hledger numbers and it seems like about 6000h over 15 years, average of 8h/week
[03:10:01] <f-a> that is super
[03:10:23] <f-a> we should have a ¬´money saved on crap like starbucks¬ª hledger metric
[03:10:34] <sm> great idea
[03:10:38] <f-a> like, a global-hledger-users one

[03:15:30] <ManofLetters[m]> it says "cabal run --project-file=cabal.project.LH.dir"
[03:15:33] <f-a> thanks! I should have read before complainign
[03:16:12] <ManofLetters[m]> or only clone Allure and I think then it should work fine
[03:16:25] <ManofLetters[m]> and it would take LambdaHack from Hackage
[03:16:37] <ManofLetters[m]> no
[03:16:44] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, you'd need `cp cabal.project.local.development cabal.project.local`
[03:17:16] <ManofLetters[m]> no
[03:17:19] <ManofLetters[m]> argh
[03:17:31] <ManofLetters[m]> @f-a: did you have clone LambdaHack as well?
[03:19:17] <f-a> only this  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure
[03:19:34] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: ok, thanks and what which command exactly caused the error?
[03:19:40] <ManofLetters[m]> and `cabal --version`

[03:21:32] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm just compiling to check
[03:21:45] <ManofLetters[m]> that case is not handled in README
[03:21:58] <ManofLetters[m]> it assumes you also clone LambdaHack

[03:22:38] <f-a> an interesting setup
[03:23:40] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, got the same rror
[03:23:52] <ManofLetters[m]> thank you for the report, I will try to fix it
[03:24:12] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: yeah, it's a game engine and a game
[03:24:22] <ManofLetters[m]> and, so far, the game engine is not general enough
[03:24:29] <ManofLetters[m]> so it's assumed you'd also modify the engine
[03:24:31] <ManofLetters[m]> and so clone both
[03:25:01] <ManofLetters[m]> so, the binary finally worked for you?
[03:25:11] <f-a> it did

[03:34:12] <ManofLetters[m]> LambdaHack is already on Stackage
[03:34:22] <sm> it's your call whether to maintain a stack yaml (or several), but when I see one it always gives me confidence that I'll be able to build the project now and in future
[03:34:33] <f-a> tutorial is vry well done
[03:34:49] <sm> and (the above aside), it's usually a more reliable/simpler build command than with cabal
[03:35:43] <ManofLetters[m]> would this work?... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/6d17ae68f474429d12f1e2f6498eed4f1f040077)
[03:36:05] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: thank you kindly
[03:36:27] <sm> I can try later if you like. That'll be ghc 9.0.1. You need to mention . under packages:.
[03:36:28] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, do you mean tutorial levels, tutorial messages or the manual document?
[03:36:51] <sm> afk now, heading down the mountain - later! o/
[03:37:15] <ManofLetters[m]> @sm: see you!
[03:40:57] <f-a> mountain?
[03:40:59] <ManofLetters[m]> doh, my install instructions are rubbish; `cabal run Allure` doesn't work outside of any package directory; I should have known
[03:42:38] <f-a> who would run it outside of package directory?
[03:42:43] <f-a> oh you mean from hackage?
[03:42:52] <f-a> cabal install Allure && Allure
[03:42:53] <ManofLetters[m]> yes
[03:43:01] <ManofLetters[m]> yep, that works
[03:43:03] <f-a> if you have ~/.cabal/bin in your path
[03:43:13] <sm> /msg f-a since april I live on the side of the volcano üåã Haleakala
[03:43:15] <ManofLetters[m]> but my README tells otherwise :)
[03:43:23] <ManofLetters[m]> wooow
[03:43:39] <ManofLetters[m]> Hawai?
[03:44:02] <sm> ü§ô
[03:44:37] <sm> I'm in HST yup
[03:44:38] <f-a> can I send you a letter there?
[03:44:52] <f-a> I feel it will take even longer than when I send it to Australia
[03:44:58] <f-a> very nice move sm 
[03:45:01] <f-a> I hope you are happy
[03:45:02] <f-a> and
[03:45:02] <f-a> uhh
[03:45:09] <f-a> the volcano does not pull a Pompei
[03:45:24] <f-a> I will write an euology just in case.
[03:47:22] <sm> thanks! it's far from home but awesome

[04:56:12] <sm> bah EvanR I will haunt you
[05:06:08] <ManofLetters[m]> sm: I pushed the new stack.yaml, together with the fix for the compilation failure (and bogus README `cabal run` instructions)
[05:06:47] <ManofLetters[m]> I mean, if you turn out alive after all
[06:59:07] <sm> that looks good. I don't have ghc 9 (arm) on this machine yet so I'll stick with my stack810.yaml for now
[09:57:56] <sm> https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer seems to be increasingly working cross platform
[09:58:48] <sm> has some kind of support for arbitrary opengl rendering, https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer/blob/main/docs/examples/05-opengl.md

[16:23:53] <f-a> ManofLetters[m]: do we *need* that ¬´please resize the game etc etc¬ª popup at gamestart?
[16:32:20] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: no, that sounds like a bug; I don't get it at restart (Ubuntu, also tested on Windows 10)
[16:32:38] <ManofLetters[m]> perhaps your OS tries to resize it somehow?
[16:33:31] <ManofLetters[m]> what OS is that?
[16:34:19] <ManofLetters[m]> I think sm gets it only when moving the window to another screen with retina display (at which point it's probably auto-resized by OS, because I don't know how to tell OS not to do it)
[16:41:45] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: you can try to set it to fullscreen and change scale in the config file, as guided in the comments of the config file; perhaps then it won't complain
[16:44:24] <ManofLetters[m]> huh, apparently there is a setting for that, but they don't say what's the default: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_SetWindowResizable
[16:45:17] <ManofLetters[m]> Haskell docs are more helpful and say "defaults to False": https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2-2.5.3.0/docs/SDL-Video.html#v:windowResizable
[16:45:29] <ManofLetters[m]> so your OS must be ignoring the hint
[16:46:38] <ManofLetters[m]> there is also `windowHighDPI`; I wonder if that would prevent the resizing that sm is experiencing...
[16:47:23] <f-a> debian stable, I use xmonad, the window is floating
[16:52:11] <ManofLetters[m]> and it doesn't change size, but still complains?
[16:52:45] <ManofLetters[m]> can you resize it with mouse?
[16:55:25] <ManofLetters[m]> I've removed the warning and pushed
[16:55:40] <ManofLetters[m]> just recompile
[16:55:45] <f-a> ah, I was going to record with obs, but let us see if it works
[16:56:16] <f-a> one sec
[16:56:22] <ManofLetters[m]> but you need to recompile LambdaHack as well
[16:56:27] <f-a> apparently oh
[16:57:07] <ManofLetters[m]> in Allure/ do `cp cabal.project.LH.dir cabal.project`
[16:57:15] <f-a> another thing I wanted to say but I need to replay it to be sure is that maybe init screen was a bit confusing and I would have preferred a ¬´pres ‚Äòt‚Äô for tutorial¬ª or something
[16:57:20] <ManofLetters[m]> have LambdaHack/ at the same level in directory hierarchy as Allure
[16:57:27] <ManofLetters[m]> and in Allure do `cabal install`
[16:57:57] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: cool, please do record such feedback so that it doesn't vanish; it's extremely precious
[16:58:07] <f-a> but let me play more first
[16:58:12] <ManofLetters[m]> :D
[16:58:32] <ManofLetters[m]> you have recompilation instructions ^^^
[16:58:52] <ManofLetters[m]> (those in README are for dev build, which is -O0, so can be a bit laggy)
[16:59:40] <ManofLetters[m]> BTW, what is "obs" in "I was going to record with obs"
[17:01:56] <f-a> OBS is obs studio
[17:02:00] <f-a>        obs (OBS Studio) provides efficient recording and streaming of live video content. It supports live RTP streaming to various streaming sites.
[17:02:25] <f-a> learn it so you can livestream yourself playing AoS
[17:02:31] <f-a> or livecoding.
[17:05:21] <ManofLetters[m]> ooh, shiny
[17:09:35] <ManofLetters[m]> I've added the warning, because somebody (possibly also with xmonad) actually manage to force-fullscreen the game via fullscreen window decoration button (which should not be there!) and it totally broke aspect ration, making distances on the map wrong, and of course breaking anti-aliasing of all fonts and distorting them
[17:09:54] <ManofLetters[m]> s/manage/managed/, s/ration/ratio/
[17:10:55] <ManofLetters[m]> but I'd rather let naughty window managers break stuff than punish innocent players with spam
[17:17:40] <f-a> a good wm should spam the window as non-anchored
[17:18:14] <f-a> if someone pushes ‚åÇ+t or whatever to anchor it or make it fullscreen, it frankly is their fault, but I understand your reasoning
[17:19:01] <ManofLetters[m]> what is non-anchored?
[17:19:11] <f-a> free floating window
[17:19:17] <f-a> I do not know the correct lingo
[17:19:22] <ManofLetters[m]> is that bad?
[17:19:59] <ManofLetters[m]> should I anchor somehow?
[17:20:25] <ManofLetters[m]> *anchor it
[17:20:51] <f-a> no
[17:20:52] <f-a> NO!
[17:20:56] <f-a> for the love of God no
[17:21:21] <f-a> what I mean is that a free floating window will have the ratio/dimensions you (the dev) want
[17:21:24] <f-a> which is ok
[17:21:47] <f-a> while the contrary might break aspect ratio
[17:31:30] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, good, thank you :)
[17:33:25] <f-a> gist of my messages is: if tiling wm people see a screwed screen ratio, they will for sure know how to fix it
[17:33:31] <f-a> so do not worry much
[17:34:26] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, got it
[17:36:16] <f-a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cY14BRzRAA we need more of this
[17:40:29] <__monty__> Nicest solution imo is to just only use whatever integer scaled part of the window you can use without warping. Like how mpv would show black bars if you force the window to a different aspect ratio than the video.
[17:42:21] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, makes sense; I'm just too lazy to read window size, calculate, crop the screen texture, etc.
[17:42:45] <ManofLetters[m]> if I had time to do that, I'd rather implement auto-scaling at fullscreen first (similar logic)
[17:42:54] <ManofLetters[m]> and zoom via C-+, C--
[17:43:58] <ManofLetters[m]> not too hard, I think, just too many fun things that can be added to the game compete :(
[17:44:13] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: wow, I haven't seen that

[17:44:56] <f-a> was pretty crowded too ManofLetters[m] 
[17:45:10] <f-a> so your description of "a handful of players" is incorrect
[17:45:55] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm fortunate my Russian is completely rusty, otherwise, I'd stress incredibly about what they say and write :)
[17:46:09] <f-a> haha
[17:46:19] <f-a> did you learn a bit of russian?
[17:48:15] <ManofLetters[m]> I had to
[17:48:27] <ManofLetters[m]> we were occupied by Soviets for almost 50 years
[17:48:33] <ManofLetters[m]> mandatory Russian lessons
[17:48:44] <ManofLetters[m]> (I'm from Poland)
[17:48:56] <f-a> I understand, silly of me not making the co- yeah yeah that I guessed!
[17:51:24] <ManofLetters[m]> :D

[17:54:08] <f-a> I wonder if it is useful today
[17:54:57] <ManofLetters[m]> it sadly may soon be the main survival skill in central Europe
[17:56:56] <f-a> that would be extremely sad, on the other hand could be a nice incipit for a roguelike
[18:01:17] <ManofLetters[m]> let's hope it ends with a cold war
[18:01:25] <ManofLetters[m]> and we have plenty of games about that :)
[18:04:40] <f-a> but yeah being super srs for 30 seconds no, it definitely is not going to happen
[18:05:19] <f-a> it is an extremely distressing situation for ukrainian(sp) people but Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, etc. are in a different place
[18:05:27] <f-a> inside the EU, inside NATO
[18:06:56] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm just leaving to church, so can't dispute, but our eastern border is being attacked for months now by Bielorussian and Russian agenst, among others, so it's not a theory for us
[18:07:20] <ManofLetters[m]> see you!
[18:07:23] <f-a> happy churcing & happily tty later!

[20:59:26] <sm> nice ic.rbow ! got a link to the new list ?
[21:00:17] <icrbow[m]> https://haskell-game.dev/games.html
[21:00:38] <icrbow[m]> I accidentally the site... whole of it
[21:01:14] <icrbow[m]> the links would be in flux for a while
[21:02:02] <sm> thanks.. so site is still updating ? got it
[21:03:44] <sm> if you don't already link them, the wiki, hackage, and github links in room topic might be worth adding
[21:04:13] <icrbow[m]> hackage?
[21:04:21] <icrbow[m]> ah, the categories?..
[21:04:44] <sm> yes, it's a link to the game category there which is the biggest list of haskell games
[21:07:57] <icrbow[m]> if only we could have a page per category instead of dumping everything at once
[21:09:00] <ManofLetters[m]> ic.rbow: https://web.archive.org/web/20211211210839/https://haskell-game.dev/
[21:09:14] <ManofLetters[m]> (it loads forever, though)
[21:10:28] <icrbow[m]> ManofLetters[m]: Well, I have the source. I just accidentally made live the WIP emanote version.
[21:10:38] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, I see
[21:10:52] <icrbow[m]> I can do a rollback, but I just gonna push forward instead.
[21:10:57] <ManofLetters[m]> sure
[21:11:12] <sm> ic.rbow: you may be aware, but there's a noticeable pop when styles change on every page load
[21:12:04] <icrbow[m]> Hm... I only have it on the first hit.
[21:12:31] * sm using safari 15
[21:12:33] <icrbow[m]> Perhaps this should be reported in Emanote
[21:12:56] <sm> if that gets fixed, and if you're planning to keep this going, I could see this being a great main link for this room, personally
[21:14:27] <sm> I have heard of emanote users using obsidian.md to render a website, but perhaps that wouldn't be better
[21:14:56] <sm> biab
[21:15:26] <icrbow[m]> Emanote should be enough. I liked neuron a bit more though.
