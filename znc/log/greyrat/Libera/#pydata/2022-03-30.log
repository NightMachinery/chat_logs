[00:02:09] <bluss> Arrinao: why use iloc?
[00:02:16] <bluss> if .loc works.
[00:03:58] <bluss> I sometimes use iloc like this   df.iloc[np.where(df['Age'] > 28)]   - so using np.where to get the positional indexes
[00:43:40] <Arrinao> bluss and np.where works like .loc?
[01:33:49] <bluss> df['Age'] > 28  gives you a boolean mask - an array/series of the same size of the input filled with True or False
[01:34:05] <bluss> and np.where gives you the indexes where the mask is True. Try it out in ipython or jupyter :)
[01:38:11] <bluss> the most important thing to know is that loc selects using labels (the actual index values and column names) and iloc selects by position (an integer)

[02:45:40] <Arrinao> bluss: alright, but look at this: https://dpaste.com/3YTBUU2ZG there must be some kind of difference because np.where doesn't work in this case, while .loc does
