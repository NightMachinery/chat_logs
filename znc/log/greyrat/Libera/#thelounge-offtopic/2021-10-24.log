[21:51:16] <MiniDigger> I remember nothing about all of this :D
[21:51:28] <MiniDigger> I wonder when I stopped using irc
[21:51:46] <Activ8> you don't? I been in this IRC room 2 years now
[21:51:55] <Activ8> room * channel
[21:53:18] <MiniDigger> uff I just got pinged in a briged channel, I haven't heard that sound in years 
[21:53:43] <Activ8> which bridged channel? I didn't think TL has a bridge?
[21:53:47] <Activ8> oh you mean another one?
[21:56:00] <MiniDigger> yeah, the community I run, PaperMC (we provide the minecraft server software 150k+ servers rely on), has bridged channels on esper which I auto joined
[21:56:24] <Activ8> nice
