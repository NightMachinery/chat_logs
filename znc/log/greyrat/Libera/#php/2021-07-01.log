[16:00:03] *** Joins: kenoba (~kenoba@ip68-0-248-40.ri.ri.cox.net)
[16:00:27] <paule32> to positioning elements ?
[16:00:40] <entuland> your PHP should only generate the main HTML along with possibly the needed classes and IDs, the presentation (margins, paddings and so forth) should be done in CSS separately
[16:00:42] <paule32> it is my framewok
[16:00:44] <paule32> work
[16:01:00] <entuland> well, you're making your own life harder for no reason
[16:02:08] <paule32> it looks like:  https://dpaste.com/AHKJADTKG
[16:02:59] <entuland> what's the end goal?
[16:03:17] <paule32> haveing a web application
[16:03:30] <paule32> application in application
[16:03:43] <paule32> a desktop
[16:03:48] <paule32> a web desktop
[16:04:18] <entuland> it still feels wrong done like that, the vast majority of that stuff (widgeting, moving stuff around, decorating) should be done client side via JS
[16:04:25] <entuland> and CSS, of course
[16:04:46] <paule32> yes, it is
[16:04:57] <paule32> i load js files css files, .. at client side
[16:05:07] <paule32> php makes me template html code
[16:05:11] <entuland> your server backend should pretty much mainly deal with the app _behavior_, i.e. the actual work it's supposed to do
[16:05:14] <paule32> with these code in the paste
[16:06:25] <paule32> i don't like mixing html code with php, either html or php - so php support feature "class", i use it
[16:06:47] <paule32> also custom code
[16:06:57] <paule32> custom code mixing php and html
[16:07:10] <entuland> hiding the details of the HTML markup generation inside the guts of your classes is okay, putting CSS stuff in your PHP code doesn't feel right
[16:07:11] <paule32> ok, it is clear, php need html code, to produce page
[16:07:26] <paule32> but i mean by using a framework, it shows nicer
[16:07:43] <paule32> yes
[16:07:48] <paule32> this is a begin
[16:08:07] <paule32> i could make function with other programing style
[16:08:16] <entuland> it's not about programming style
[16:08:25] <entuland> it's about what you're having your PHP deal with
[16:08:27] <paule32> so, the framework user can use css functions that load external per file
[16:08:54] <paule32> but i dont have minimal template of the framework, it is yet experimental
[16:09:17] <entuland> sorry, it just seems the wrong approach to begin with
[16:09:45] <paule32> yes, it is advance
[16:09:54] <entuland> you should clearly separate those things, let your PHP only output the main HTML with the necessary markup, let CSS and JS deal with the UI on the client side
[16:10:41] <paule32> you can laugh, but i do it
[16:10:53] <entuland> oh I'm not laughing, and to an extent I see your point
[16:11:02] <entuland> I just think it could be made cleaner and leaner
[16:11:08] <biberu> and easier for your sake
[16:11:45] <paule32> i have to say, i come from c++, and delphi programming
[16:12:03] <biberu> me too
[16:12:06] <paule32> so i am a little bit have advantages about classes
[16:12:15] <entuland> the only customizable things you may need to persist on the server side, to be restored on page reloads if needed, are window positions and sizes, pretty much nothing more than that - well, maybe maximized / minimized
[16:12:21] <biberu> delphi was a long time ago though
[16:12:31] <entuland> so those are the only things you may need to deal with directly in PHP
[16:13:08] <biberu> but it seems like you're typing at lot that shouldn't be needed, and probably restricting your options quite a bit
[16:13:44] <entuland> colors, decorations, margins, paddings and all the rest should be done via CSS using classes, you don't even need JS for that
[16:14:06] <paule32> i don't know how to describe, but, i have think php can create html, and it is used to create html by many users, so i go a step wider, and combine the html coding with a framework, that output templates html + js + css
[16:14:19] <paule32> yes
[16:14:20] <entuland> your client side JS should only take care of, say, allowing resizing and dragging around, dispatching the necessary info to the server to be persisted
[16:14:22] <paule32> you right
[16:14:46] <entuland> separation of concerns is a big thing in programming
[16:15:01] <paule32> but i have messed up my time with esayui, but easyui is a little bit cost intensive, and don't make this what i had expect
[16:15:04] <paule32> many bugs
[16:15:11] <paule32> so many time wasteing on me
[16:15:14] <paule32> damm
[16:15:33] <paule32> had i investigate some more time, and i code my own, i am wider
[16:16:17] <entuland> is this some kind of toy project of yourself to learn web technologies or you're after making some product to be used by others / sold or the alike?
[16:16:53] <paule32> the last one, also making a product, but for non-profit
[16:17:06] <paule32> ok, today, it is my hobby
[16:17:25] <paule32> but i think, it could be sinfull for others
[16:18:26] <entuland> define "sinfull"
[16:18:58] <paule32> ehm, make web applications faster, and easier
[16:19:07] <paule32> dont hang with html stuff
[16:22:11] <biberu> i might be wrong, but from that example i feel that you might benefit from going back to experimenting with alternate ways to structure your html and css before trying to automate too much
[16:22:54] <paule32> yes
[16:24:07] <paule32> see https://www.kallup.net/pub
[16:24:12] <paule32> user: demo
[16:24:13] <biberu> and i don't know what you're doing with js, but consider that many people don't even write that manually these days, it's commonly compiled from other languages like e.g. typescript or f#, and even those that do write js probably have build steps for linting, bundling, testing etc, so you should consider how those workflows would fit into that
[16:24:13] <biberu> interface
[16:24:17] <paule32> pass: 1234
[16:25:09] <paule32> and yes, these examples, will be produced by a compiler, later
[16:30:40] <entuland> ehehe
[16:30:48] <entuland> I got in with "demo" user and "demo" password
[16:30:57] <entuland> so take a note and fix your login check :P

[18:18:11] <jcrawford> Hello everyone, I am working with Guzzle 7.x and have found that when using the MockHandler it is throwing an out of bounds exception that the queue is empty.  I read that this happens when you do not have enough responses in the mock handler and the code you are testing is making more requests than you have responses.  However, it seems like the
[18:18:11] <jcrawford> more responses I add the more requests that are  made, for instance I added 20 responses and it tried to make 21 requests, I then added 30 responses and it tried to make 31 requests.  There are no infinite loops in my code so I am baffled why this would be happening.  Has anyone here experienced anything similar using Guzzle 7?
[18:27:56] <AllenJB> jcrawford: Can you pastebin the code, or a minimal example that reproduces the issue?
[18:29:43] <__adrian> "paule32> $class_str  = get_class($root);"  // that's the classname, not the name of any method, so i'm still unclear what you mean by "class function.". what is it you're trying to do?

[18:35:36] <Naktibalda> jcrawford: can you retrieve data about requests from MockHandler?
[18:35:41] <dimi1947> is the length of the hash is going to increase in the future I suppose VARCHAR would be the proper datatype for storing the hash in the db

[18:36:15] <dimi1947> is=if

[18:37:36] <dimi1947> it says 255 chars would be a good choice but it does not say anything about the datatype
[18:37:53] <__adrian> jcrawford: do any of your responses give a Location header, and are you then following it?
[18:38:04] <jcrawford> AllenJB I figured out the issue but thank you, appears the test code was reading the live database not the test database so there were over 1000 records hence why i didn't have enough responses :D
[18:38:15] <dimi1947> I assume the word expands rings a bell about varchar
[18:39:12] <Blondie101010> it just tells you the length requirement
[18:39:20] <Blondie101010> how you store it doesn't matter
[18:40:36] <AllenJB> jcrawford: You might want to look at separating and firewalling your environments so you can't run tests against live!
[18:40:55] <__adrian> ^ it should not be _possible_ to "accidentially" hit prod
[18:41:09] <Byteflux> Yes, that way you don't end up like HBO Max, sending integration test emails to every customer.
[18:41:11] <Byteflux> :)
[18:41:15] <jcrawford> sorry not prod but my local database vs a testing sqlite database :D
[18:41:18] <__adrian> this implies (for example) that you have passwords just floating around
[18:41:19] <Blondie101010> true, but also pointing to a dev/test structure problem
[18:43:17] <__adrian> "jcrawford> sorry not prod but my local database vs a testing sqlite database"  // still sounds like you have things sticking where they shouldn't be. e.g., is your config stored in vcs?
[18:46:18] <jcrawford> nah we recently refactored the codebase to laravel 8 and php 8 and I was not using the proper Testing module so was completely my mistake not code issues :D
[18:46:31] <jcrawford> I didn't have the test stuff setup in the .env
[18:47:02] <jcrawford> so it defaulted to the dev database on my local system which had a ton of data already in it causing issues with the tests
[18:48:03] <__adrian> that's the kind of thing i would not have a default for
