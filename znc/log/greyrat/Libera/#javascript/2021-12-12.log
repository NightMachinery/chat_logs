[05:58:39] <Sven_vB> like when you do stuff in PHP just because PHP on the webserver is already approved by management
[06:01:05] <theskillwithin> i think thats called having a job?
[06:01:44] <Sven_vB> nah, I do have a job at which we strive to use the best tools available
[06:02:22] <Sven_vB> I'm looking for a word somewhat like fault-tolerant probably. not a native english speaker though
[06:02:41] <Sven_vB> fool-tolerant comes to mind but also only overlaps in part
[06:02:50] <theskillwithin> anti fragile
[06:02:58] <theskillwithin> non brittle
[06:03:00] <theskillwithin> idk
[06:03:15] <Sven_vB> yeah, that's more the direction

[06:05:13] <EdFletcher> Lol polite is fine, I just meant we didn’t need to know it was unexpected _toilet_ time. Just stepping away is enough 😆

[06:10:41] <velix> some kind of web-worker?
[06:11:36] <EdFletcher> you don't really need a background worker, just use `setTimeout` every 60 seconds or whatever

[06:12:46] <EdFletcher> no worries, and fwiw i do a lot of backend too, `setTimeout` works the same in node as it does in the browser
[06:13:06] <velix> EdFletcher: So no need for this? await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

[06:13:19] <EdFletcher> if you like `cron` and want to schedule things that way, i like this module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron
[06:13:43] <EdFletcher> velix: no that's basically a "delay" function, that _does_ block your code. i don't think that's what you want
[06:14:14] <velix> EdFletcher: Okay. Sorry, our new frontend guy doesn't work on weekends, but I want to build some prototypes :D
[06:14:33] <EdFletcher> no worries
[06:15:07] <velix> hehe "cron" is really linux cron. funny. thanks
[06:15:47] <EdFletcher> yup it's awesome! has better resolution that unix cron though, seconds rather than minutes as the smallest unit

[06:23:15] <EdFletcher> no you said you were backend so i recommended that
[06:23:24] <EdFletcher> yeah just use setTimeout in the browser
[06:23:37] <EdFletcher> with a bundler you could use that module but for prototyping that'd be overkill

[07:47:07] <Maxdamantus> or maybe you're meant to specify the default import when using `import(..)`, since `typeof import("./bar").default` does something useful for me, but `typeof import("./bar")` doesn't.

[12:42:52] <D4mned> oh alright
[12:43:19] <D4mned> so it would be like a jwt token stored in the browser
[12:43:54] <D4mned> and then a middleware keeping track of what pages this user is visiting right ?

[12:47:19] <D4mned> oh well i dont know trafficjam you could do it without using sessions i guess but then you ll be just implementing sessions ur own way of keeping track of sessions
[12:48:06] <trafficjam> the main point is that localStorage data is stored by the browser in the user's file system, so you don't need to pass any user identifying information, because that's implicit when they use a particular machine
[12:48:53] <D4mned> yeah but you are saying you want to keep track of their most visited pages right ?
[12:48:55] <trafficjam> which obviously means if the user accesses the app from a different machine, that information won't be available. But that goes back to my question of when to use localStorage vs Redis
[12:49:16] <trafficjam> yeah, but i'm not sure how persistent i want that data to be

[12:51:36] <D4mned> i dont know maybe it works maybe its the proper way but for me it sounds weird
[12:52:02] <trafficjam> there's no proper way, it's just about trade-offs and what is sufficient
[12:52:12] <D4mned> yeah i guess
[12:53:31] <D4mned> but my personal choice would be go for sessions and use redis
[12:55:13] <trafficjam> D4mned: yeah guess i need to think about it some more, specifically about what exactly is the feature i'm trying to give to the user

[20:48:09] <silly> yea... did i say psychosis? lol. you can find truth and source, but only if you renounce to islam the other religions
[20:48:27] <wroathe> I recently undertook an "academic" reading of the bible for my own self study. I didn't remember just how little of the bible actually has anything to do with Jesus
[20:49:44] <michigan> Cool
[20:49:45] <wroathe> Plot-wise, it's like 80% a history lesson of Jewish beliefs and the ancient mediterranean region
[20:49:48] <michigan> That kinda makes sense though
[20:49:52] <silly> humanity really has reached a state where it could progress from it's medieval believe systems

[20:50:14] <wroathe> And then they hit the new testament like 80% of the way into the book and all of a sudden the new religion dislikes the old religion
[20:50:31] <michigan> Jesus didn't exist in the Old Testament, and the New Testament is all fiction.
[20:50:49] <stenno> can we maybe drop flamebait topices
[20:50:51] <silly> michigan, it's all fictin
[20:50:52] <michigan> Yet, Jesus is mentioned more times than any other prophet in the Quran.
[20:51:18] <michigan> The only difference is - Islam calls him a prophet, whereas Christianity calls him a God.
[20:51:21] <silly> or what stenno says! we could get a channel for this tho
[20:51:29] <michigan> true, i digress
