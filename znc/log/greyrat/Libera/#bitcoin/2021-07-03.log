So every time you make a transaction another transaction is created that can spend the UTXO at a later date. So in case you die - after 20 years or something.

[03:32:42] <matthewcroughan> Hey. There is no way to reduce a transaction fee after it has been sent, right?
[03:32:49] <matthewcroughan> You can only increase using replace by fee?
[03:33:16] <matthewcroughan> The reason I ask is because the Bisq wallet has a bug in it which caused my transaction to be sent with a really high fee.
[03:34:47] <matthewcroughan> I wanted to sent at 3 sat/vbyte but it sent it at 86/vbyte instead. Really quite annoying.

[03:50:56] <as2333> yeah it's strange
[03:53:14] <matthewcroughan> I do not understand the mechanism by which the fee is set in a bitcoin transaction.
[03:53:24] <matthewcroughan> Is it simple? Is it just part of the payload so to speak, since bitcoin is a protocol?
[03:53:31] <as2333> yes
[03:53:40] <matthewcroughan> So how is it possible to get wrong? :D
[03:53:49] <matthewcroughan> Literally, a packet, and part of that packet contains a number. A template.
[03:53:49] <as2333> it's whatever amount is not sent to an output
[03:54:21] <matthewcroughan> I mean, I was using dd yesterday to copy the first 446 bytes of disks to convert disks to mbr from gpt.
[03:54:30] <as2333> but the problem in this case has little to do with bitcoin I'd say  - more like a fuckup in the GUI code of that wallet or something.
[03:54:39] <matthewcroughan> And somehow I didn't screw that up, but bisq can screw up fee=x?

[03:54:53] <matthewcroughan> ah yeah, I can see that
[03:55:06] <matthewcroughan> it sent the automatic fee, rather than the one I set in the gui, so maybe there's disconnect, that makes sense.
[03:55:20] <as2333> if say you have a 1btc input and a 0.9btc output, then the fee 0.1btc
[03:55:29] <as2333> fee +is
[03:56:07] <matthewcroughan> The moral is obvious. Don't use GUIs.
[03:56:08] <as2333> whatever is not sent explicitly to some output ends up as fee - that's the protocol.
[03:56:47] <matthewcroughan> Ah okay, so it's the delta between the two.
[03:57:17] <matthewcroughan> I understood it's nothing to do with Bitcoin itself from the start, just to be clear.
[03:57:46] <matthewcroughan> I figure it should, in the bisq code, not be sending transactions with a default encoded value.
[03:58:06] <matthewcroughan> the fee should be null until set
[03:58:21] <matthewcroughan> and for bisq, it probably makes sense to remove automatic fee calculation

[04:20:27] <as2333> matthewcroughan, automatic fee setting is a pretty stupid idea 'in my opinion'. Apart from bugs like the one you just had the pleasure to experience, it makes no sense from an economic point of view since the fee is a price that the user must decide himself.
[04:20:51] <matthewcroughan> Indeed. Just like in real world visa transfer.
[04:21:03] <matthewcroughan> Automatic fee might make sense in the context of lightning though?
[04:21:39] <matthewcroughan> Since it's so low, the user shouldn't ever have to care? As long as there's a guarantee of confirmation within seconds and an upper bound of pennies.
[04:21:52] <as2333> it's the same thing. You should decide what price you think is right. That's how market prices are supposed to work.
