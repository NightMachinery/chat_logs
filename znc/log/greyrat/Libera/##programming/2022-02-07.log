[00:00:02] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I hate how internet is unfriendly mess
[00:00:06] <ProfSimm> ski: well LISP is also very close to tokens.

[00:00:09] <absentia> Ronalds_Mazitis_: welcome to the real world
[00:00:18] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> it is not real fucking world
[00:00:22] <absentia> you're right
[00:00:23] <ski> (but then, i don't primarily think of DSLs (or programming in general) on a concrete syntactical level, with tokens, but more on an AST level)
[00:00:24] <absentia> smart one
[00:00:36] <ProfSimm> ski: yes, it's a tree of lists, mine also is, but the point is we have a small number of universal primitivies which we can then customize. Like a RISC processor if you will
[00:00:45] <ski> ProfSimm : Lisp macros don't work on text or tokens. they work on trees
[00:01:04] <ski> (and this is a major reason why they're much nicer to use than e.g. CPP)
[00:01:16] <ProfSimm> ski: yes trees. What are trees in LISP? Literally branches are 1:1 with tokens. The only thing you have resolved for you us () nesting.
[00:01:27] <ProfSimm> is*
[00:01:29] <ski> sure
[00:01:33] <ski> and that is a big deal
[00:01:40] <ProfSimm> Well sure, but I also do that
[00:01:49] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I can't seem to get help ever
[00:01:58] <absentia> probably lisp's most important quality is its homoiconicity
[00:01:59] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: NO YOU WILL NEVER GET HELP
[00:02:01] <ProfSimm> :D
[00:02:05] <ProfSimm> That's your fate.
[00:02:06] <ski> oh, then i would argue that "I want to keep the AST as close to a \"bunch of tokens\" as I can" is not the case
[00:02:11] <absentia> every other attempt at homoiconicity just ends up producing a lisp-like syntax

[01:37:22] <apotheon> Oh, I forgot to mention a very big problem:
[01:37:28] <apotheon> Hiring a replacement is *hugely* expensive.

[01:38:11] <apotheon> There's also the fact that the (often indirect) interactions between employees' activities are like those between tightly coupled spaghetti codebases.  If something breaks, it also breaks other things.
[01:38:25] *** Quits: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:38:32] <pyzozord> yeah but bigger companies have easier time hiring people because big mark attracts, they also have bigger budget, so relatively speaking as company grows hiring effort should be decreasing
[01:38:39] <apotheon> . . . so recovering from the loss of a person, including all the time other employees will have to spend teaching the replacement, is expensive.
[01:39:01] <apotheon> It's not just effort.  It directly costs money to hire people.
[01:39:12] <pyzozord> I mean I know hiring is hard etc
[01:39:24] <apotheon> One of the reasons bigger companies often find it easier to hire people is that they spend more money on hiring.
[01:39:46] <pyzozord> but I'm talking specifically about the linear relationship that the cost is bigger as the company grows, that's counter intuitive for me
[01:39:55] <apotheon> . . . and being easier for "the company" comes at the cost of more people *within* the company putting *more time* into it.
[01:40:19] <apotheon> It's not necessarily bigger as a percentage of the company's bottom line.  It's bigger in terms of the number of dollars lost per employee.
[01:40:51] <apotheon> (It might also be bigger as a percentage of the bottom line, depending on the employee and how the company is managed.)
[01:41:18] <apotheon> They also might end up hiring a contractor to fill in at multiples of the employees' total cost of retention.

[03:02:11] <pulse> for some cases geometry is clearer. for most cases, algebra is far superior

[03:13:43] <ProfSimm> pulse: the visual structure won't become invalid because it has no braces to mismatch
[03:14:01] <pulse> yeah but you'll spend more time making it, and it's borderline ridiculous
[03:14:01] <absentia> ProfSimm: this is true

[03:14:50] <absentia> nomagno: yep
[03:14:56] <absentia> stupid wetware

[07:14:46] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[07:15:18] <ProfSimm> Think about why most recommendations are to keep functions and methods short.

[07:15:26] <ProfSimm> Why?

[07:16:29] <tangy> okay
[07:16:33] <vin> What would be a memcmp equivalent in python?
[07:16:33] <[itchyjunk]> Recomendations can be arbitrary.
[07:16:41] <FloridaMan> Branching logic in functions is more dangerous than length
[07:16:53] <epony> vin, that's a serious question
[07:16:56] <FloridaMan> How many levels of branching, specifically
[07:17:07] <epony> dynamic languages don't have manual memory management
[07:17:18] <sonny> In python it would be assignment I think
[07:17:40] <ProfSimm> vin: are you comparing arbitrary vars, or something specific
[07:18:09] <epony> pointer arithmetic is going to be a tougher one
[07:18:26] <vin> epony: so if I have a 10B of binary data, is there a way to compare them with each other to say which is greater? in python. This is easy in C. ProfSimm 
[07:18:58] <sonny> len(b0) > len(b1)

[07:19:48] <sonny> vin: not the same as what?

[07:28:18] <epony> why would you do it on the whole file instead of a small portion of it for quick initial passes is the "dynamic" approach
[07:29:38] <ProfSimm> FloridaMan: I was thinking, what if a function's first statement is the return value, and all the rest are binding definitions that get used by this initial statement, or by other bindings. This means your most relevant line(s) of code is on top of a method, and effectively renders a method structured clearly even if it's long
[07:30:26] <epony> now, what if you had 100GB of a binary data sets (cause that's what your users will do)

[09:10:12] <rindolf> EdFletcher: it's fearing fear
[09:10:25] <InPhase> It's basically a mental exercise, and it can help you understand some edge cases of a language.

[09:10:42] <EdFletcher> *that 
[09:10:48] <FloridaMan> ^
[09:10:56] <InPhase> That's not the fault of golf, but the fault of not having software engineering principles first and foremost.
[09:11:04] <FloridaMan> This is true
[09:11:24] <EdFletcher> ok fine, but the results are the same: the bad habits develop and end up where they don't belong 
[09:12:10] <FloridaMan> This is also true
[09:12:11] <ejjfunky> EdFletcher, just like bringing competitive programming mentality to work?

[09:13:00] <FloridaMan> At least if you're going to get anything done
[09:13:20] <FloridaMan> Point being you need to rely on habits, and forming golfing habits is no bueno
[09:14:14] <EdFletcher> FloridaMan: yup like that, contextually different but often manifests with the same negative results! 
[09:14:15] <FloridaMan> And, if you do it enough, you will integrate it as a habit. That's kind of how they form.
[09:14:23] <EdFletcher> ^that's a bingo 
[09:14:57] <FloridaMan> You're better off thinking about your architecture than shortening your statements
[09:15:05] <InPhase> I've never seen that be a problem for anyone who mixes in a little recreational code golf.
[09:15:22] <EdFletcher> it's like when i was learning to play brass with braces, all the instructors were _really_ worried i'd even start trying to learn. i kept asking why and they all said the same thing: you'll develop embouchure habits you'll never get rid of. and they were right! once i got the braces off i _never_ learned to play as well as i had before. 
[09:15:48] <EdFletcher> it seems innocuous but in the long run it can do real damage 
[09:16:20] <FloridaMan> InPhase: maybe not a problem for them, but I wonder if their code reviewers thought the same ;)
[09:16:36] <EdFletcher> i was also the clever cram-everything-into-one-line coder in college and got _slammed_ in my first professional code review. no one else wanted to read that line noise. 
[09:16:47] <EdFletcher> hahaha dammit FloridaMan you read my mind 
[09:17:09] <EdFletcher> and that's exactly it. you may think it's perfectly readable because you're so familiar with it, but your colleagues will hate you for it. 
[09:17:33] <EdFletcher> (if it manages to get through code review, which let's hope it never does) 
[09:18:48] <FloridaMan> They should also ask for clarity, but when something is technically correct but unclear you (the reviewer) start wondering whether *you're* the one who is sub-par in your skill level

[09:21:02] <InPhase> ejjfunky: And it doesn't necessarily have to be the manager, but someone senior should generally be in charge of setting architectural guidelines for large projects.
[09:21:15] <ejjfunky> the common excuse is, look, i'm in a time crunch. it wasnt my fault yesterday we had a whole day of meeting with management, etc.
[09:21:30] <rindolf> ejjfunky: fc-solve's code is peppered with #ifdef-s
[09:21:32] <EdFletcher> yeah a senior leader / team lead should set the direction, but it must be in the team's hands: it's their code, their artifact 
[09:21:44] <EdFletcher> FloridaMan: word. does no one refactor anymore? 
[09:22:19] <loganlee[gnu]> omg
[09:22:29] <EdFletcher> "rewrite instead of refactor" is definitely a mantra i've seen at more places than i'd like... 
[09:22:52] <FloridaMan> I try to leave every file I touch better than I found it, but in full transparency many times I simply forget
[09:23:10] <EdFletcher> of course, we all do, but having the _intention_ alone is more than a lot do 
[09:23:23] <ejjfunky> EdFletcher, the problem with senior that also code, to junior -> WTF? Can't you code?! I'm telling the manager.
[09:23:26] <InPhase> ejjfunky: Where a manager has a key definitive role is in making sure technical debt does not grow over time in projects.  Management needs to take the risks of technical debt seriously, and manage them by assigning time and prioritization to this.
[09:23:32] <EdFletcher> and having the intention means you'll act on it at least some of the time, whereas without it you'll surely act on it 0% of the time

[10:17:02] <vin> How can I possible specify index in a filter. I mean foo = filter(lambda s: i % 10 == 0, data) where data is a bytearray and I want foo to be a list of 10 bytes at 100 byte offsets of data. InPhase ski I am not sure if filter isn't enough I guess
[10:17:21] <absentia> vin: use a lexical closure
[10:17:30] <absentia> and increment the closed over variable in your lambda
[10:17:33] <absentia> [\heresy]
[10:19:42] <arahael> itertools might have a windowing function.
[10:23:07] <absentia> itertools.islice perhaps
[10:23:57] <arahael> Also, there's .enumerate().
[10:24:03] <arahael> (Which gives you that 'i')
[10:25:21] <vin> how would I use enumerate in filter arahael?
[10:26:21] <arahael> vin: You could enumerate, then map, each result to either empty lists or a list of one item, then concatenate the reuslts, avoiding filter.
[10:26:22] <FloridaMan> Anyway you want "i % 100 < 10" probably
[10:26:30] <arahael> vin: However, honestly, in Python, I'd use a classic 'for' loop.
[10:26:31] <FloridaMan> If my brain is still working
[10:26:42] <absentia> i am vindicated
[10:27:02] <absentia> fr i would just use a for loop, an index, seek, and read
[10:27:07] <arahael> vin: It's going to be faster, more direct, and more conventional for python.  Functional programming style is a poor fit for the language.
[10:27:17] <absentia> not everything needs to be programmed at the absolute heights of mathematical beauty
[10:27:36] <vin> yup absentia arahael did that using a for loop but I want to write it in a map reduce setup for spark
[10:28:19] <arahael> vin: Then you probably want to use whatever api's spark gives for this, otherwise there isn't much point.
[10:28:26] <arahael> (I don't know what spark is)
[10:29:01] <vin> it provides the same map, reduce, filter, groupby apis python does. RDDs are essentially dataframes that you transform
[10:29:48] <arahael> vin: I'd consider map and/or reduce, then.  Just make sure you're using spark's routines, otherwise you're not going to see an improvement.
[10:29:53] <absentia> use the damn closure
[10:30:29] <arahael> Closure would work also.

[10:47:39] <FloridaMan> Is there a kernel of truth to that?
[10:47:43] <pikapika> EdFletcher, I haven't yet had a mac
[10:47:47] <pikapika> But my point is
[10:47:51] <pikapika> "Unix" is a subtle topic
[10:48:13] <EdFletcher> FloridaMan: yup! https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3663.htm https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/1490 
[10:48:17] <deniska> gnu/linux is nice enough unix simulator, and typically works well on your average IBM PC clone :)
[10:48:18] <bayaz> Title: Open Brand 
[10:48:18] <bayaz> Title: Is Mac OS X UNIX? 
[10:48:22] <pikapika> While Mac is certified to be a unix, spiritually I think linux, which isn't a certified unix, is closer to unix
[10:48:26] <pikapika> BSD is probably even closer
[10:48:33] <pikapika> And solaris should count as a proper unix
[10:48:35] <pikapika> etc
[10:48:47] <FloridaMan> EdFletcher: I was simply asking for the dad joke appeal
[10:49:02] <pikapika> So I would say, I would consider myself to have used Unix if I can try out Solaris
[10:49:09] <EdFletcher> FloridaMan: hahaha dammit, i wondered but missed the nonverbal cues 😃 
[10:49:20] <deniska> pikapika: there're various opensolaris forks
[10:49:37] <pikapika> Of course it'd be ideal if I could use a unix system v on an original pdp

[10:49:43] <pikapika> deniska, oh
[10:49:44] <deniska> Illumos is the most supported lately I think?
[10:49:52] <pikapika> I'll have to look into the solaris forks then
[10:49:55] <EdFletcher> pikapika: all i was saying is that mac os is a literal certified UNIX, so regardless of your definition of what counts "spiritually", mac os counts literally 
[10:50:03] <pikapika> EdFletcher, I know it is "certified"
[10:50:17] <deniska> Windows NT also was a certified unix at some point :)
[10:50:19] <EdFletcher> ok well you asked, then turned it around on my answer, which is a bit annoying 
[10:50:21] <arahael> macos is definitely a unix. I use it every day.  It's unix in every sense of the word.
[10:50:22] <pikapika> But I treat Unix as how close it is to thompsons original is

[10:50:57] <pikapika> arahael, "unix" in this sense is a measure of historical lineage and proximity
[10:51:14] <absentia> there's literally a unix certification?

[11:14:30] <pikapika> 2007 came with a dvd and a lifetime license

[11:14:37] <pikapika> rindolf, yeah

[11:14:40] <epony> it's worse than Office 2000

[11:15:39] <absentia> you buy cs2, you get cs2
[11:15:44] <pikapika> the fraction of 10 computers we see is not due to users wanting them but due to them being forced against hteir wishes to use it

[11:16:45] <pikapika> It was hard obtaining pre installed win 7 already even in 2015
[11:17:03] <absentia> OEM discs were cheaper anyway
[11:17:16] <pikapika> People who were in on it were buying the freedos laptops
[11:17:21] <pikapika> and installing fro ma windows 7 dvd
[11:17:37] <pikapika> no point in paying twice, once for something you don't want, and once for what you want

[11:17:54] <epony> you know there are WIN/DOS images on torrents with license keys and everything patched etc and original ones
[11:17:58] <absentia> especially once i heard they were eol'ing it

[11:18:19] <epony> you can run that software perpetual, just shot sessions at a time, because it runs poorly and fails often

[11:19:38] <epony> WIN is not relevant any more

[14:43:31] <absentia> or modular synths
[14:43:38] <pikapika> And its still an overpriced industry
[14:43:44] <absentia> because it's damn hard
[14:43:47] <absentia> esoteric knowledge
[14:43:48] <pikapika> Even if slightly cheaper perhaps than the originals
[14:43:50] <absentia> and a niche consumer base
[14:44:06] <absentia> you can get a $20 BOSS pedal at a garage sale
[14:44:09] <pikapika> Niche consumer base is a result of their own self imposed artificial scarcity
[14:44:10] <absentia> you're right
[14:44:13] <absentia> it also sounds like fucking ass
[14:44:22] <Mortician> lol
[14:44:26] <Mortician> ass
[14:44:34] <Mortician> i like ass
[14:44:43] <absentia> if it was in fact so easy let's see someone take over the $20-$80 range of that market
[14:44:44] <pikapika> Its like asking why macs are niche compared to other laptops
[14:44:47] <absentia> with pedals that can perform at the $200+ range
[14:44:51] <KillerWasp> pikapika: interesting, you're say that any electronic equipment related to music is of poor quality.
[14:44:56] <absentia> and run a sustainable business on it
[14:44:56] <pikapika> Its because apple self selected a niche market
[14:45:02] <pikapika> with their pricing
[14:45:18] <pikapika> KillerWasp, I am not saying its poor quality, I am saying its overpriced
[14:45:24] <pikapika> Remember the CD scandal in the 90s
[14:45:26] <Mortician> pikapika, ur brain is very small
[14:45:27] <absentia> who says what price is fair?
[14:45:38] <pikapika> Thats only the case where we actually made the situation public
[14:45:38] *** Joins: cursey (~cursey@user/cursey)

[14:46:57] <KillerWasp> 18<pikapika18> And its still an overpriced industry
[14:47:02] <pikapika> KillerWasp, yes
[14:47:03] <KillerWasp> i found it maybe.
[14:47:08] <pikapika> CDs are only a case that was made public
[14:47:14] <absentia> pikapika: yes oligopolies are bad
[14:47:15] <pikapika> The default state of the industry is overpriced
[14:47:31] <absentia> it's too bad that intellectual property law is what has allowed the RIAA, Sony, Warner, etc. to solidify their position as market incumbents
[14:47:45] <absentia> and enable this kind of collusion
[14:47:47] <KillerWasp> uh, CD also?
[14:48:07] <pikapika> Cultures that had to make their own infra had prices that are at least a bit more sane
[14:48:13] <pikapika> but still they are bound by external factors too
[14:48:32] <absentia> the recording industry is a relic of an age where pressing vinyl or CDs required immense capital investment
[14:48:36] <absentia> now you can just release something on bandcamp
[14:48:49] <absentia> so instead of adapting to the changing milieu the recording industry relies on trillions in litigation
[14:48:52] <KillerWasp> CDs musics... probably the record industries have something more to do with all this. Which has been happening since the war against piracy.
[14:48:58] <pikapika> absentia, diy music infrastructure already started in the 70s and was completely solidified by the early 80s
[14:49:18] <absentia> pikapika: absolutely
[14:49:22] <pikapika> So at least if you chose those, you'd have something a bit more sane
[14:49:22] <absentia> just look at punk
[14:49:28] <pikapika> absentia, yes punk and death metal
[14:49:38] <pikapika> Thats what I was thinking about too

[15:44:06] <pikapika> I don't have usb c charging
[15:44:10] <koollman> the last hard point for me was finding a laptop with a rj45 port. but that's just me, and reasonably I can understand why they get rare :)

[15:44:31] <pikapika> amigojapan, yeah but like
[15:44:40] <pikapika> just a few years ago you had generic and removable batteries
[15:44:48] <pikapika> The phone companies are all in on it
[15:45:03] <deniska> I'm eyeing Sharp for a phone too

[15:45:08] <amigojapan> I agree pikapika 
[15:45:27] <deniska> Kinda hard to get in Russia, but I mean, my previous phone was Motorola which also isn't officially imported :)

[15:45:44] <pikapika> amigojapan, its amazing how locked down phones are. The laptop manufacturers are looking at phone manufacturers and drooling in envy.
[15:45:45] <amigojapan> deniska: I am happy with this phone. I have an sh-m12
[15:45:46] <koollman> pikapika: usb-c charging is probably the best modern feature in laptops (or elsewhere). we started making it a requirement 2 years ago at work for any new device. It's sooo much easier to not have to find the right charger when someone lose it or it stops working ... "here. take this generic replacement". it's great
[15:46:02] <pikapika> koollman, yeah generic charging interface would be great
[15:46:05] <pikapika> Good point
[15:46:11] *** Quits: job (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9) (Remote host closed the connection)

[15:46:45] <koollman> and ... now that there are external batteries that can provide 60 or 100W usb-c charge ... it's even nicer
[15:47:00] <deniska> also while batteries are non-standard shape and glued in, they have better capacity than generic cells
[15:47:30] <koollman> well, they have the exact maximum volume and weight available in the design. which helps autonomy :)
[15:47:32] <deniska> modern laptop easily lasts 10-15 hours, 15 years ago they lasted maybe 2 if you had an extended beefy one :)
[15:47:55] <pikapika> Thats more due to advancements in power management
[15:47:56] <deniska> (granted CPUs also became much less power hungry)
[15:48:00] <pikapika> than due to increase in battery power
[15:48:07] <koollman> pikapika: it's a bit of both
[15:48:16] <koollman> (but mostly power management)
[15:48:30] <pyzozord> my thinkpad x230 battery has 28% capacity and it lasts like max 30 minutes
[15:49:02] <amigojapan> pikapika: I don't get why people defend planned obsolesce. It should be illegal
[15:49:12] <pikapika> amigojapan, exactly
[15:49:24] <pikapika> Hardware companies have long been antagonistic to users
[15:49:55] <deniska> I don't defend it, but you should distinguish between planned obsolescence and just not caring, or choosing a different tradeoff
[15:50:18] <amigojapan> pikapika: and it is famous that electronics from the 50s lasted forever
[15:50:55] <deniska> amigojapan: only one which didn't break :D
[15:50:58] <koollman> amigojapan: removing a feature from a new model isn't planned obsolescence. it would be the opposite, making the older model last longer because people don't want to change
[15:52:01] <koollman> having a specific charger that works with only one or two generations of a specific set of laptops, yeah, that was planned obsolescence. the charger still worked, but you had to replace it if you changed hardware
[15:52:18] <amigojapan> koollman: I agree with the CD. But not with glued in battery
[15:53:03] <koollman> I can see some arguments for the battery, but I would rather have the option to choose when buying

[15:53:44] <amigojapan> koollman: they are all in cahoots. We very rarely have an option
[15:53:51] <koollman> and it's basically impossible to find a modern laptop with detachable/replaceable battery nowadays, so that's bad

[15:55:14] <koollman> but, please do tell me which models have detachable/replaceable batteries, and how many models that represent in the market ?
[15:55:47] <epony> just open the battery section of ebay yourself, you're grown up
[15:56:21] <amigojapan> koollman: even worse. They are making it so they can't boot anymore when the battery can't charge anymore
[15:56:59] <koollman> epony: I'm not sure how I would prove lack of options
[15:57:03] <amigojapan> epony: they sell batteries for stuff that is not really replaceable too
[15:57:28] <amigojapan> Not easily replaceable*
[15:57:54] <pikapika> amigojapan, yeah its very risky
[15:58:10] <amigojapan> I have changed batteries of iPhones and macbooks
[15:58:13] <pikapika> you have to heat the glue and then pray that the heat does not damage the electronics
[15:58:21] <koollman> I had a x230. battery replacement was a 3s operation with no tools :)
[15:58:37] <pikapika> even in cases where glue isn't used, they deliberately place the battery very deep inside

[16:01:24] <pikapika> epony, it is less issue if the device can operate directly with mains if battery fails
[16:01:32] <pikapika> as is the case with many laptops
[16:01:40] <pikapika> And thank god for that
[16:01:40] <amigojapan> Gameboy was built like a brick
[16:01:59] <pyzozord> old tech was so much more robust
[16:01:59] <epony> supposedly but most surprising when you pull the battery and your devices goes blip and stops
[16:02:01] <pikapika> Since this is actually a very useful feature that is helpful to consumers, I am waiting when it will be killed off
[16:02:08] <epony> try it ;-)
[16:02:26] <pyzozord> first we stop caring about robustness and now we intentionally make things fragile because that sells more units
[16:02:42] <epony> leave your laptop on mains, pull the battery, tell me if it still works.. the jokes on you
[16:03:11] <koollman> I would ... if I could pull the battery easily. which was the previous point :)

[16:03:33] <epony> yeah
[16:04:04] <pyzozord> what I need is some kind of configuration that skips the battery circutry completely when laptop is connected to the wall
[16:04:36] <pyzozord> why it's all constantly draining and charging battery everywhere all the time is beyond my reasoning
[16:04:50] <koollman> pyzozord: it's not, generally
[16:04:54] <epony> built-in charger / commutator is like a mini-UPS
[16:05:11] <epony> the more popular designs you have are charge-through mode of operation
[16:05:14] <deniska> pyzozord: it… shouldn't really touch the battery when connected to the wall and fully charged
[16:05:19] <amigojapan> pyzozord: well. It needs to do that to keep the life of the battery longer
[16:05:23] <pyzozord> koollman: so why do they say that using electronics with battery while connected to a charger is a very bad for the battery?
[16:05:33] <koollman> pyzozord: who says that ?
[16:05:46] <epony> where the battery is the power of the laptop, and you can choose to charge it or not (with in use charge being the typical use)
[16:06:07] <pyzozord> I always hear it that using your phone or laptop when it's connected to charger while keeping battery inside is unhealthy for the battery
[16:06:10] <amigojapan> pyzozord: that used to be the case long ago
[16:06:22] <deniska> pyzozord: bubbe-meise
[16:06:25] <koollman> pyzozord: that was true of old charger designs. 'new' (like, 2010s or even earlier) won't have any problem with that
[16:06:28] <pyzozord> that's why it degradates because it's constantly under effort of charging and discharging
[16:07:16] <epony> no, it degrades due to the chemical decomposition, heat and internal corrosion
[16:07:22] <koollman> pyzozord: that's not the case anymore except for very cheap designs. I don't know any laptop still having that problem although I could be wrong
[16:07:25] <absentia> epony: that's not true
[16:07:30] <epony> it will happen regardless
[16:07:31] <absentia> it's the magic smoke leaking out of pores in the battery
[16:08:03] <epony> drying up of electrolyte affects capacitors too

[19:27:06] <xaltsc> And while a cons cell may not be lazy, creating a closure to iterate over it does the job
[19:30:48] <absentia> xaltsc: lazy evaluation (required for streaming or infinite inputs) will have impacts on your memory and performance profile

[19:41:49] <merijn> absentia: Pretty true

[19:44:01] <absentia> i hope you have a phd in abstract algebra

[19:44:53] <xaltsc> I'm not versed at all in compilation, to me "iterables" reffered to a data structure where you access elements sequentially (more or less FIFO) with methods/functions that allow for consuming elements as soon as they're queried.

[19:51:36] <FloridaMan> Assembly I expect to be
[19:51:39] *** Joins: Telvana (~capo@user/telvana)
[19:51:42] <merijn> 5 years ago Haskell wasn't slow either, and "fast as C" is kinda a pointless metric
[19:51:53] <merijn> Because what we're really discussing is the performance of an implementation
[19:52:24] <merijn> i.e. "GHC" vs "gcc" and how well code is written to suit them.
[19:52:47] <c2a1> FloridaMan: assembly is kind of C but less abstracted tho
[19:53:34] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> what
[19:53:54] <ejjfunky> i still can't code in Haskell.
[19:53:56] <xaltsc> There's been some criticism about Haskell being made for Category Theorists and devoting much of their effort to have a nice support for types instead of building fast executables. But yeah, I mean ghc vs gcc
[19:53:58] <c2a1> Meant to say C is more of an abstract version of assembly
[19:54:19] <merijn> xaltsc: I have heard that criticism, but I think it's nonsensical bollocks
[19:54:28] <merijn> Haskell is as based on category theory as C is >.>
[19:54:40] <xaltsc> what.
[19:54:51] <xaltsc> C doesn't have types
[19:54:54] <merijn> And I don't know how the meme that it is based on CT ever caught on, when it's so obviously false
[19:54:59] <ejjfunky> any practical reason as to why one will choose haskell?
[19:55:10] <xaltsc> ejjfunky: It's agreeable to use
[19:55:18] <merijn> ejjfunky: I find it the easiest/fastest language to work with
[19:55:47] <ejjfunky> merijn? really? i find it hardest. my brain doesn't suit using haskell
[19:55:55] <merijn> It is my "default" for all my own projects/problems, since it has the best "power to amount of effort" ratio
[19:56:07] <c2a1> xaltsc: C has types.
[19:56:20] <c2a1> What is int, short, and char?
[19:56:29] <Sqaure> ejjfunky, i feel im just more efficient in it. I tend to trust my own code more in than in a more loose language. And i feel i trust the library makers more too. 
[19:56:42] <merijn> ejjfunky: It takes a shift in how you program, and not everyone likes that way of programming, but for me the other alternative (e.g. python/ruby/JS) is just so painful and frustrating
[19:56:43] <xaltsc> c2a1: C has types in the same way prehistory had industry, if you count silex making industry
[19:57:01] <c2a1> What is an example of a language not based on category theory
[19:57:31] <merijn> c2a1: tbh, I'm not aware of any language that *is* based on CT
[19:57:34] <c2a1> xaltsc: what. C has types. Period
[19:57:45] <ejjfunky> merijn, interesting. python and ruby are so easy compare to c. haskell, i dont know. can't get a hang of it. yet.
[19:57:48] <merijn> At least, not anything remotely well-known
[19:57:52] <c2a1> Someone just said C is
[19:57:58] <absentia> ejjfunky: for writing a parser, haskell is state of the art
[19:58:01] <Thedarkb1-Deskto> If you think C has a shitty type system, have a look at B.
[19:58:15] <absentia> also if you want parallel and/or concurrent program with stronger static guarantees
[19:58:19] <[itchyjunk]> No language is based on category theory.
[19:58:19] <absentia> though rust is moving into this space as well
[19:58:32] <[itchyjunk]> But category theory has equivalence to type theory and such.
[19:58:36] <merijn> ejjfunky: I have a 130k LOC codebase in python. There's a line relevant to what I'm doing that has a method call, like "foo.bar(some, args, here)" I wanna know "wtf does bar do?" and finding out is hell
[19:58:43] <c2a1> How is C's type system shitty at all
[19:58:45] <[itchyjunk]> So you language might have categories.
[19:58:47] <c2a1> It just works
[19:58:49] <absentia> c2a1: (void*)
[19:58:54] <absentia> there isn't one
[19:58:54] <c2a1> And?
[19:58:58] <merijn> ejjfunky: You don't know what object/type "foo" is, you have no idea where "bar" comes from...it's just desperately grepping code

[19:59:16] <absentia> "these bytes are a u32 just take my word for it"
[19:59:18] <xaltsc> I mean, you can always interpret a language as a 2-category, but I guess the syntax makes it closer to CT or not. Vertical composition always exists and is very often visible, horizontal composition is less clear when you don't have a \circ operator
[19:59:18] <merijn> ejjfunky: In haskell I can query the types of all those things and easily search all functions that work on those types
[19:59:23] <absentia> pretty weak type system

[19:59:45] <absentia> ejjfunky: check out hoogle
[19:59:45] <merijn> You cannot convert function pointers to void* in portable C. That's a POSIX-specific extension

[20:00:00] <ejjfunky> absentia, hoogle?
[20:00:05] <f843d0> c2a1: void * is also simply used for type erasure
[20:00:07] <[itchyjunk]> but doesn't make it `category theory based`
[20:00:09] <absentia> in no other language am I aware of such tooling
[20:00:09] <merijn> c2a1: You can't convert to void* in hosted either

[20:00:33] <absentia> and if it did exist in other languages

[20:04:46] <bayaz> Title: (a -> Maybe b) -> [a] -> [b] - Hoogle 
[20:05:20] <xaltsc> [itchyjunk]: functors in math are the categorical equivalent of a linear map, F: C -> D maps objects to objects and functions linearly, i.e. F(f.g) = F(f).F(g) (so that, for instance F(1_o) = 1_(F(o))
[20:05:48] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: A Functor is: a type with kind '* -> *' (aka a parametic type that takes one type argument, like Maybe or a list). That type must support a function "fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b" (i.e. you can use a function 'a -> b' to turn an 'f a' into 'f b'

[20:07:31] <absentia> or is that not necessary
[20:07:34] <c2a1> I guess the meaning of type can go beyond data sizes. That is pretty self explanatory if You consider C even.
[20:07:42] <merijn> The type Maybe has the right shape (one type argument). We can define fmap for it. And fmap obeys the law that 'fmap id = id'

[20:09:52] <merijn> absentia: So the only way "fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f.g)" can "not hold" is, when your fmap implementation can selectively skip some of the elements (since structure isn't affected)
[20:09:54] <[itchyjunk]> (a -> b) "lifts to" (f a -> f b) ?

[20:10:27] <absentia> merijn: isn't such an implementation possible though
[20:10:28] <merijn> absentia: But the types don't allow for skipping some elements, it wouldn't type check, so you can assume all elements are effected equally and structure isn't affected

[21:24:18] <ash_worksi> do you separate consumers and producers that share data structures into different projects?

[21:26:31] <ash_worksi> I'm not sure what defines atomicity standing this far back looking at a project
[21:26:38] <ash_worksi> maybe transaction boundaries?
[21:26:53] <EdFletcher> yup that's what i use most often 
[21:27:06] <ash_worksi> so that kind if lends itself to microservices?
[21:27:12] <EdFletcher> interface boundaries as a broad category

[21:30:18] <ash_worksi> anyway, so, in a simple example, a producer generating a new user message with an object whose prototype is a user class; then would you share a library between your producer and consumer defining the class? 
[21:30:20] <pulse> the problem with microservices is they perform worse than monolithic equivalents
[21:30:35] <pulse> the tradeoff then seems to be customizability and adaptability vs performance
[21:31:36] <ash_worksi> I don't want to start a mircoservices war; I just want to see how people "tend to do things" since I am undecided if abstracting workers at this point is a good idea
[21:31:49] <EdFletcher> ash_worksi: you don't need necessarily share a library depending on how you define your shared data shapes, it may just be an interface they share. or you can go so far as to define a full IDL and serialization library they share based in protobufs or thrift or something. 
[21:31:57] <nomagno> pulse: That's not necessarily a huge issue in a well-architectured systems. See the mach kernel, which has had successful forks as well as unsuccessful ones.
[21:32:14] <pulse> well, it's not necessarily an issue, but that's typically the tradeoff
[21:32:24] <EdFletcher> yeah was just going to say that, it is true they tend to underperform but as long as the system is well-designed that generally isn't a problem per se 
[21:32:33] <pulse> you either sacrifice customizability or perf, then it's up to you how good you implement your architecture. the better the implementation the lower the sacrifice
[21:32:42] <EdFletcher> but yeah definitely a tradeoff and a good one to enumerate here 
[21:32:43] <pulse> EdFletcher, yeah

[21:33:18] <nomagno> NeXTSTeP -> XNU was pretty successful mach fork, and GNU Hurd was fairly unsuccessful, possibly related to early +
[21:33:30] <nomagno> to early mistakes + lack of interest
[21:34:03] <koollman> not just lack of interest, I would say lack of ... focus. or lack of resolution to get something out quickly
[21:34:33] <koollman> for the little time I followed what gnu hurd was doing, I remember at least two full redesigns of the capabilities system, and a change of micro-kernel
[21:34:44] <EdFletcher> wow Hurd is still (technically) going? i hadn't heard about it in so long i just assumed it had died for lack of progress (sounds like it effectively has, but the website is still up!) 
[21:35:00] <ash_worksi> the main point I am trying to get at is just that in that paradigm, 1 repo becomes 3 given you need to at minimum, share an interface

[21:36:54] <nomagno> The name is a double pun
[21:37:53] <EdFletcher> ash_worksi: NS was the predecessor to Mac OS and XNU is the name of the kernel that runs within Mac OS to this day: https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/ 
[21:37:54] <bayaz> Title: Source Browser 
[21:37:56] <ash_worksi> I guess it should be pronounced, "no.ma.nyo" -ish
[21:38:23] <nomagno> 'Not Magnus' in Spanish ('Not Great'). Also Nomagno -> Gnome The Great. It was originally 'NomagnoIsNotDead', so it can be taken (following its original meaning) to mean 'The great Gnome, who is actually fairly crappy, has surprisingly not died'.

[21:51:04] <sonny> is https all you need to implement secure messaging?
[21:51:33] <koollman> depends what you mean by 'secure'
[21:51:33] <nomagno> EdFletcher: I personally like to have a single monolithic project with clear separation. The idea is all related modules if a project are colected in one place, but there's not more than 1-2 folders to copy to get the standalone thingy
[21:52:08] <nomagno> The messaging will be secure insofar as only the involved parties can read it.
[21:52:16] <EdFletcher> ash_worksi: Keeping it simple, the “minimal viable project”, is definitely the right way to go at first. You’re very welcome, have fun with it! 
[21:52:59] <nomagno> If a module gets big enough to guarantee its own project, I'll probably not have much trouble sending it off

[22:32:23] <absentia> no you're steve jobs
[22:32:25] <absentia> literally steve jobs
[22:32:25] <apotheon> You can have your sealed, black box tech, I guess.  I want something that serves me, rather than demanding I serve it.
[22:32:26] <ProfSimm> Yes!

[22:33:11] <pulse> which is just flawed reasoning

[22:33:36] <pulse> i ... uh, wouldn't call webkit a good thing
[22:33:49] <apotheon> No, WebKit came from KDE.
[22:33:55] <apotheon> Apple just made a fork.

[22:34:15] <nomagno> ... There are different names for the same major thingy everywhere. CS, SE, IE...
[22:34:22] <apotheon> They kinda did.  Large parts of KHTML were copyleft.

[22:34:31] <pulse> chrome is like a baseball card, depends what angle you look at it
[22:34:31] <ProfSimm> Well we all agree it's a mixed bag. But it's better than Netscape and IE so

[22:35:27] <nomagno> it's a trully vanilla browser engine

[22:36:28] <apotheon> nomagno: WebKit only looks good because Gecko died.
[22:36:35] <apotheon> Before that, Gecko was much better.
[22:36:45] <apotheon> Mozilla killed that shit, and is now paying the price.
[22:36:54] <ProfSimm> They died because they keep focusing on stupid features

[22:37:23] <absentia> ProfSimm: yes i agree
[22:37:24] <apotheon> Mozilla lost the race because it killed Gecko as a distinct codebase.  It now has no way to compete head-to-head with Chrome.
[22:37:25] <absentia> and the rust foundation
[22:37:55] <apotheon> Mozilla got too cocky, and thought "We're basically at the top, now.  We should stop enabling people to compete with our own code."
[22:37:56] <nomagno> ... It's so hard to meet a CS student nowadays! I want to have half++ the content already assimilated by the time I get there
[22:38:05] <apotheon> . . . then Chrome bypassed Firefox, and the rest is history.
[22:38:08] <absentia> is it?
[22:38:16] <absentia> i thought everyone and their dog was chomping at the bit to get into CS
[22:38:17] <ProfSimm> absentia: maybe one day Rust will die, but before that they'll have spun off a 3D animation software, or an AI or a popular lifestyle food blender. You never know with those guys.

[22:38:56] <absentia> nomagno: you may need to camp by the fridge where they keep the mountain dew at the corner store

[22:39:20] <ProfSimm> In Twitter, the latest tweet is on top, is this wrong in your opinion. Given we write/read chronologically top to bottom
[22:39:28] <nomagno> Here it is called 'Informatics Engineering'
[22:39:39] <nomagno> Unfortunate name, same in Spanish as in French and other languages, very non-descriptive
[22:39:41] <absentia> in some circles, you can `npm install` someone else's compiler, write a CLI interface to it
[22:39:47] <absentia> and proudly boast to your colleagues "i wrote a compiler"
[22:39:59] <absentia> "huh? what's a backus-naur form?"
[22:41:16] <nomagno> ProfSimm: There aren't many other good options. An IRC/chat-like layout would make you have to conciously pick a starting point then read down. This way, starting at the top, you don't have to.
[22:41:28] <nomagno> You can just jump around tweets
[22:41:35] <nomagno> the idea is most tweets are qasi-independent

[22:43:33] <apotheon> ProfSimm: Twitter isn't optimized for chronological reading except in the case of threads.  That's by design.
[22:43:46] <apotheon> ProfSimm: If you want the timeline chronological, you're not using it as designed.

[22:46:06] <apotheon> They're designed with an assumption of static HTML as the base-state of any page.

[23:35:00] <bayaz> Title: My first impressions of web3 
[23:35:05] <apotheon> It doesn't solve the Byzantine general problem.  It just gamifies looking for things.
[23:35:22] <GeDaMo> "So much work, energy, and time has gone into creating a trustless  distributed consensus mechanism, but virtually all clients that wish to  access it do so by simply trusting the outputs from these two companies  without any further verification."
[23:35:49] <sonny> yeah, that is an accurate description
[23:36:33] * sonny looks up byzantine generals
[23:36:59] <apotheon> Unfortunately, there are some broken incentives in the ways various blockchains do things.  Monero is one of a very, very select few that actually work to keep the incentives focused on trustlessness as the outcome.
[23:37:36] <ProfSimm> Trustless protocols all end up like this. It's also like social networks. "Let's not have open protocols, let's have a richer space of many competing companies" Result: 1-2 winners emerge and control the entire market with closed protocols
[23:37:48] <apotheon> The two most immediately obvious things Monero has that keep those incentives in check are RandomX and P2Pool.
[23:37:51] <deniska> sonny: the problem is to maintain a distributed database, in which each participant is inherently incentivized to cheat
[23:38:06] <sonny> apotheon: I have not used a trusted central party, where did I go wrong?
[23:38:09] <deniska> sonny: proof of work solves this problem by essentially making cheating really computationally expensive
[23:38:20] <ProfSimm> Can't we have digital notaries.
[23:38:29] <apotheon> The CCS proposal system for motivating development also keeps the eyes of developers on the prize of keeping it trustless.
[23:38:31] <GeDaMo> Certificate authorities?
[23:38:33] <ProfSimm> And we can distribute data to a network of them. 
[23:38:57] <apotheon> sonny: How are you creating the target locations?

[23:50:29] <apotheon> It's best to have something that survives a long time, else nobody will want to use it.
[23:50:49] <pyzozord> you can get rich relatively reliably by selling shovels during a gold rush
[23:50:58] <pyzozord> I just haven't figured out what kind of shovels are needed
[23:51:04] <sonny> in a pramagtic sense that can be achieved by allocating a lot of objects
[23:51:18] <apotheon> Nobody wants to receive "value" in something valueless, and with a short lifespan the only people who won't regard it as valueless are those with a short enough time horizon to not realize they're getting screwed.
[23:51:21] <pyzozord> and it's too obvious, many smarter and sharper people had that idea for many years now I suppose

[23:52:23] <InPhase> I contemplated buying into bitcoin long ago, but underestimated the public's capacity to recognize a currency that could not function well as a currency.
[23:52:50] <apotheon> I'm fine with the idea that things like currencies should evolve, change, and sometimes die.  I'm not okay with them having a short, necessarily finite lifetime, where no matter what people do it will eventually reach a hard-end point with catastrophic currency death for anyone still holding it.
[23:52:53] <user51> does bitcoin have much in common with dotocm?
[23:53:03] <InPhase> It goes on my long list of correct conclusions about a thing which were simultanouesly strategically incorrect.
[23:53:38] <InPhase> s/simultanouesly/simultaneously/
[23:53:45] <apotheon> InPhase: The fundamentals were good, but the evolution of BTC itself has taken a sharp turn into trashville.

[23:54:29] <apotheon> Those are implementation details, though, not the fundamentals of it.
[23:54:53] <InPhase> Seemed pretty fundamental to me in my early evaluation.
[23:54:59] <apotheon> The community/blockchain split with BCH was about whether to fix the problems or make them worse.

[23:55:07] <ProfSimm> apotheon: notaries are legislated
[23:55:19] <apotheon> ProfSimm: depends on your context
[23:55:25] <ProfSimm> apotheon: well I think they have to be
[23:55:27] <apotheon> Some people say "rights" are legislated, too.
[23:55:29] <sonny> apotheon: would you rather the currency being devalued being built in or due to external factors
[23:55:45] <apotheon> ProfSimm: A certified public notary in the US is subject to legislation that way.
[23:55:58] <apotheon> . . . but informal notaries exist in various forms and contexts, too.
[23:56:02] <ProfSimm> apotheon: there are scammer notaries, but they're rare. And if you make them redundant, then the odds of scams falls even more.

[23:56:08] <InPhase> apotheon: I figured in my initial evaluation that a split was unlikely to work well, because once people realized you could make all sorts of digital currencies and split them off, the core value of any one digital currency would plummet.  Although, again, this does not seem to have quite been the case yet.
[23:56:11] <apotheon> I'm not talking about scams.
[23:56:54] <apotheon> InPhase: It's not necessarily true that all would suffer overmuch.  In time, one might emerge "winner".  Depending on circumstances, one might emerge "winner" immediately.
[23:57:02] <sonny> as for implementation, it seems like a distributed OS would make it much easier
[23:57:11] <sonny> or at least a distributed protocol
[23:57:18] <InPhase> apotheon: Like how myspace emerged a winner.
[23:57:24] <apotheon> har
[23:57:29] <apotheon> That's not the same thing at all.
[23:57:34] <InPhase> Isn't it?
[23:57:38] <apotheon> nope
[23:57:43] <InPhase> Community agreement to make a thing the standard place...
[23:57:49] <apotheon> So?
[23:57:49] <InPhase> Which lasts as long as that community agreement.
[23:57:58] <InPhase> And it can apparently be quite fickle.
[23:58:03] <InPhase> People love the latest and greatest.
[23:58:27] <apotheon> The "standard place" is a vacant lot scam.
