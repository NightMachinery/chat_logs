[02:53:58] <ljharb> banana_: tbh you don't sound like you're describing games and politics, you sound like you're describing "social interaction"
[02:54:05] <banana_> the motivation why people play politics is prevent themselves from getting fired.
[02:54:07] <ljharb> like, the normal way humans interact
[02:54:11] <ljharb> banana_: no, it's not
[02:54:23] <banana_> ljharb: shhh
[02:54:25] <banana_> jk
[02:54:25] <ljharb> plenty of people work jobs without being afraid of being fired
[02:54:30] * banana_ bows
[02:54:40] <banana_> show deference to my coding superiors
[02:54:48] <ljharb> i'd say if you operate with that kind of fear, your problem isn't politics, it's either the work culture, or you, or both
[02:55:06] <banana_> ljharb: social interactions
[02:55:09] <ljharb> but "learning how to work with people" isn't "politics"
[02:55:10] <banana_> like making friends etc?
[02:55:29] <ljharb> i mean it's similar, but your colleagues aren't your friends
[02:55:36] <banana_> i 100% disagree
[02:55:38] <ljharb> (necessarily)
[02:55:41] <banana_> 1000%
[02:55:45] <ljharb> lol in what sense
[02:55:58] <ljharb> i'm not saying you can't be friends with your colleagues, i'm saying a friendship isn't built on merely working together
[02:56:20] <banana_> I also think playing politics is an answer to "how to work with people" when youre playing a game of limited resources
[02:57:44] <ljharb> it's very weird to treat life and your job as a game
[02:58:05] <ljharb> certainly you can be manipulative and "play politics". it's *an* answer. but it's not a normal one, a typical one, or tbh, an ethical one
[02:58:12] <ljharb> it's also not the most effective one.

[02:59:11] <ljharb> but that doesn't mean you need to do whatever it takes not to get fired
[02:59:17] <ljharb> it means that you need to be sure you have a job
[02:59:25] <KevinX> if you feel that way now then you should start working on finding a new place of employment now
[02:59:36] <ljharb> which doesn't in any way require keeping your current job. people are hiring devs everywhere.
[02:59:50] <banana_> ljharb: why not you need money to live anymore, what about paying the mortgage
[03:00:03] <ljharb> banana_: of course, in capitalism you need money to live. but *getting a new job is easy*
[03:00:08] <ljharb> banana_: thus, you shouldn't fear losing your current job.
[03:00:19] <banana_> who ever made the rule you need money to have a roof over your head is the bad guy
[03:00:21] <KevinX> adn you should start saving up a 6 month emergency fund
[03:00:23] <ljharb> also, if you're not fired for cause, you'll get severance.
[03:00:32] <ljharb> (depending on where you live and the laws there, ofc)
[03:00:43] <banana_> im just protecting myself and still working for a living being as useful as I can be but still productive

[03:02:48] <ljharb> banana_: and "fired for cause" doesn't include "the boss doesn't like you"
[03:02:56] <banana_> so I play politics to guard myself from getting fired. but then you play politics too, or not and get screwed, possibly but usually the other party in a game plays it too.

[03:23:06] <ljharb> i'm arguing a few things. one is that the term "politics" has a common connotation of being unjust. the other is that i'm arguing that most people *don't actually do that* to keep their jobs.
[03:23:16] <ljharb> i also argued that it's not the most effective way to keep your job.
[03:23:17] <banana_> but what about at a coding job somewhere if you had played politics you couldve influenced the company to value good coding standards

[08:10:53] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm working my way through the official React tutorial. I have a question about this code. Specifically line 41: http://pastie.org/p/6hGpFqEIzd3dDOlFKu0KAk
[08:11:08] <bobdobbs> where does 'this' point?
[08:11:39] <bobdobbs> Does it point to the properties of 'Square'? Or does it point to Board ?
[08:13:09] <Maxdamantus> !this @ bobdobbs
[08:13:09] <jellobot> bobdobbs, A function call of the form `a.b()` calls the function with `this` being the value of `a`; in a call of the form `f()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. Note that arrow functions and functions produced by `Function.prototype.bind` ignore the passed `this` value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[08:13:43] <Maxdamantus> bobdobbs: since it's being called as `this.renderSquare(1)` from `render`, it will have `this` as the same value as `this` in `render`.
[08:14:01] *** Quits: kNyne (~kNyne@2600:6c48:6c7f:dc45:5d39:944f:c3ec:2c9d) (Quit: Client closed)
[08:14:01] <Maxdamantus> Which will be the `Board` instance.
[08:14:06] *** Joins: kristijonas (~kristijon@78-56-32-39.static.zebra.lt)
[08:14:41] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[08:16:12] <bobdobbs> Maxdamantus: is it normal for that to make my brain hurt?
[08:16:14] <Maxdamantus> If you want to control how each `Square` renders itself, you'll need to pass something in. For example, a function that renders the state. `Square.render` would have to then invoke that function.
[08:16:59] <Maxdamantus> Actually, looks like you're already wanting it to be the `this` value that it is.
[08:17:16] <Maxdamantus> bobdobbs: probably, at first.
[08:17:38] <Maxdamantus> bobdobbs: just remember that `this.state.square[i]` is a regular JavaScript expression being evaluated in the `renderSquare` function.
[08:18:52] <Maxdamantus> bobdobbs: if React didn't bother with JSX, it would just look something like: `return Square({ value: this.state.square[i] });`
[08:19:52] <Maxdamantus> The actual translation of the JSX you've written is something like: return React.createElement(Square, { value: this.state.square[i] });
[08:20:49] <theskillwithin> there is no this.state.square
[08:20:56] <theskillwithin> looks like theres a this.state.squares tho
[08:21:06] <Maxdamantus> Yeah, that might help.

[11:31:16] <ThePendulum> for most intents and purposes they work the same if you're not using `this`
[11:32:25] <ThePendulum> they inherit their `this` context from the parent scope, rather than having their own

[12:32:33] <Maxdamantus> I'm wary of using magnets around electronics.
[12:32:51] <Maxdamantus> and velcro isn't very good for sliding.

[12:33:26] <skillbot> YouTube Title: Breaking Bad: Yeah, bitch! Magnets!
[12:34:22] <hmw[at]> Maxdamantus: Only change in the magnetic field could pose a risk. A permanent magnet, especially such weak ones, will do exactly nothing to a computer
[12:35:10] <hmw[at]> It would be a weird hack anyways. I guess 3d printing a custom case might be an option tho.
[12:36:10] <hmw[at]> I'd not put a magnet directly on a hard drive platter.
[12:36:22] <theskillwithin> evulish sorry i don't have much experience deploying docker
[12:36:26] <Maxdamantus> hmw[at]: change in the magnetic field is only required to induce current. A static magnetic field still has an effect on electronics. Dunno how much, but I imagine it could be significant.
[12:36:38] <Maxdamantus> hmw[at]: have you ever held a magnet up to a CRT?
[12:36:46] <Maxdamantus> (CRT display, that is)
[12:37:02] <hmw[at]> We don't use CRTs anymore
[12:37:28] <Maxdamantus> Sure, but the effect of static magnetic fields on CRTs is demonstrative.
[12:37:30] <hmw[at]> I used magnetized screw drivers for hard drives for decades. I did the math. It is safe to put a magnet on a smart phone.
[12:38:02] <hmw[at]> However, it would not work very well anywasy
[12:39:05] <Maxdamantus> Hard drives are built as big Faraday cages. And you usually use screwdrivers on them when they're off. And they are internally already designed to work with voltages that are probably not going to be disturbed by magnets, since they've already got magnets inside them.
[12:39:37] <hmw[at]> Hm. I would not recommend putting a phone inside a MRT scanner, because of potential mechanical damage
[12:39:46] <Maxdamantus> Phones are not designed as big Faraday cages, and I intend to use the keyboard while it's on, and they're designed to work with voltages as low as possible.
[12:39:58] <theskillwithin> btw this is sort of a support channel, and I feel like we may have skated over someones question

[12:41:02] <Maxdamantus> (because lower voltage means less power draw which means it will last longer on a battery, not really a concern with harddrives, which normally draw somewhere in the order of 10 W when idle. I imagine that's something like twice the power that a phone would draw under load)

[12:42:07] <hmw[at]> Perhaps some of the similar products to the N900, that are allegedly available now, are for you.
[12:42:55] <Maxdamantus> I was considering ordering an f(x)tec pro 1, but that seems like a gamble, and it doesn't really seem like a sustainable upgrade path, since the hardware they're using is already a few years old.

[12:43:22] <hmw[at]> The N900 did not use Android, but a proper Linux distro, which was the neat thing about it
[12:43:32] <Maxdamantus> (seemed like a gamble because afaics, lots of people had had them preordered for a year or so with no delivery)

[12:45:28] <hmw[at]> There is (or was) also an attempt at making one "open source" via croudfunding, but I fear that project is dead. It would have been abhorrently expensive too.
[12:45:32] <Maxdamantus> Indeed. Hotelling's law has carried out and we're now stuck in a Nash equilibrium where every manufacture is just optimising the same dumb form factory.

[14:56:49] <Maxdamantus> The idea is that if someone wants to "scale text" through their browser, using rem makes it so that the entire UI scales, which basically makes "scale text" and "zoom" mean the same thing.

[23:13:41] <ljharb> an IDE does too much. most of that's what the command line is for.
