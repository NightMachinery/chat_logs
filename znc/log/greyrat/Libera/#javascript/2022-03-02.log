[01:15:00] <DPA> Is the error on the server side, or on the client side? Have you tried putting the script defining player befor the view.js? And does the error not contain a stack trace / line number?

[02:28:38] <bn_mobile> ljharb: the .JS or .HTM(L) is _hosted_ on a webserver but actual execution would be in the browser JS engine, ex:  v8, etc. ?
[02:29:21] <bn_mobile> after the resource loads
[02:30:03] <austincheney> bn_mobile, yes, in 99% of cases that is how the web works.  You connect to a server, download front-end assets, and then the browser executes those assets.

[02:30:31] <bn_mobile> ljharb / systemfault :  but CORS requires the server to participate and specify if it allows  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * | my domain` ?   Or you're saying if it doesn't , the browser is the one that implements the restriction?
[02:31:22] <austincheney> bn_mobile, the primary security model of the browser is single origin policy.  CORS bypasses that policy if the appropriate header is in the page's HTTP response headers
[02:31:38] <systemfault> bn_mobile: It's up to the HTTP client to implement the restriction... browsers do, a command line client, like cURL, doesn't
[02:31:39] <austincheney> that means the security exception is known and granted from the server
[02:32:21] <bn_mobile> I guess I don't understand the motivation of CORS, posts on it mention things about other (malicious) domains requesting resources from one's bank or GMail, but wouldn't that be locked behind a token or authentication requirement?
[02:32:43] <austincheney> bn_mobile, the motivation of CORS is to allow a bypass of single origin policy

[02:34:37] <bn_mobile> austincheney: right, I guess technically CORS is a mechanism to allow cross-origin requests, I guess it's the single-domain restriction default that is puzzling to me

[02:35:16] <ljharb> bn_mobile: otherwise you visiting my website could access your bank's backend and steal all your money
[02:35:21] <austincheney> bn_mobile, the motivation behind single-origin policy is to prevent third party code for beaconing all your preferences to a malicious third party

[02:37:53] <ljharb> bn_mobile: ajax requests automatically use cookies
[02:38:07] <ljharb> bn_mobile: so if you're logged in to your bank, every request sent to your bank's backend is already logged in
[02:38:18] <ljharb> bn_mobile: which would mean other websites can act as you, as long as you load them

[02:42:08] <average> ljharb: and is that a polo t-shirt ?
[02:42:21] <bn_mobile> ljharb: right, but aren't cookies sandboxed between domains?  ie:  I can't access another domain's cookies from my JS code
[02:42:23] <austincheney> bn_mobile, go to any major commercial site and look at all the garbage that gets sourced into the page, because marketing teams demand it.
[02:42:37] <austincheney> bn_mobile, most of that is spyware for analytics
[02:42:46] <bn_mobile> usually most sites require some token to be sent post authentication
[02:43:03] <austincheney> bn_mobile, common vectors for (intentionally) malicious script are advertisements

[02:59:32] <bn_mobile> so restrict 3rd-party cookies to only work with the domain from which it was generated with?  vs restricting the actual request itself??
[02:59:59] <jaawerth> well that's one issue. I believe there are a number of reasons it became as strict as it is over time, though. another one is it makes it harder to use random people browsing by sites into DDoSing a random target API

[03:04:53] <bn_mobile> jaawerth:  do most servers bother to set that though?

[03:06:38] <bn_mobile> jaawerth: it seems weird for a web service to _not_ set it?  but perhaps it doesn't consider browser clients to be coming from a domain?

[10:31:56] <banana_> ah
[10:31:56] <ljharb> Intelo: the more stuff you shove into the same file, the more likely people are to only need a subset of it. and treeshaking is only a half-assed way to try to clean that up later.
[10:32:07] <Intelo> ljharb well sometimes a file may have just 2 functions. So should I make a separate file for each funciton?
[10:32:09] <banana_> a BE vs CONTAINS
[10:32:10] <theskillwithin> you can do import myDefault, { a, b, c } from 'foo'    to combine default and named imports if the module has both

[10:46:10] <ljharb> it's not a react-based preference

[10:46:31] <ljharb> KevinX: i'm saying that there's important semantic information lost if you make everything a named export
[10:46:36] <banana_> I would just learn enough regex for the bigger picture

[10:47:15] <KevinX> im also thinking in react, so i woulnd't think of them as modules but components. Maybe that's a subtle enough difference
[10:47:22] <systemfault> When working with React, having a file per component makes SO MUCH SENSE
[10:47:42] <ljharb> systemfault: i don't think it is. i do it in practice and it works great, for non-react especially

[10:47:58] <ljharb> systemfault: to be fair tho i don't often have pairs of things like that, and when i do, i would likely put them in the same file
[10:48:53] <ljharb> but generally speaking, i'd say that it's actually a bad design to have more than one related thing. a get/set pair can easily be one function; open can be a function that returns the "close" function, etc.
[10:50:21] <banana_> ljharb: oh really for pairs of things
[10:50:30] <Intelo> ljharb so in this, basically you have just grouped few functions related to parsers.

[12:20:20] <ThePendulum> I do think I will probe for a raise once we've launched or next production site
[12:20:33] <theskillwithin> i feel like you could pheasabily work in a coffee shop and make 20
[12:20:51] <ThePendulum> well especially in the netherlands
[12:21:14] <theskillwithin> ThePendulum how much is your rent?
[12:21:18] <blueagain> minimum wage here is 12 euro.
[12:21:49] <blueagain> that's before taxes, but you're unlikely to pay much taxes if you earn the minimum.

[12:22:40] <ThePendulum> that in part also makes me reluctant to charge more

[14:42:53] <pavonia> rendar: Every input box? There's the "focus" event which triggers if an element gets the focus
[14:43:10] <rendar> yes my problem is that i have a div and an input box
[14:43:24] <rendar> if i click the div the inputbox loses the focus, and viceversa
[14:43:32] <rendar> but if i click the page, both gets the focus!
[14:43:43] <rendar> so my keyboard inputs goes to bot input and div!
[14:43:47] <rendar> how can i stop this?

[14:46:01] <rendar> no, that's not the issue :/

[14:48:01] <Decker> ya... keydown keeps going to all handlers unless something tells it to stop; if you have multiple andlers; it doesn't kow if A is like watching WASD and B is watching 'escape' or something...

[19:18:56] <ThePendulum> yeah there is nothing in the range slider itself that actually shows what range it's for, so I'd just map the value before displaying it
[19:19:42] <ThePendulum> or do you need the gaps to change width?

[20:14:14] <stenno> here you see the word 'inline'. This specifically means <div onclick='inline js'...>

[20:16:22] <stenno> You can bind only one event of each kind with on*-style events , so you can't have two onclick event handlers, for example.
[20:16:40] <stenno> this is what i said earlier: document.onclick = ... will override any existing click handlers
[20:16:55] <stenno> point 3 is also not relevant

[20:17:44] <stenno> its a gray area

[20:17:55] <banana_> you're limited how many event handlers you can register

[20:28:41] <banana_> "The simplest way to register an event handler is by setting a property of the event target to the desired event handler function. By convention, event handler properties have names that consist of the word “on” followed by the event name: onclick, onchange, onload, onmouseover, and so on. Note that these property names are case sensitive and are written in all lowercase, even when the event type (such as “readystatechange” c

[20:46:57] <stenno> ok here more specific: you can have one event handler, but you can have multiple event listeners
[20:47:15] <stenno> friend: so what i said before about the difference between handlers and listeners is not true
[20:47:50] <banana_> so when you use addEventListener is an EventListener objected created internally with your handler?

[20:50:29] <stenno> even for me as a layperson regarding all the technical aspects can often understand
[20:50:42] <banana_> being the event handler specified by passing the function in addEventListener(...)
[20:51:03] <stenno> that is 'callback' here

[20:55:59] <jellobot> onosendi, Using ".onclick", ".onchange", or "on" anything is bad practice and results in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code; as well as limiting you to one event listener per event.

[20:56:56] <banana_> so youre saying you can set multiple event handlers on the same event type and target

[20:58:17] *** Quits: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:58:23] <stenno> you can set multiple event listeners of the same type

[20:58:30] *** Joins: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k)
[20:58:46] <banana_> and the type prop-value means event type right?
[20:59:26] <stenno> foo.addEventListener('click', () => ...) _adds_ an eventlistener which consists of callback for the event type 'click'
[20:59:47] <banana_> stenno: can "you can set multiple event listeners of the same type" be correctly rephrased to "you can register multiple event handlers on the same event type"
[20:59:49] <stenno> so if i execute addEventListener twice, with two different callbacks, they both will be triggered
[21:00:15] <banana_> I get that, also the order matters when calling addEventListner

[21:00:44] *** Joins: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k)
[21:00:46] <stenno> Many objects can have event handlers specified. These act as non-capture event listeners for the object on which they are specified. [DOM]
[21:01:07] <banana_> the first invocation of addEventListener if done on the same element and a subsequent addEventListener with same type will be invoked first
[21:01:30] <banana_> as a subsequent addEventListener(...)*
[21:01:35] <stenno> so 'setting an event handler' means: remove all existing listeners to the event type, add a single eventlistener for that event type

[21:03:04] <stenno> doing el.addEL('click', ...); el.onclick = ...; el.addEL('click', ...);, when you click the event, it will execute the callback provided to el.onclick and the following, but not the one registered first

[21:40:08] <NinjaKirby> Ah, I was thinking also interrogating the initial few characters of every other 2nd element, if it begins with 'http' or something, and then correct the loop variable. Bit risky though, I see your pickle now...

[21:45:26] <codebam> I like the new MDN, contrary to what other people are telling me
[21:45:37] <codebam> the dark theme is nice
[21:45:48] <onosendi> Agreed. Dark theme is a nice welcome.
[21:45:48] <stenno> they support prefer-color-scheme now? so thats nice in any case

[21:58:10] <EdFletcher> your eyes are different from mine: light mode is the most eye-hurting way possible, not dark.
[21:58:27] <EdFletcher> especially as screens grow in overall (nit) brightness
[21:58:28] <pulse> yeah i'm the opposite
[21:58:40] <EdFletcher> interesting!
[21:58:43] <pulse> dark mode leaves imprints on my retina
[21:58:44] <EdFletcher> you're lucky, honestly
[21:58:51] <pulse> i can look at a bright wall and see the damn website on it
[21:58:59] <pulse> i just prefer light themes everywhere

[21:59:55] <pulse> just lower brightness?
[21:59:56] <ljharb> dark mode has lower contrast, it's not as accessible
[22:00:02] <ljharb> i never use dark mode
[22:00:05] <EdFletcher> pulse: naw i need it up because of the bad eyesight
[22:00:13] <ljharb> EdFletcher: you can't just turn down the brightness?
[22:00:18] <ljharb> ah
[22:00:23] <EdFletcher> yeah it's not great
[22:00:30] <ljharb> EdFletcher: lol well then you should prefer higher contrast, which is what light mode gives you
[22:00:36] <EdFletcher> hence why i said pulse is lucky (as are you ljharb)
[22:00:47] <EdFletcher> ljharb: yup in fact i use dark-mode high-contrast every where it's available
[22:00:47] <pulse> i feel i have to squint to read white on black text
[22:00:54] <pulse> whereas black on white feels much more natural

[22:01:08] <ljharb> i'm glad it's becoming more of an option
[22:01:13] <ljharb> as long as nobody forces it on me
[22:01:21] <EdFletcher> yup true, it should never be the default!
[22:01:26] <ljharb> i will say that at night, on a phone/tablet, i often use light mode but with the screen inverted
[22:01:42] <ljharb> but inverting the screen looks terrible on anything else

[23:22:19] <mikrosis> hi!
[23:22:27] <mikrosis> anyone here with some react-query experience? :)
[23:22:40] <mikrosis> I want to use useQuery - but also useState for params
[23:22:55] <mikrosis> e.g. the app gets the param "categorySlug" and should set the category as state - and also run the useQuery
[23:22:57] <mikrosis> not sure how to do this

[23:50:05] <DPA> I haven't been on stackoverflow in years now. And I never used code from there. Or anything really. I just don't need it. It's all just empty answares, not wrong, but not useful either.

[23:51:34] <DPA> Understand all parts involved, and you already know all answares. The why is more important than the how.
[23:51:43] <onosendi> Sayona: you can use template literals too.
