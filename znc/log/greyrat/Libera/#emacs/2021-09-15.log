[00:04:13] <Bayes> I was gonna suggest writing the logs in html format (which sounds weird AF) but then I realized it's easy for a human to read but orders of magnitude harder to parse
[00:04:46] <_dave> Bayes: parsing it sounds like a job for libxml or nokogiri.
[00:04:59] <Bayes> oh indeed, it's dommable for sure
[00:05:08] <bpalmer> there are html parsers for most languages, although xml or xhtml are even easier.
[00:05:08] <grym> ndjson logs, that'll do 'er 
[00:05:31] <Bayes> but I prefer keeping logs simpler, maybe just plain text files that could hopefully be easy to parse or grep
[00:05:49] <_dave> wasn't there some plaintext format for logs that i can't remember the name of that people go on about?
[00:06:05] <grym> speaking of jq, jq-mode is pretty nice 
[00:06:15] <grym> jq-interactively is very fun 
[00:06:35] <_dave> problem is that everyone thinks whitespace is a massive waste of space in json.
[00:07:01] <grym> well, that's what jq is for... 
[00:07:17] <Bayes> _dave oh I'm curious now if there's a "standard" format for logs that's not just writing text to a text file
[00:07:22] <_dave> meh to be fair at least postman does that at dayjob, inc.
[00:07:22] <grym> _dave: i did actually hose myself with json whitespace once, too
[00:07:31] <Bayes> something that's both somewhat human readable and machine readable at the same time o_O
[00:08:24] <Bayes> I don't dare use sed
[00:08:25] <_dave> Bayes: i swear there was one format, even where it had an IETF RFC, but i can't remember the name of it and i can'
[00:08:39] <_dave> and i can't find it through my crummy internet searching "skills".
[00:09:44] <_dave> Bayes: actually, i wonder if it's syslog now i found something tangentially related to it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog
[00:11:15] <_dave> oh wait you said "not just writing text to a text file"... but i think some of this is related to a protocol in particular which is odd but may be up your alley.
[00:11:17] <johnjay> json seems to solve the "make something human and also machine readable at once" problem

[00:12:33] <_dave> johnjay: because sadly the world doesn't run on lisp.
[00:12:46] <johnjay> sure. but surely they're easier to parse than xml
[00:13:14] <_dave> even parsing is way beyond me to get right yet i'm doing enterprise telecom java backend mumbo jumbo. go figure.
[00:13:16] <johnjay> also easier to learn than XMLQueryNotificationSchemaValidate
[00:14:01] <bpalmer> S-expressions aren't really standard in the way that XML is.
[00:14:24] <muradm> may be anyone does (setq sendmail-program "exim") here?
[00:14:32] <_dave> rumor has it you can even style XML files so if you include that in an rss/atom feed, you can make it look pretty.
[00:14:45] <bpalmer> Accordingly, XML is by far more straightforward to parse, because the corner cases are actually specified and probably already implemented for you.
[00:15:12] <muradm> my messages are get sent successfully, but emacs says error
[00:15:22] <Bayes> johnjay is json easily greppable tho? or are you thinking of using something like jq?
[00:15:25] <muradm> probably due to output of exim
[00:15:49] <johnjay> no i just don't understand the problem of "make something human and machine readable at once"
[00:15:50] <_dave> Bayes: if you grep on most json you might end up with a hit on the whole bloody thing because whitespace gets omitted a lot of times.
[00:15:55] <johnjay> apparently it's so bad xml exists
[00:16:12] <_dave> at least emmet exists if you have to write xml.

[00:18:05] <_dave> but guess grep is more of a verb for "search" now so i'm a dum dum.
[00:18:06] <rpav> i mean, would you use od on a text file?
[00:18:10] <Bayes> last time I used json I felt I was waste too many bytes for some reason

[00:21:38] <grym> yaml has a problem and that problem is norway 
[00:21:47] <Bayes> yeah i dont have any opinion on json vs yaml myself, when I had to pick one I just went with json
[00:21:55] <_dave> grym: the real solution is to nuke norway.
[00:21:57] <Bayes> norway? xD
[00:21:58] <grym> json's problem is that while it's human readable, it's not comfortably human writable
[00:22:03] <grym> Bayes: NO is False! 
[00:22:06] <rpav> they really need an ordered-json spec, and you'd want some whitespace to make that optimal, but _really_, maybe don't store json in git or something (generate it from things)
[00:22:06] <grym> also, it's a country code
[00:22:12] <minall> mathsboy Not much, the block still is on. _dave you mean 'for know' as this is gonna change soon?, perhaps with Emacs 28?

[00:22:48] <grym> rpav: i doof the trailing comma in json about 80% of the time 
[00:22:50] <rpav> e.g. python or node.js or just about any modern scripting language ought to let you write near-json and spit it out in a handful of lines
[00:22:58] <_dave> grym: as a country code, it should be determined by the consumer. as a boolean... yeah who tf thought the yes/no pair would serve as a good boolean pair we already know true/false good grief man at least learn you audience, ye who writteneth yaml.

[00:50:45] <rpav> it has numbers it'll happily cast around for you, and more or less the extent of its "strength" is refusing to directly cast an aggregate to a number

[03:14:59] <parsnip> ,borg
[03:15:00] <fsbot> borg is [0] a bare-bones package manager for Emacs that assimilates packages as git submodules. See https://github.com/emacscollective/borg

[03:16:11] <parsnip> especially not "literally"
[03:16:28] <parsnip> melpa grabs what it wants, builds it, and gives it to you when you request a package
[03:16:40] <parsnip> melpa is usually building from master/main, yes
[03:16:49] <parsnip> melpa-stable builds from last tagged commit
[03:16:54] <johnjay> by 'build' you mean byte-compiling into .elc?
[03:16:59] <parsnip> ,idk
[03:17:00] <fsbot> i, i don't know that. AAAAAAA
[03:18:22] <johnjay> well for example if I go to ~/.emacs.d/elpa I can try a folder, say solaire-mode (thanks wasamasa)
[03:18:32] <johnjay> then if i go into it it has 3 el files and 1 elc file
[03:19:00] <johnjay> but idk if it created the .elc when downloading from melpa or if melpa just gives you the .el straight from github
[03:19:46] <parsnip> when you install from melpa, it is not querying github at the time of your install
[03:20:06] <johnjay> i see
[03:20:09] <parsnip> that is all i meant to clarify. those other details you'd like seem tangential.
[03:20:28] <parsnip> iiuc
[03:20:32] <parsnip> ^TM
[03:21:29] <parsnip> i think melpa queries github like once an hour for changes, not sure
[03:21:39] <johnjay> ok
[03:21:48] <johnjay> but i guess you'd prefer something more like once a week or something?
[03:22:10] <parsnip> no, my goal above was, my config should work the same a month later
[03:22:30] <parsnip> with melpa, your config can change from hour to hour, or week to week, or month to month
[03:22:41] <johnjay> ok. it's hard to wrap my brain around this concept
[03:22:45] <johnjay> but i get the appeal

[03:39:03] <ProofTechnique> I manage all my package config with use-package still, but my entire load-path is all Nix so it's mostly just for the deferred loading. I've been thinking of just writing a couple of macros and dropping use-package, but it makes it easier to share config with people
[03:40:01] <parsnip> so you use use-package to modify the load-path?
[03:40:06] <ProofTechnique> (I stole a lot of my initial nix config from jwiegley :D)

[06:27:13] <johnjay> i didn't realize i was taking such a step into the matrix as it were

[06:27:51] <johnjay> i know udp is an alternative to tcp
[06:27:52] <parsnip> local irc in tmux is nice too, so you can close all your windows

[06:28:44] <johnjay> tmux is quite nice. i don't know how i ever lived without it
[06:29:23] <parsnip> i guess even if you put computer to sleep, that tmux'ed erc session is a little easy to jump back into

[06:37:05] <johnjay> ok so if i understand znc is basically an irc login that's always on

[06:37:33] <parsnip> ;)
[06:37:39] <grym> znc is like, irc for irc

[06:38:29] <grym> johnjay: i pay for a VPS, yeah 
[06:38:33] <parsnip> there's other tricky irc connections that have come up here

[08:57:40] <codingquark> If they can run, why can't we?
[08:58:04] <twb> codingquark: basically android 12 is rolling out remote attestation as standard
[08:58:22] <parsnip> so like stock android everywhere?
[08:58:31] <twb> codingquark: unless the OS firmware is signed by the OEM vendor, all proprietary apps will go "insecure OS, I refuse to start"
[08:58:46] <parsnip> oh
[08:58:51] <JordiGH> twb I'm still on oldstable
[08:58:54] <twb> by "OS firmware" I mean the android OS installed on the handset, e.g. lineage

[08:59:10] <JordiGH> I'm a bad debianista
[08:59:28] <JordiGH> Haven't even read the release notes yet.
[08:59:34] <twb> lineage's open-source apps are already forked from Android 8 which is when all the android apps like "clock" and "torch" became proprietary closed-source 
[08:59:51] <codingquark> twb: and to have OEM signature recognised, what will OEMs have to do?
[08:59:57] <twb> Everything since then Google has added, is not in lineage
[09:00:10] <twb> codingquark: the OEM manufactures the physical device
[09:00:24] <twb> codingquark: they put their public key on it, and they use their private key to sign their firmware
[09:00:28] <codingquark> twb: oh! First party _that_ way!
[09:00:45] <codingquark> Well fuck
[09:00:46] <twb> codingquark: there is no way lineage is going to get their stuff signed except on a specialist device like a purism phone
[09:01:31] <twb> Initially, in android 12, you can expect it to only affect apps like netflix.  By android 13 or 14 it will probably apply to every app by automatically
[09:02:22] <codingquark> I already cannot run .in banking apps because they think I don't know what I am doing and should not have rooted the phone, installed lineage, removed root.
[09:02:40] <twb> codingquark: that sounds like similar/same thing
[09:02:47] <codingquark> They say "this is not your OS! This is something else! Install google play services or I won't run"
[09:03:05] <codingquark> twb: the banking apps want that google security thing
[09:03:07] <twb> Ah no THAT is it wanting gapps stack and a google account

[14:50:14] <kilobug> well, timers are pretty straight-forward, enter a duration, and it beeps once it's over, I've trouble figuring out what could go wrong; too clumsy to setup ? beep not loud enough ?
[14:50:56] <parsnip> well, you still haven't give a specific watch, so i'll start with the watch i wear most often
[14:51:00] <parsnip> dw5600
[14:53:07] <parsnip> 1: no vibrate option, 2: upper left button too recessed, hard to get to edit mode, 3: no decrement, only increment, so if you want to go from 20 minutes to 5 minutes, you have to go the long way
[14:53:33] <parsnip> the pattern seems to be, if there's only four buttons, there won't be a decrement button for timer
[14:53:37] *** Joins: foo357 (~foo357@proxy11.saabgroup.com)
[14:54:06] <parsnip> the gd-350 has five buttons, and has decrement. but not all five button watches have decrement, according to some manuals i've looked up
[14:54:22] <parsnip> the gd-350 has vibrate, and no button is too hard to press
[14:54:32] <parsnip> but it's too damn big to actually wear
[14:55:11] <parsnip> timex has a vibrating timer watch, but iirc, all the buttons still beep. and it's ugly

[14:55:31] <kilobug> hum ok, well 1. probably exists in most watches yeah but it never has been an issue for me; 2./3. don't apply to my GW-9400, but you would probably consider it too damn big to wear (or too expensive) ;)
[14:55:51] <parsnip> the apple watch appears to have very fast access to various times, so better than the gd-350 for switching times

[14:56:36] <foo357> Hello, I have started to use electric-pair-mode, it's nice but I have run into one issue: I often work with large files (thousands of lines) and auto-closing of quote ( " ) does not work, only a single "-character is inserted.

[16:17:02] <talismanick> Bayes: historically, ELisp was dynamically scoped, which breaks functional programming (you can't make proper closures, meaning returning a function from inside another, holding onto persistent state from there)
[16:17:09] <Bayes> so I have magit open, and I want to "move one file from a project subfolder to the sandbox folder"? how would you go about that with emacs? I typically open a new terminal, jump to the dir, and move it by hand but I'm sure there's a better workflow
[16:17:22] <talismanick> (dynamic scoping means variable bindings are inherited from where the function was called, not where it was defined)

[17:23:17] <rpav> Bayes: you could bind it to a more convenient (single) key, or use a prefix arg

[17:24:09] <Bayes> I'll set it up that way
[17:24:18] <rpav> the character not being able to remember doesn't make viewer more likely to forget ;)

[17:25:21] <rpav> Bayes: that's the wonderful thing about emacs .. you can make it behave however. i don't even remember how to use vanilla half the time myself these days
[17:25:48] <rnkn> I'm not saying it makes the viewer forget, I'm saying it sets up the story as being unmemorable within the terms of the story's own world
[17:25:55] <rnkn> but it's such a frustratingly common device
[17:25:57] <rpav> rnkn: that really makes no sense

[17:26:44] <rpav> bpalmer: yeah something like that .. is multiple cursors a thing in emacs then? i'll check it out
[17:26:51] <humasect> if the device is part of the story itself or chars themselves, it should be ok rnkn?
[17:26:59] <rnkn> I'm watching this scandinavian series THE HEAD
[17:27:11] <rnkn> yeah it's "okay" but I just wish we could raise the bar a little

[17:27:26] <rpav> one big reason for "the character doesn't remember" is it makes introducing things to the viewer much easier relative to the character's innate knowledge

[17:27:36] <fsbot> [1] available at marmalade, MELPA and https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el
[17:27:36] <fsbot> [2] demonstrated in this short video: emacsrocks.com/e13.html
[17:27:36] <fsbot> [3] pretty awesome
[17:27:37] <rpav> bpalmer: well sure
[17:27:41] <humasect> or look at 'Mr. Nobody' (jared leto) and it goes backwards. he is the last Mortal 
[17:28:05] <humasect> rpav: yep
[17:28:35] <rpav> e.g. the eariest "amnesia" story i can think of (anyone have earlier?) is Nine Princes in Amber (1970), and it made introducing the world pretty effective
[17:28:37] <rnkn> I mean the more generic device of: one character has witnessed something, and the main character/s need them to retell the events
[17:28:50] <rnkn> e.g. a lot of "I know it's hard, but please try to remember..." lines
[17:29:42] <rpav> oh, well, it's probably less about the device and more about the specific instance being poor then
[17:30:10] <rnkn> and the storytelling frequently gets paused when this traumatised character freaks out and stops retelling the story

[23:53:58] <kenran> I did emacs in a terminal for a while, but it wasn't working the way I liked it to in tmux
[23:54:22] <rpav> why emacs in a terminal if you have gui
[23:54:41] <GNUHacker> why gui if we have emacs terminal?
[23:55:03] <kenran> rpav: it was on macOS and my Emacs was dead slow. In a fast terminal emulator I actually gained some performance from fullscreen GUI.
[23:55:14] <rpav> because the terminal is extremely limited and can't distinguish a lot of individual keystrokes, has limited font/rendering/color support, and a host of other issues

[23:57:06] <kenran> tmux
[23:57:18] <rpav> well i tmux, but i'm still not sure why i'd emacs in it
[23:57:19] <parsnip> vim+tmux seems like a common idiom that's hard to break the muscle memory

[23:57:30] <rpav> like, i can switch to other buffers or run a shell or whatever either in emacs or another window

[23:59:43] <_dave> kind of wish dired didn't make a new buffer every traversal. that or i suck at buffer management.
[23:59:52] <parsnip> GNUHacker: it can be convenient even for an emacs'r, for making a quick edit while navigating and working in a terminal
