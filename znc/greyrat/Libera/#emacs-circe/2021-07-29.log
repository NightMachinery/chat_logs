[10:06:11] <shrini> hello all
[10:06:24] <shrini> how to enable logging all the irc chats with circe?
[10:06:57] <shrini> https://github.com/emacs-circe/circe/wiki/Configuration
[10:07:01] <irek> hi shrini 
[10:07:05] <shrini> I see here 
[10:07:06] <shrini> Change the directory where logs will be written to by customizing lui-logging-directory.
[10:07:10] <shrini> how to do this?
[10:07:14] <shrini> hello irek 
[10:07:30] <irek> shrini: this is what you need
[10:07:31] <irek> (setq lui-logging-directory "~/.config/emacs/irc-logs")
[10:07:31] <irek> (load "lui-logging" nil t)
[10:07:31] <irek> (enable-lui-logging-globally)
[10:07:58] <irek> just change path to whatever you like
[10:09:40] <shrini> irek: will do so
[10:13:21] <shrini> great irek 
[10:13:25] <shrini> it works well
[10:13:40] <shrini> please update the same on the above link
[10:13:46] <shrini> the wiki for circe at github
[10:14:01] <shrini> i was wondering where the logs files are
[10:14:12] <shrini> another question
[10:14:25] <shrini> how to autoconnect to libera and autojoin few channels?
[10:19:22] <shrini> logging works fine
[10:25:09] <irek> shrini: happy to help
[10:26:12] <irek> In my opinion wiki is already great.  It just require some basic elisp knowledge.  I was able to set up everything I wanted using just the wiki
[10:27:15] <irek> I would suggest to read README and Wiki again from top to bottom and you will find all the answers.  If not then I will gladly help you again
[10:30:07] <shrini> irek: thanks
[10:30:10] <shrini> will read again
[10:30:23] <shrini> I am very newbie to elisp
[10:30:53] <shrini> thanks again
