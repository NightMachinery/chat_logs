[02:57:02] <CalimeroTeknik> I have to say I'm probably not that much into security at all
[02:57:48] <Joanna> Don’t you care about insecure operating systems?
[02:58:07] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm a carefree programmer who still takes care to formally prove programs for correctness
[02:58:19] <Joanna> There is security and then there is security theatre
[02:58:46] <CalimeroTeknik> but I care little about active security
[02:58:50] <Joanna> Often it’s bad code that makes things insecure
[02:59:10] <Joanna> Define active..
[03:01:13] <CalimeroTeknik> looking at how things fail rather than concentrating on making them work
[03:02:10] <Joanna> Proactive rather than reactive
[03:02:45] *** Quits: flx- (~felix@user/felix) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:02:50] <Joanna> I agree with the sentiment that focus is in wrong place
[03:03:16] *** Joins: flx (~felix@user/felix)
[03:03:28] <CalimeroTeknik> you could say that I only look at security requirements, and never at security flaws
[03:03:41] <CalimeroTeknik> these are irrelevant if the requirements are met
[03:06:33] <Joanna> Sometimes you don’t realize flaws until later it’s hard to think of every possible error before starting although I do try to.
[03:08:41] <CalimeroTeknik> that's not how I proceed, I get the computer to tell me what possible error I forgot to handle
[03:08:59] <CalimeroTeknik> did you really think I could think of everything?
[03:09:31] <CalimeroTeknik> the computer is better at systematic exhaustiveness than I am
[03:10:49] <CalimeroTeknik> just find a way to write the program such that it won't even compile if there's so much as a chance you forgot anything
[03:10:57] <CalimeroTeknik> "just"
[03:12:44] <Joanna> What types of programs do you write and in what language?
[03:13:07] <CalimeroTeknik> what do you call a "type" of program?
[03:13:50] <CalimeroTeknik> is it by architectural paradigm? some measure of complexity? category of usage?
[03:13:55] <Joanna> What do they do?
[03:14:29] <CalimeroTeknik> actually, most do nothing, aka no (side) effects, but evaluate to interesting values
[03:14:48] <Joanna> So number crunchers?
[03:15:42] <CalimeroTeknik> not really, we have a ticketing system with a bunch of responsiblity chains to go through, construction planning (that one's NP)
[03:16:33] <CalimeroTeknik> funnily enough, the most challenging parts can be how to display the data on screen
[03:18:09] <Joanna> I specialize in gui
[03:18:55] <Joanna> Displaying things well definitely takes a lot of work.
[03:18:55] <CalimeroTeknik> then you'll like this one: binpacking problems with all blocks positioned in one direction is linear
[03:19:14] <CalimeroTeknik> worst case it's n×log(n)
[03:20:37] <Joanna> Do you have a screenshot?
[03:21:30] <CalimeroTeknik> basically it's displaying a week's schedule with many overlapping events
[03:22:12] <CalimeroTeknik> screenshot screenshot, hm
[03:24:20] <Joanna> Overlapping sounds interesting
[03:24:33] <catbeard> that's what she said
[03:24:44] <Joanna> Do you use an sqlite table?
[03:25:06] <catbeard> what are you doing with sqlite
[03:25:25] <CalimeroTeknik> this is algorithms, the underlying storage isn't even relevant
[03:25:47] <CalimeroTeknik> it could be anything, the data arrives as a list from the webserver
[03:25:49] <catbeard> usually a real DBMS is preferred, because the performance at scale is relevant
[03:26:02] <CalimeroTeknik> it's stuff to put on screen, you know?
[03:26:03] <catbeard> e.g. row-level locking with InnoDB / Percona
[03:26:07] <catbeard> acid compliance
[03:26:18] <catbeard> foreign key / pivot atomicity
[03:27:03] <Joanna> Hmm
[03:27:09] <catbeard> if not just slap it in redis with it's own prefix and set the eviction algorithm to all-keys-lru
[03:27:16] <catbeard> and run that shiz from memory
[03:28:55] <CalimeroTeknik> that's all nice I suppose, but my point here was about the algo to place the week's events on screen once they are somehow received by the front-end part of the implementation
[03:29:46] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: pm
[03:29:56] <CalimeroTeknik> and there is an exact deterministic heuristic for that binpacking problem when quite obviously one direction is already fully determined (you can't move events in time, they are decided)

[03:40:29] <Joanna> Sorry about that ..he has been bothering me in pms with unsolicited advice but that’s the last straw..
[03:40:37] *** Joanna sets mode: -o Joanna
[03:41:47] <CalimeroTeknik> for the sqlite question: in this instance, it's not used in the front-end, which just receives the data as a list and works from there to display it on screen
[03:42:54] <CalimeroTeknik> the back-end, produces the list of calendar events using a query to a postgresql database, the choice of postgresql being motivated by the availability of exclude constraints between table rows, so we can disallow impossible things in the calendar
[03:43:25] <Joanna> I’ve heard those mongo db databases are faster but more likely to lose data
[03:43:58] <CalimeroTeknik> mongo is not SQL actually
[03:44:06] <Joanna> Nope
[03:44:29] <Joanna> I’ll stick with sql ..
[03:45:03] <Joanna> Need to go do some things. Nice talking to you see you later
[03:48:44] <CalimeroTeknik> the most prominent issue with noSQL databases, is that you can never get a solid confirmation that your data is finished saving, it will get there "eventually"
[03:50:56] <Joanna> Yea not secure :)

[17:47:56] <elkclone> Morning Joanna et al. 
[17:48:20] <Joanna> Hi elkclone anything new ?
[17:48:55] *** Joins: xst (~xst@user/xst)

[17:53:49] *** Joins: inky_ (~inky@5.77.208.131)
[17:54:18] <elkclone> ikr hehe
[17:55:20] <Joanna> I don’t much care for the big temperature variation between day and night either..
[17:55:33] <Joanna> But I guess I’m used to it
[17:57:30] <elkclone> Happy Halloween! btw. and yeah our planet is changing rapidly. remote network monitoring stations are tracking high activity from 'isis' re near future threats. the biden plan is stalled. It seams the tough times are not over yet. lol. 
[17:58:59] * elkclone is a quietly concerned Canadian. :D
[17:59:56] <elkclone> *seems
[18:00:10] * elkclone sips more coffee.
[18:00:33] <Joanna> Biden was thwarted?
[18:01:10] <elkclone> ah I think they are still kinda fighting it out. sigh. 
[18:01:19] <elkclone> thing was supposed to be a lock. 
[18:01:42] <Joanna> Last I heard quite a few nurses firemen police and transportation workers were doing walk outs
[18:01:45] <elkclone> but as usual.. some ahole decided it was time to embarass the Potus. 
[18:02:15] <elkclone> oh yeah there is that whole other story. the virus and anti vax stuff forgot about the virus. lol
[18:02:33] <elkclone> welcome to the 'Epoch' of our time. 
[18:04:13] <Joanna> So many strange things happening there it reminds me a lot of when they split Yugoslavia into several countries.
[18:04:36] <elkclone> ah you mean the 'hot pocket' 
[18:04:44] <elkclone> ie the war?
[18:04:47] <Joanna> Hot pocket ?
[18:04:52] <elkclone> serbia
[18:05:38] <Joanna> Yea the whole splitting up of the country I read about it in a book called to kill a nation I think it was called
[18:05:55] <elkclone> https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/battle-of-medak-pocket
[18:06:47] <elkclone> that's a little heavy for morning reading sorry. lol. 
[18:07:36] <elkclone> 91-95 was my 'heydays' lol
[18:09:59] <Joanna> I didn’t even know canadians were sent to fight there my impression was that it was bombed to smitherines by nato primarily the us and Germany
[18:12:05] <elkclone> exactly why Canadian military is so effective in our darkest of times. No one absolutely no one expects us to be good at black ops, which ironically makes us very economic and effective. lol
[18:12:19] <Joanna> According to the story I read it started with destabilizing the country financially with sanctions and wrecking the jobs and pensions. The. There was the hiring thugs to terrorize the population and splitting people up by religion etc.
[18:12:59] <Joanna> Did Canadians get dragged into the Vietnam war also?
[18:13:43] <elkclone> oh yeah the whole thing was a shit show. lol. and the guys that went in after the worst serb vrs croat fighting saw evidence of genocide and other really interesting breakfast topics. hehe. 
[18:14:09] <elkclone> ah I am not sure re vietnam but I do know we fought in korea. 
[18:14:50] <elkclone> also note the Canadian forces are deeply embedded into the fabric of the British structure. 
[18:15:27] <elkclone> if britian goes somewhere we still seem to follow and back them up . even now that we are independent nation. 
[18:16:04] <Joanna> Isn’t Canada still controlled by Britain ? And Australia too ?
[18:16:48] <elkclone> ah not really 'controlled' but there is a mutual connection and an understood alliance probably forever. 
[18:17:05] <elkclone> aka 'common wealth' 
[18:18:06] <Joanna> Too much of the world wears british clothing for my liking.
[18:18:18] <elkclone> for example if I am captured and tortured in a country that has no Canadian consulate to help the brits will make good on whats on my passport. it says I am also under protection of crown. all canadian passports have this 'small print' 
[18:18:27] <Joanna> It’s like everyone wants to be british
[18:18:31] <elkclone> haha
[18:19:24] <Joanna> Very few people refuse to dress like british and that says something
[18:19:27] <elkclone> I personally have Irish/British/Native Indian blood so I can't be critical of anyone. I am a mixed up mofo. lol
[18:20:30] <Joanna> I am a mix of different Europeans I guess
[18:20:37] <elkclone> cool
[18:22:56] <elkclone> gonna be a great sunrise today :D
[18:23:21] <Joanna> I’m the type of European who can tolerate hot weather.
[18:23:58] <Joanna> There were a lot of planes squirting white stuff in sky today to block the sun :(
[18:24:22] <Joanna> Do you have that there?
[18:24:26] <elkclone> woah wtf. lol
[18:24:45] <Joanna> It started and a sunny day without any clouds
[18:24:48] <elkclone> no I do live near a major airport though. 
[18:25:03] <Joanna> Then the planes came out squirting white stuff
