[13:44:57] <sirmacik> I really enjoy using it more and more, replacing ff in most cases
[14:14:29] <treflip> Hi! I'd like to open every new buffer in a separate window. Is there any built-in solution for that or should I use hooks?
[14:41:23] <aartaka> treflip: there should be a slot for it. Execute `describe-slot` and search for `new-window` and you'll find it.
[14:46:14] <treflip> aartaka: Thank you! Nice to know that there are built-in commands for introspection in Nyxt.

[16:41:04] <Kabouik> Nyxt is the first GUI software that made me get used to hint mode, I'm pretty happy to have found an Office suite that has a hint mode too (even though I hate working with Office documents): https://0x0.st/oKbx.png That's pretty cool.
[16:59:34] <[w]> I want to create a graphical and interactive note taking/concept mapping application, does Nyxt have any kind of appropriate UI facility for that? I'm wondering if I can use Nyxt for such a thing instead of say, IUP or McCLIM.
[17:09:55] <[w]> Or perhaps what I should be doing since Nyxt is a browser and a CL application is write the logic in CL and use client-side JS (maybe a framework) for UI/presentation, and communicate the two through Nyxt? That sounds like what would be more expected to do, but I'm not sure so asking.
[17:18:35] <treflip> [w]: Sounds like an overkill. I think it'll be easier to write the entire program in McCLIM.
[17:22:12] <[w]> Perhaps it would be, unsure. Thanks for the input though as I'm weighing my options.
[17:24:10] <aartaka> [w]: The way with HTML/JS inteface and Lisp backend ia the best way for now. We're hoping to have an all-Lisp interface (translating to HTML/JS when necessary), but the dates are uncertain. Help will be appreciated :)
[17:24:56] <aartaka> treflip: Oh, request-data is certainly not the class to configure it in! Try looking for a slot in `browser` or `buffer` :)
[17:25:57] <[w]> aartaka: Do you have any relevant github issues to point me to, or a search term I can use to find the relevant issues to this?
[17:32:18] <aartaka> [w]: the GitHub label is "ui".
[18:04:30] <treflip> aartaka: Well, this doesn't work too. I've tried setting "new-window-p" and "open-external-link-in-new-window-p" to t in "browser" and "buffer" and new buffers still open in the same window. I also discovered that "open link in new window" only creates a new buffer but doesn't open a new X window. Is this behavior expected, or is it a bug I should report somehow?
[18:26:11] <aartaka> treflip: that's a bug that we're aware of :D It should be trivial to fix, but no one is irritated enough to fix such a minor thing, ahah.

[20:28:11] <blacked> tell me how can i do that

[20:28:38] <blacked> i want to make common lisp extension
[20:28:39] <blacked> tell me
[20:28:40] <blacked> tell me
[20:29:36] <treflip> blacked: well, "Read The F-f-f...riendly Manual" I guess :)
[20:29:52] <treflip> basically "M-x manual RET" in Nyxt.
[20:30:24] <blacked> oh i dont use nyxt because of brave browser bat token money .
[20:30:35] <treflip> Lol
[20:30:36] <blacked> but nyxt is great as i like common lisp
[20:34:15] <treflip> From what I've seen so far, Nyxt is very object oriented. To extend it effectively, you should have basic understanding of CLOS.
[20:36:12] <blacked> i was influenced by this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAKJE9nUVu0
[20:40:56] <treflip> Xah has a lot of useful materials. But I recomment taking his articles with a grain of salt.
[20:41:37] <blacked> xah spits truth:(  :)

[22:02:27] <jmercouris> aartaka: then perhaps a separate cookbook does in fact make sense
[22:02:42] <jmercouris> Shall we make a document for it in the documents folder?
[22:03:18] <jmercouris> sirmacik: that’s great to hear :-)
[22:17:50] <drakonis> well
[22:17:52] <drakonis> that was something
[22:20:59] <aartaka> jmercouris: Yes, cookbook should be fun. Not sure it's us that should do it, though :)
[22:22:43] <jmercouris> aartaka: shall we not at least facilitate the repository?
[22:23:01] <jmercouris> I guess perhaps we should not, maybe it should be entirely a community thing
[22:24:43] <jmercouris> Well, seems I am back to using Gnus
[22:24:50] <jmercouris> because Kmail decided to break when I updated NixOS
[22:25:05] <jmercouris> I should just have everything in Lisp
[22:25:07] <jmercouris> so that it doesn't break
[22:25:33] <jmercouris> by the way, I was banned from lobsters
[22:25:36] <aadcg> jmercouris: come to Guix
[22:25:39] <jmercouris> apparently too much self promotion lol
[22:25:47] <jmercouris> aadcg: I am on NixOS right now
[22:25:52] <jmercouris> and still it broke :-|
[22:25:59] <aadcg> jmercouris: what motivated the choice?
[22:26:05] <jmercouris> Pierre basically
[22:26:10] <aadcg> since I think you like parenthesis :)
[22:26:19] <jmercouris> he said that I should try using such a system that is reliable
[22:26:28] <aadcg> and Pierre didn't brainwash into Guix?
[22:26:34] <jmercouris> and I didn't want to use Guix because of the GPL twist
[22:26:39] <jmercouris> and the focus on only free software
[22:26:45] <jmercouris> No, he did not
[22:26:57] <aadcg> "brainwash" :)
[22:27:16] <aadcg> what do you mean by GPL twist?
[22:27:21] <jmercouris> I'm not exactly a fan of the FSF
[22:27:31] <aadcg> I have noticed
[22:27:39] <jmercouris> I mean that it is only favoring certain licenses and to get non-free software you have to find a hidden repository etc
[22:27:46] <aadcg> I think I have moving into that direction too
[22:27:55] <jmercouris> it seems to be driven by religious beliefs rather than pragmatism
[22:28:21] <aadcg> you might be right, but Guix is quite non-FSFy
[22:28:36] <jmercouris> perhaps one day I will give it a shot
[22:28:41] <jmercouris> in any case, I actually wish to create my own OS
[22:29:02] <aadcg> yes, I see where you're going
[22:29:10] <aadcg> that's the whole point
[22:29:13] <jmercouris> indeed
[22:29:32] <aadcg> have you played with mezzano?
[22:29:40] <jmercouris> I have, in a VM
[22:29:45] <jmercouris> I've not installed it bare metal anywhere
[22:29:51] <jmercouris> I was very impressed with how far it has come
[22:30:24] <aadcg> and what's the point for you?
[22:30:35] <aadcg> a system that you find sane, or you want the world to convert?
[22:30:42] <jmercouris> I want the world to see the light
[22:30:51] <jmercouris> I believe that with access to better tools, we can do better work
[22:31:03] <aadcg> but that's where the bottleneck is... POSIX, endless protocols, it's a nightmare...
[22:31:06] <jmercouris> I think that the existing operating systems and paradigms are very bad
[22:31:25] <aadcg> yes, I've read the UNIX Haters Book following your advice btw
[22:31:30] <jmercouris> I didn't say anything about POSIX compliance, won't even consider it!
[22:31:38] <jmercouris> and what did you think of this book?
[22:31:44] <aadcg> very enlightening
[22:32:02] <aadcg> as well a document called LispOS by Robert Strandth
[22:32:29] <jmercouris> yes, that one as well
[22:32:44] <aadcg> but then, if we don't care about POSIX, isn't it some kind of "ideal" parallel universe?
[22:32:57] <aadcg> that, btw, would also fail to be pragmatic
[22:33:06] <jmercouris> yes, it would be
[22:33:15] <jmercouris> there will have to be some interop with other machines
[22:33:28] <jmercouris> but we don't need to force compliance, we'll reimagine the world
[22:33:34] <aadcg> I see
[22:33:46] <aadcg> btw, what do you think about scheme?
[22:33:58] <jmercouris> I think it is an interesting concept
[22:34:19] <jmercouris> It is a good language, but it could use more batteries
[22:34:23] <aadcg> but not pragmatic enough?
[22:34:27] <jmercouris> that's correct
[22:34:29] <aadcg> I see
[22:34:31] <jmercouris> it feels more of an academic exercise
[22:34:46] <aadcg> I don't want to take your time
[22:35:00] <jmercouris> no problem
[22:35:07] <aadcg> I read at some point that you were going through a difficult moment (not sure what happened)
[22:35:14] <aadcg> I hope you're doing fine
[22:35:23] <jmercouris> thank you, I hope you are doing well as well
[22:35:30] <jmercouris> I have worried about you some times
[22:36:02] <aadcg> I do mean it... I have regretted lots of things actually
[22:36:12] <aadcg> I'm sorry for being a pain in the ass
[22:36:19] <aadcg> really? interesting
[22:36:27] <jmercouris> you don't need to apologize for that, I understand it was coming from pain
[22:36:42] <aadcg> I was/am mentally sick
[22:36:51] <aadcg> but I'm working on it
[22:37:02] <jmercouris> That's good to hear, working on it is step 1
[22:37:22] <aadcg> some crazy things happenned too... but that's life I guess :)
[22:37:22] <jmercouris> and with time, you will figure it all out
[22:37:28] <jmercouris> indeed, such is life
[22:38:36] <aadcg> well, again, honestly I wish all the best for you
[22:39:01] <jmercouris> you as well, and feel free to drop in whenever you want, this channel is free from FSF style censorship ;-)
