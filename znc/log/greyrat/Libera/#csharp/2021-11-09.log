[00:12:25] <user1> hi
[00:13:47] <_genuser_> so I'm registering a Mediator with the .NET DI using services.AddMediatR(typeof(Startup));
[00:13:59] <_genuser_> but the injected IMediator into controllers is always null.

[00:17:12] <_genuser_> I'm a mediator n00b in setting it up from scratch. So this project already has a registration and a controller that should be getting injected with a mediator. I'm trying debug it.

[00:23:11] <_genuser_> ki9a so I'm using .net 5.0 as target framework for the project. If I just re-install the mediatR NuGet package, I'm assuming that would automatically pull the correct version (as long as package says it supports .net5.0)
[00:23:21] <_genuser_> is that what you meant by version mismatch?

[00:32:04] <redoc> the text won't update...
[00:32:59] <_genuser_> are you update the button text during or right before starting some work (like a loop or something)?

[00:38:19] <redoc> I have the bindingcontext set as the Bind initially works
[00:39:30] <redoc> the codebehind is getting hit, value is getting changed, UI just isn't getting updated. tried OnPropertyChanged(), OnPropertyChanged("ListText"), SetProperty(ref listTtext, value)

[00:54:22] <_genuser_> teegee2 mornin
[00:55:13] <_genuser_> ki9a: The parent has a IMediator inject into constructor. And that's null. So I injected it into the child also. Which hides the inherited instance.

[01:03:21] <teegee2> interesting
[01:03:22] <MizMahem> so, I've been wondering. If you do AOT, do you get a native binary out the other end, or are you still targeting the .NET JIT or whatever?

[01:05:22] *** zaher_ is now known as zaher
[01:05:59] <JakeSays> MizMahem: you get a native binary. the point of aot is to avoid jit
[01:06:02] <_genuser_> ki9a, in which case I'm not sure what's going on. I just added a separate property to the child and injected the Mediator. So not sure what's going on. The parent was already wired up to be injected with a mediator. And it wasn't working.
[01:06:17] <MizMahem> that's what I thought, just wanted to confirm.

[02:35:19] <Nasp> Ofc that wasn't worth it
[02:35:22] <merced> and lol DevJohnC yeah..
[02:35:28] <Nasp> Marvel movies in general aren't
[02:35:43] <DevJohnC> eh, I enjoy most of the Marvel movies quite a bit
[02:35:43] <merced> idk i'm super excited to see dr strange 2 if it ever comes out
[02:35:44] <teegee> :O
[02:36:12] <DevJohnC> I haven't seen Shan Chi or w/e it is yet, nor The Eternals which is apparently bad but i dunno
[02:36:18] <DevJohnC> trying to avoid spoilers and stuff is tricksy
[02:36:20] <merced> same
[02:36:27] <merced> shang chi was supposed to be good
[02:36:36] <merced> i'm excited for eternals even though the haters gotta hate :v
[02:36:38] <teegee> Shang Chi was the one I watched. I liked it
[02:36:43] <DevJohnC> yeah I've heard good things but not much more than a pretty positive vibe
[02:36:46] <teegee> but then, I like most Marvels
[02:36:51] <merced> did you guys like What If?
[02:37:00] <DevJohnC> yes and no
[02:37:01] <merced> most of the people i've talked to is take it-or-leave-it
[02:37:01] <Nasp> Never understood the hype about marvel movies
[02:37:15] <Nasp> Like that entire avengers things was poorly written
[02:37:22] <merced> lol
[02:37:28] <teegee> I've only seen the first 3 whatifs. apparently it gets better
[02:37:38] <merced> i enjoyed the shit out of the what ifs
[02:37:45] <merced> even though a few of them were very... meh
[02:37:47] <Nasp> What ifs?
[02:37:49] <DevJohnC> there are a couple of What If episodes that stand out that were great
[02:37:50] <irwiss> it's comics for teenagers, don't expect hugo quality writing, cmon
[02:37:55] <DevJohnC> most of them I'm luke warm on
[02:38:01] <Nasp> irwiss:  Yeah it seems like it's mostly for kids
[02:38:21] <merced> i was super off-put by the animation in the first episode, but i got over it after a few sodes
[02:38:47] <merced> wandavision was fucking awesome though
[02:39:14] <DevJohnC> I loved most of WandaVision, it had some great little touches and details, told a pretty solid story about dealing with grief
[02:39:17] <teegee> that also took some effort to get over the first 3
[02:39:30] <merced> oh loki!
[02:39:36] <merced> also enjoyed the shit out of the loki series
[02:39:40] <teegee> <3
[02:39:47] <DevJohnC> Loki is pretty solid if you can overlook the forced early character development
[02:39:54] <merced> meh lol
[02:39:56] <merced> yeah
[02:40:29] <DevJohnC> like, this is the Loki we just saw bantering like an evil asshole with Black Widow about how he'll make Hawkeye kill her in some fucked up sadistic, intimate way
[02:40:39] <Nasp> Got my electric bill it,s doubled :(

[02:40:56] <DevJohnC> lol
[02:41:17] <Nasp> Electricity prices have doubled
[02:41:24] <Nasp> Maybe trying to go windmill only wasn't a good idea, who knew
[02:41:40] <merced> get some geothermal generators yo
[02:41:43] <DevJohnC> Winter Soldier and Falcon was meh - it felt like it wanted to be about systemic racism but didn't offer any solutions or real perspective beyond some hamfisted scenes
[02:41:50] <merced> DevJohnC: 100% agreed
[02:41:55] <merced> was still pretty fun to watch drunk regardless lol
[02:42:02] <DevJohnC> lol
[02:42:22] <teegee> ah yeah, winter soldier. There's one I watched 2 episodes and then forgot about it
[02:42:28] <irwiss> meh even history channel is fun to watch when drunk :P
[02:42:34] <teegee> I think.. can't remember
[02:42:36] <merced> irwiss: true that
[02:42:40] <Nasp> Solar cells and geothermal for a home would be superb i think
[02:42:46] <Nasp> Just being able to go off grid
[02:42:47] <merced> history vault on amazon is totally worth the $9 a month
[02:42:50] <Nasp> Maybe a battery as well
[02:43:00] <teegee> home geothermal. That's something
[02:43:21] <merced> i just run a farm of hamsters on running wheels
[02:43:22] <JakeSays> electricity from farts is the way to go
[02:43:25] <Nasp> Yeah and then combine with solar, then you have heating + power
[02:43:27] <merced> they generate like 10Kwh per day
[02:43:54] <teegee> store power in H2
[02:44:07] <JakeSays> merced: lol i wonder how many hamsters it'd take to generate 10kwh
[02:44:09] <Nasp> Only annoying thing is batteries are a bit expensive
[02:44:38] <merced> JakeSays: according to wikipedia A hamster in a running wheel equipped with a generator can generate up to 500 mW electric power, enough for illuminating small LED lamps.[citation needed]
[02:44:42] <merced> lmfao
[02:44:55] <JakeSays> LOL
[02:44:58] <Slade> ah, flying with the unwashed masses, with a plebian support staff.. reminds me my natural feelings of the species regarding self governance
[02:45:17] <teegee> 20k hamsters. that's a lot of poop
[02:45:25] <Nasp> That's a lot of extra hamsters
[02:45:32] <Nasp> Don't they breed like all critters
[02:45:40] <merced> oh yeah! and all the fart/methane can be burned for more electricity!
[02:45:45] <merced> :thinking:
[02:45:50] <JakeSays> lol
[02:46:06] <Nasp> Hamster powered geo thermal
[02:46:19] <merced> and when they expire, their bodies can be used for biofuel <_x
[02:46:27] <teegee> you might want to consider a separate breeding farm
[02:46:30] <JakeSays> merced: you'd probably need 40k because they won't be running all the time
[02:46:42] <Nasp> I think all newly built homes requires geothermal or solar
[02:46:44] <merced> JakeSays: 8 hour shifts, so like 60k
[02:46:52] <JakeSays> LOL
[02:46:52] <Nasp> Atleast some source of alternative energy source
[02:47:04] <JakeSays> man the animal huggers will be all over you
[02:47:14] <Slade> <JakeSays> merced: lol i wonder how many hamsters it'd take to generate 10kwh  <-- 3d print some hamsters using Nitinol and some biomass->chemical energy system
[02:47:31] <Nasp> How much food does 60k hamsters eat
[02:47:34] <JakeSays> nitinol?
[02:47:39] <Nasp> Sounds like you aren't saving so much
[02:47:59] <JakeSays> Nasp: just feed them the dead hamsters
[02:48:01] <merced> Nasp: depends if i'm mining bitcoin with the hamsters
[02:48:05] <merced> also JakeSays  ^
[02:48:07] <teegee> skybrator sounds like a good option there
[02:48:11] <irwiss> Nasp: recoup some of the cost shoveling all the shit they produce to a farmstead
[02:48:13] <Nasp> Are hamsters canibals
[02:48:25] <Nasp> Then ship the shit to JakeSays
[02:48:32] <JakeSays> i believe they are

[02:49:13] <Nasp> https://www.shitexpress.com/ https://poopsenders.com/ i wonder of these ubsiness are real
[02:49:14] <JakeSays> we should fire off this proposal to the climate change conference!
[02:49:32] <merced> JakeSays: lets split the profits 50/50
[02:49:43] <merced> you provide the hamsters ill write the whitepaper
[02:49:50] <teegee> JakeSays: only if you can put them on a seaweed based diet
[02:49:55] <Nasp> "But the hamsters that ate corn ate most of their pups. In another experiment, the researchers gave one set of hamsters corn with B3 added, and another set corn without B3. The hamsters that got the B3 behaved normally. The hamsters that did not get B3 consumed their young."
[02:49:56] <JakeSays> lead article in the post: "C# developers solve world carbon problem"
[02:50:01] <Nasp> Be sure to get your B3 vitamins
[02:50:10] <merced> JakeSays: lmfao
[02:50:33] <merced> hmmm so all we have to do is find a food source low in B3
[02:50:38] <merced> then the problem solves itself in a few generations
[02:50:41] <teegee> followup: "And you thought IRC was dead"
[02:50:42] <JakeSays> "in further news, Nobel peace prize given to JakeSays"
[02:50:54] <Nasp> Why would hamsters solve it
[02:51:06] <merced> self-sustaining cannibal hamster population
[02:51:13] <merced> all the nutrients get recycled
[02:51:18] <Nasp> "The world's electricity consumption amounted to approximately 23,398 billion kilowatt hours in 2018"
[02:51:23] <Nasp> That's a lot of hamsters
[02:51:38] <Nasp> Pretty sure it's not self sustaining
[02:51:45] <merced> damn
[02:52:02] <merced> we could always GMO some buff hamsters

[02:55:34] <JakeSays> brianonymous: LOL that would be nuts
[02:55:51] <Nasp> teegee:  Soon means atleast 100 years
[02:56:12] <JakeSays> we'll have fusion in my lifetime

[02:57:54] <merced> maybe i fucked the math
[02:58:00] <Nasp> Also when you say "have fusion" you mean viable producing more energy fusion?

[07:47:43] <Cecen> Is there any performance difference between calling a method that takes an Action with a static method vs. a lambda?
[07:47:53] <Cecen> Assuming nothing is captured
[07:49:16] <sysRPL> did anyone here today talk about dotnet core 6 being released and a new version of c# along with it?
[07:50:52] <MizMahem> Cecen... it depends. But surprisingly enough, the lambda can have a performance advantage.
[07:51:38] <MizMahem> The difference being that the static will need to get cast to a delegate, so no performance advantage there over a lambda.
[07:51:59] <MizMahem> But the *lambda* can be cached, while the static is not.
[07:52:06] <MizMahem> Sec and I can show you.

[07:55:19] <MizMahem> Cecen: https://sharplab.io/#gist:bbd12936a0dea5fb694d9ef0940ba1fb
[07:55:42] <MizMahem> as you can see the static method has to get cast to a delegate, which requires an allocation.
[07:56:13] <MizMahem> *but* the lambda gets cached, so only has to get created once, while the static method will get created every time.
[07:56:33] <MizMahem> if you are just calling the method once, no big deal.
[07:56:51] <MizMahem> but if you are doing it inside a tight loop or hot path, the difference could be relevant.

[20:39:36] <planetcall|work> You can copy paste the json payload. Custom Properties can be painful if you have many.
[20:40:12] <planetcall|work> But servicebusexplorer gives you a better interaction with the service bus. You can resubmit messages, see the DLQ messages, clear the subscriptions etc.

[22:12:28] <ezio> See that asshole with the peace sign on his license plate giving me the finger and pushing me out of his lane?  God made us #1 'cause he loves us the best.  Well maybe he should go bless someone else for a while and give us a rest.
[22:12:44] <khanred> what
[22:13:06] <ezio> WHAT
[22:17:14] <bomb> on the bright sight, he doesn't probably posses a gun, because he's a liberal
[22:17:43] <khanred> who
[22:17:45] <Diablo-D3> uh, what?
[22:17:55] <Diablo-D3> do you know how many fucking 'liberals' I know that own guns?
[22:17:57] <khanred> also what
[22:18:26] <Diablo-D3> I know zero far right republicans that own non-hunting firearms for their personal protection
[22:19:13] <Diablo-D3> I know several big L libertarians, several socialists, several straight up anarchists, several of every "not a republican, but not a centrist either" type of person that own firearms
[22:19:28] <bomb> chances are you know more liberals than far rights republicans overall
[22:19:44] <Diablo-D3> the largest purchasing group of firearms over the past 4 years has been a) women, and b) not-republicans
[22:20:03] <Diablo-D3> bomb: possibly, but I live in what is still considered a red state
[22:20:06] <bomb> looking beautiful America
[22:20:21] <bomb> over here only cops get to carry guns
[22:20:40] <Diablo-D3> most of the people on the left I know carry guns just because of cops
[22:20:51] <khanred> uh
[22:20:56] <bomb> what was the blue/red state again. red ones are confederation?
[22:21:01] <tlf> lol
[22:21:11] <tlf> dont say that part out loud, its heritage not hate
[22:21:12] <Diablo-D3> red is republican, but yes, the south is also an acceptable parallel
[22:21:44] <bomb> are there black/hispanic republicans in the US?
[22:22:29] <tlf> ironically
[22:22:30] <Diablo-D3> bomb: but yeah, in many cities across america, the cops switched sides and no longer work for the public interest, but to help usher in a nationwide insurrection, much like how all the post-ww1 police in germany joined the nazi party and helped purge small towns of their jewish population without skipping a beat
[22:22:42] <Diablo-D3> yes, there are
[22:22:48] <Diablo-D3> they are rare, and very confused.
[22:22:58] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: how are things on your end of NL?
[22:23:03] <bomb> shit, Gestapo
[22:23:09] <bomb> a civil war is coming?
[22:23:10] <tlf> well, the hispanic version of republicans makes sense if you look at their history
[22:23:14] <Diablo-D3> a lot of people think it is
[22:23:21] <khanred> A lot of people are also insane
[22:23:34] <Diablo-D3> khanred: not insane, but just angry and bitter.
[22:23:35] <tlf> but that "makes sense" is a grasp
[22:23:37] <bomb> you guys should move to Europe while you can
[22:23:42] <ki9a> please no
[22:23:43] <ki9a> stay
[22:23:57] <Diablo-D3> Im not moving to Europe. Frankly, its not like Europe is much better
[22:24:06] <Diablo-D3> you guys dodged a bullet with brexit though
[22:24:13] <tlf> lol
[22:24:17] <bomb> nah it's quite comfy here
[22:24:31] <Diablo-D3> now only if we could get, like, texit to happen
[22:24:40] <MichaelLong> brexit was the best that could happen to europe
[22:24:44] <khanred> They tried that once
[22:24:47] <khanred> Didn't go over well
[22:24:50] <bomb> why is Tejas an American state in the first place? make it Mehico again
[22:25:30] <tlf> the same reason 60 something countries share an independence day from europe :D

[22:28:50] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Without rehashing what's in today's chat history somewhere, employer said fuck you instead of thank you after getting them iso certified  and onboarding a new tech partner. New employer (back to Softwarepark, now Trustbit) was very welcoming and I could start earlier. Was already joining them in Vienna on thursday for a get together (2 days) so I'll start then :D
[22:28:56] <ki9a> Suchiman: jonp: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/coreclr/tools/ILVerify#how-to-use-ilverify turns out I had to pass -r: ilverify ConsoleApplication6.dll -r "\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\6.0.0\*.dll"
[22:29:23] <MaNa2k> ah shit, i probably need copper braid strips or whatever its called for desoldering old tin

[22:30:01] <ki9a> either way, nice
[22:30:45] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Yeah since they broke their promises, didn't communicate I suggested it would be best if we went our separate ways in a good way.. then I did everything in my power to do that, while they played along only to screw me in the end :)
[22:30:50] <MaNa2k> when i was soldering stuff probably 15-20 years ago, i didnt know about flux
[22:31:08] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Anyway all that stuff is behind me now, turned in my devices etc today and flying to Vienna tomorrow :D
[22:31:13] <MaNa2k> but back then the boards wasnt that microscopic like they are today
[22:31:27] <tlf> I just got my jstd a few months ago
[22:31:32] <tlf> Im happy that is not my job
[22:32:55] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: working from home ?
[22:33:36] <MatthiasVance> Yeah going remote again, so preparing for that too. At least this time around I'm not in lockdown, have more social gatherings and a car :D
[22:34:00] <ki9a> :)
[22:34:05] <ki9a> decent pay too ?
[22:34:11] <MaNa2k> anyone know wtf this is https://ibb.co/QvkSs5g i got it with my iron long ago. i use it as a stand for my iron, but not sure if thats the use case
[22:35:26] <tlf> never seen one of those on a rig before

[22:59:48] <bomb> less polished, exactly
[23:00:32] <bomb> I will give MATE a try
[23:00:54] <Diablo-D3> mate and cinnamon werent bad
[23:01:11] <Diablo-D3> mate preserves gnome 2 before it got all weird at the end and started transitioning into proto-3
[23:01:17] <Diablo-D3> cinnamon tries to unfuck 3 and turn it back into 2
[23:01:33] <Diablo-D3> they're both decent efforts but ... fuck. meh.

[23:02:50] <bomb> wtf MATE megabytes of MathJax packages installed. I'm on a slow internet...
[23:02:52] <Diablo-D3> its not like xfce that merely transitioned to gtk3 and still uses no gnome deps by default
