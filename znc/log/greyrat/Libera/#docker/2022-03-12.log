[00:00:18] <Sven_vB> like the first part of --publish '<host_ip>:<port_on_host>:<port_in_container>'?
[00:01:53] <Sven_vB> the example command a few paragraphs down uses 172.19.0.1, and my docker bridge has 172.19.0.* for the containers inside it, so I assumed it would be about them.
[00:02:43] <tabakhase> kinda like the first part - but more specifically what it is when you DONT give a first path
[00:02:48] <tabakhase> *part
[00:03:23] <Sven_vB> then my confusion prevails. why would the example use an IP from inside docker?
[00:03:36] <tabakhase> 0.0.0.0 default - some may change that to 127.0.0.1 to "be more secure by default" ((but from what i remember compose for example ignores that entirely))

[00:06:17] <tabakhase> and 172.19. is rly just a random example there - that this by chance is your docker IP is "luck" (as docker "just tries to find something thats free" when started)
[00:06:33] *** TheSilentLink_ is now known as TheSilentLink
[00:07:28] <Sven_vB> maybe the example should use an IP from 192.168.* then, so it doesn't clash no matter what 172.* docker picks

They are different images because they run different commands with slightly different configuration copied with separate copy commands. So indeed the second php image should change too

[02:42:45] <tabakhase> and did i just see a links: in there? arrrr *raises his bible*
[02:44:07] <tabakhase> (also, note the docker-compose "config" subcommand to print out a parsed config rather than having to assemble in the head and makeup your env-Vars
[02:45:04] <gebbione> ok so links is not a good practice?
[02:45:48] <gebbione> i just googled quickly, would depends_on be the better choice?
[02:46:18] <tabakhase> depends_on is just create-order - links: shall migrate to networks
[02:47:40] <gebbione> ok so in this case is rather redundant and deprecated
[02:50:18] <tabakhase> also i dont seem to be able to make any sense from the supposedly 3 php containers you have, half with volumes, half with dockerfiles, half with bindmounts...
[02:50:22] <rawtaz> gebbione: why not pastebin the Dockerfiles?
[02:51:23] <tabakhase> and if your problem boils to "build does nothing" (given the 10h old tag?) -- including what the heck build even did in that paste would help a lot ;-) maybe its throwing errors in big bold letters at you :P
[02:51:55] <rawtaz> yeah this is frankly silly
[02:52:08] <rawtaz> missing Dockerfiles, missing the env script, presumably missing output as well
[02:52:14] <rawtaz> why bother asking when not providing proper information
[02:52:29] <rawtaz> people have more interesting things to do than dragging information out of others lol :P
[02:52:38] <Tach> when I run docker image ls -a I see a lot of none repo images... how can I remove those ?
[02:52:40] <tabakhase> also images may just not be what you think it does? note that it very specifically is "List images used by the created containers" -- NOT "what the file says" -- so unless you "up" to update the containers it wont give a dam

[05:13:28] <JohnDoe1> trying to enable xdebug in an alpine php docker image. All is well, except it doesn't seem to connect to port 9003. Does that need to be forwarded somehow? php should be trying to connect to host 172.17.0.1 as per xdebug config.
[05:14:32] <JohnDoe1> forwarding is probably the wrong terminology since really the host is listening on that port, but essentially, anything needed to allow communication on that port from within the container?
[05:27:54] <tabakhase> JohnDoe1 using remote_connect_back?
[05:28:08] <tabakhase> (cause it connects to you, not you to it)

[05:38:40] <tabakhase> on further notes when hardcoding - check that this actually IS your host ((docker for mac or docker for windows are a VM)) - and if potentially your firewall closed off the docker0 interface
[05:39:40] <JohnDoe1> tabakhase yes using remote_connect_back which is discover_client_host for xdebug 3 (php 8)
[05:40:13] <JohnDoe1> I have tried both phpstorm and vscode. php -i in the container lists the right config and updates it immediately as I change the mounted xdebug.ini configuration file
[05:40:44] <JohnDoe1> I use docker natively within wsl2 (not docker for windows, but installed docker inside wsl2 so it's an internal service)
[05:41:21] <JohnDoe1> I also use ddev on this same machine and that works just fine, it's perplexing so far why alpine behaves differently. ddev uses a debian based image
[05:42:35] <tabakhase> have you ever used xdebug before? - so, do you know how to even trigger it?  (or trying unittests or whatever with debugging ON?) - just to make sure its no user-error :P dont take it personal ;-)
[05:42:44] <JohnDoe1> from debian 11 I can do a ping host.docker.internal and it pings 172.17.0.1 which is an entry in /etc/hosts --- I have duplicated that on the alpine image
[05:43:05] <JohnDoe1> not taking it personally, I've done my fair share of stupid mistakes, no worries.
[05:43:33] <tabakhase> and well then the 172. is likely wrong already (as your ide is likely in win, not on the wsl"vm")

[05:43:56] <JohnDoe1> true that, let me do a port forwarding for 9003 just in case
[05:44:28] <JohnDoe1> generally windows runs this service that keep mapping ports between wsl2 and windows so you don't normally have to do port forwarding but you can do that if you want to
[05:45:43] <tabakhase> check the ip on the interface in windows and try hardcoding that (((connect_back can have trouble if you got further things inbetween that rewrite the IP as well like the userland-proxy or a bad NAT...)))
[05:46:12] <tabakhase> windows firewall "should" be opened automatically from the ide when it launches
[05:48:15] <JohnDoe1> true that, port forwarding 9003 manually didn't change anything. Speaking of stuff between php and my ide: nginx which feeds php .10 but nginx itself sees .1 https://paste.debian.net/1233897/
[05:48:23] <JohnDoe1> hardcoding windows IP
[05:48:55] <tabakhase> and well last resort, see what it actually does, helpfull example commands in the readme here -> https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot -- just to verify that it even tries something ((might also be visible on the "time it takes" not sure tho))
[05:49:27] *** R2Racoon87 is now known as R2Racoon
[05:50:30] <tabakhase> and yep, nginx will certainly mess that up --- tho, i would expect x3 to respect "X-Forwarded-For" headers or such by now... maybe some extra switch needed to enable that - then connect_back should work fine again
[05:51:05] <JohnDoe1> bummer, windows IP doesn't do it either. Very odd.

[05:53:22] <tabakhase> and, verify your debugger actually listens openly - ive seen them configured to localhost-only before...
[05:53:51] <JohnDoe1> vscode is set to listen on 0.0.0.0 not sure about phpstorm but I'm sure I can find the option somewhere
[05:53:53] <tabakhase> (so, netstat in cmd or whatever --  maybe even try hammering it with telnet or so from wsl)
[05:54:40] <JohnDoe1> I have a feeling it's alpine/php not initiating the connection to the host on 9003
[05:55:02] <JohnDoe1> since it can curl a temp http server listening on wsl's 0.0.0.0

[05:57:48] <hydracat> tabakhase not a typo, i am brand new to docker and simply have no idea what is going on :D
[05:58:04] <hydracat> it makes sense

[06:00:39] <tabakhase> hydracat hold a miute - i just reread your opener m(  ---- you are NOT using bindmounts, you use a named volume --- so forget what i said there
[06:01:12] <tabakhase> with "volume", yes, the files that were in the container when the volume was used the very first time WILL be copied over
[06:01:59] <hydracat> I think I get it.
[06:02:02] <hydracat> thank you
[06:02:06] <tabakhase> i must have read that wrong cause you talked about a "todo-db file" as if thats some file on your disk =)

[06:02:54] <hydracat> https://docs.docker.com/get-started/05_persisting_data/
[06:02:58] <tabakhase> (this is all a little further complicated by bindmounts and volumes BOTH using the "-v" / "volumes:" keywords with rly the ONLY difference beeing "if the first character is a / or not" ;D
[06:03:31] <tabakhase> but functional, then some HUGE differences like the "one copies what the container had, the other does not"

[06:04:20] <hydracat> basically, i'm creating a volume called todo-db, and mounting it at /etc/todos/ inside of the container, and any files inside of /etc/todos/ and subdirectories will be added to that volume, and will persist even after the container is removed
[06:04:23] <hydracat> as i understand it
[06:04:41] <tabakhase> yeps
[06:05:04] <hydracat> as an aside - can that volume be mounted to more than 1 container simultaneously ?
[06:05:25] <tabakhase> yes
[06:05:47] <tabakhase> note that "existing files in a volume" often has a "bad smell" to it --- as now in turn, this also means that the files that were copied in the volume will never ever again get updated even when you update the image

[06:07:27] <hydracat> (just kidding)
[06:07:58] <tabakhase> so, if you for example wanted to drop a .htaccess file into a "uploads" directory or such -  a) half the people would loose it from using a bindmount and b) the other half will have a outdated htaccess in 6 months ;D -> so here entrypoints come into the game that may "rsync/cp some data from /usr/src in the container to /var/stuff/uploads" and such stuff :P

[06:10:00] <hydracat> very interesting stuff! Any good recomendations on where to learn more about the platform after i finish with the official https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ guide ?
[06:15:48] <tabakhase> no direct resources... but my general drift is "docker has no learning curve, its a series of steps..." - so its more about finding some biteable chunks that still give useable results while having no actual clue yet :D - so, dont dockerize your app... heck, for the first days/weeks the hub alone and no dockerfile longer than 3 lines "should" be able to do 80% of the work - so start with 
[06:15:48] <tabakhase> tooling, maybe some CI-pipeline stuff, then a testsystem(where you dont care about data, or zombie processes that  corrupt the disks), move on to promote that to devsystem, then restart from scratch and actualy "dockerize" ((by then you likely have some changes you want/need to make to your app anyhow to "play nicely" ((like, consuming env-variables for example))  --- and THEN docker isnt 
[06:15:49] <tabakhase> actually all that complicated - especially when you have a few linux basics already, its rly just 3 or 4 commands, with like 10 flags to remember and 2 kinda "file formats" - where for either its "mostly the english word of what you want" so you very very rarely will need things like cheatsgheets after you got some basics

[06:19:57] <tabakhase> how long that may take? rly hard to say... ive seen people struggle in here for months that still havent understood the image<->container cycle correctly ;D   - but also linuxusers that "do the whole story" within a day or two (cause then its more "slang" than "learning a language" given its all just reskinned cgroups/namespaces/jails whatever you wanne call it :D)
[06:22:35] <hydracat> If you'll allow me to introduce myself, my background is definitely Linux admin. I've worked in IT in several roles, but never learned devops tools. I am currently working in an unrelated field and trying to reinvent myself with a new skill set. I am planning on learning enough to land a job in devops field by end of year. I have never been a developer or coder other than a few college classes on data structures/algorithms.

[11:14:31] <ericlee> not sure if anyone even did this in alpine:latest image: I'd like to make my container has SSH daemon started when it starts, so I tried to add RUN ["/etc/init.d/sshd", "start"] in the Dockerfile but seems SSH is not started still.
[11:14:57] <ericlee> anyone has better idea to make ssh start when containers starts? thanks in advance.

[11:17:29] <ericlee> steerpike, hi, nope, I just need ssh started
[11:18:05] <ericlee> you mean I need to make sshd running as a foreground process? 
[11:18:08] <steerpike> yeah, the problem is that your container probably quits because sshd is probably set to background
[11:18:10] <steerpike> right
[11:19:48] <ericlee> hmm, I tried to use RUN ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"] in the last line of Dockerfile, but the docker build process will stuck because of this to run this command. 
[11:20:01] <ericlee> Sorry not RUN, I used CMD 
[11:22:31] <steerpike> i don't know why it would get stuck, it shouldn't be trying to execute sshd at the time build

[21:58:19] <hydracat> oh you mean the command, it said "compose is not  a docker command"
[21:58:58] <rvalue> there was some update i think the new version has docker compose in the command itself
[21:59:24] <ikke> It's a plugin
[22:00:00] <hydracat> i was using the docker repo, but debian repo supports docker now as the docker.io package, i'll maybe try theirs
