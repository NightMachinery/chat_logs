[01:27:55] <spstarr> who ever let Microsoft decide how to write non-OS stuff, like UFEFI, SecureBoot..
[01:28:02] <iphone> Palladium == janky SELinux

[01:28:20] <spstarr> UEFI even
[01:28:34] <spstarr> I use Secureboot with my own signature for signing Kernel driver in Linux
[01:28:40] <signofzeta> Intel chose FAT32 and the PE format for UEFI because it was so common... also, Wintel hegemony.

[01:30:34] <DrZak> somebody can?
[01:30:59] <DrZak> there are 20 majore and hundreads of minor linux distributions, each with their own crap
[01:31:07] <DrZak> unix is just sad and depressing
[01:31:30] <DrZak> luckily nothing else survived
[01:31:36] <spstarr> i didnt say Linux to do it either
[01:31:46] <DrZak> i know
[01:31:51] <DrZak> that's why is said - nobody can
[01:32:08] <DrZak> and since the insurance will pay off everything, nobody needs to try
[01:32:11] <spstarr> so we trust Microsoft to do it for us and fuck us all up \o/

[02:01:36] <shakygator> if youre hitting a load balancer thats when using multiple certs is an issue. if it hits a web server directly you can serve different certs for each hostname if you wanted

[02:02:13] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> well maybe not

[02:02:23] <shakygator> at least with AWS i think its only one cert per listener
[02:02:27] <shakygator> so you could on a different port
[02:02:34] <yuken> Yeah @NinjaStyle - I'm not doing anything fancy here. Basically, home server runs Airsonic, VPN through Tinc, reverse proxy with nginx to the reverse proxy on home server.
[02:02:38] <shakygator> maybe if you passed through SSL to the target group

[02:40:42] <iphone> how can a pentest cause that much emotional damage to C-levels?
[02:41:15] <DrGibby> it was the second worst engagement in terms of complete compromise I have even been a part of 
[02:42:08] <DrGibby> it also didn't help that their IT folks had convinced them they were impenetrable

[11:40:01] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> It's a ploy to get you to convert to exchange online
[11:40:35] <sd> 09<h​yseptik> For now we manage this in an Excel sheet, documenting domain, server, who bought the cert, who installed it, when it expires and so on
[11:41:15] <sd> 09<h​yseptik> We have notifications (going into our ticket system) for expiring certs, but would love to have a more robust docs system
[11:49:07] <csws> cert monitoring seems like one of those things where there's no real decent software
[11:49:17] <csws> a lot of people DIY it with excel
[11:49:26] <csws> or just wait until shit breaks then replace certs
[11:49:46] <Cl0udNinja> protip: dont let that happen on vcenter
[11:50:34] <csws> Cl0udNinja, do you have any vcsa 7 hosts?
[11:53:21] <Cl0udNinja> I dont manage our vcenter stuff anymore, but afaik we're only on 6.7
[11:53:43] <csws> oh.. for some reason it seems to send HSTS headers.. but maybe only sometimes?
[11:53:50] <csws> like it's stuffed on chrome but works fine on firefox
[11:53:56] <csws> anyway.. very annoying with a self signed cert

[12:18:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Well, I did recommend replacing bird level components with their authentic counter parts, but right now all we’re doing initially is just strapping more battery to the bank
[12:18:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> And the BMS design is a basic cheap one I’m familiar with
[12:18:35] <Cl0udNinja> from what I can tell at first glance is its a multiple PWM driver, and the 'speed' gotten from it is by using the multiple PWMs to control the one motor

[12:23:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I love how the fucking lcd driver is bigger then the chip that controls the whole damn thing
[12:24:31] <Cl0udNinja> probably a cost thing, the larger chip costs less than the more compact version of it
[12:24:49] <Cl0udNinja> I've seen some cases where the differences are even up to $1
[12:24:56] <Cl0udNinja> same chip different package
[12:25:20] <rpifan> my cubicleeee my cubicleee
[12:25:25] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Either way, since the BMS is “dumb” (no current metering etc - columb counter etc) just voltage safety means that the control unit is reading capacity based on voltage

[12:28:19] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I'm still convinced you're not gonna get any extra speed though, still doing exactly what I said it would be which is using multiple PWMs to pulse mosfets at varying times, or a varying number of fets based on the throttle position

[17:57:49] <SirSceptalot> yeah
[17:58:39] <SirSceptalot> obviously, it's no replacement for an actual toolkit, doing a long screw for instance is a bit tedious

[19:55:21] <CptLuxx> gawd

[19:56:50] <DArqueBishop> Kiernian: I had a team lead at HPE who had his home router forward port 3389 to his desktop PC so he could access it from work. One day he logged into it to catch an eBay scammer using it for his business.
[19:56:56] <Kiernian> flipped the forwarding off, changed the rule that did it AND the rule that APPARENTLY OPENED A FOUR THOUSAND PORT RANGE TO ANY and...wow...it stopped locking the account.
