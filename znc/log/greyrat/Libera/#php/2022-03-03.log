[00:00:21] <__adrian> you should not be using a ternary. does  echo "";  make sense?

[00:26:48] <qqqhhh861> hello what is the recommended way to use git with PHP development on web hosting? i have my PHP and git files on remote server but the problem is others see my ".git" directory and config in there. i am used to the workflow where i work with the files mounted though sshfs on the remote server and make changes, then refresh. Thanks.
[00:28:26] <__adrian> git is a local tool
[00:28:40] <__adrian> it doesn't have anything to do with where you deploy your code.
[00:28:48] <__adrian> use it on your desktop computer.
[00:29:11] <qqqhhh861> yes i want to use git with files locally on a sshfs mount, but the problem is the ".git" directory is visible on the server
[00:29:12] <__adrian> also sounds like you need a dev environment. a server (likely a VM or docker container) that looks a lot like your production server.
[00:29:29] <__adrian> local ≠ sshfs
[00:29:39] <__adrian> sshfs to where? hopefully not your production server.
[00:29:48] <qqqhhh861> it is a dev enviroment
[00:30:01] <qqqhhh861> prod will be deployed through gitlab pipeline
[00:30:02] <__adrian> then that's fine
[00:30:26] <__adrian> if you mean, a _shared_ dev env, then note that's not ideal
[00:30:46] <qqqhhh861> yes it is shared, but my colleague wants to use git too, but my ".git" folder is already there
[00:31:08] <__adrian> right. that's one reason it's not ideal.
[00:31:20] <qqqhhh861> so it is not possible to work that way?
[00:31:22] <__adrian> also, more obviously, the two of you can't work at the same time.
[00:31:29] <__adrian> it's very non-ideal
[00:32:30] <qqqhhh861> maybe there is a way to have the ".git" folder elsewhere ?
[00:32:39] <__adrian> if i had to share a dev env, i'd work on code locally (actually locally) and then deploy to the dev env to test. much easier to not step on other people's toes.
[00:32:50] <__adrian> the git folder is not the problem
[00:33:02] <Albright> I would suggest setting up a repo on GitHub or what have you as a common "origin" repo for you and your colleague. When you want to deploy from the server, one of you goes to the server and pulls from the origin repo instead of pushing to it.
[00:33:08] <__adrian> the problem is having multiple people trying to use the same dev env
[00:33:41] <qqqhhh861> locally i have an older version of debian and the packages don't match , i cannot use local apache
[00:33:44] <__adrian> the fact that your shared dev env is also a shared code editing env makes it worse.
[00:34:05] <qqqhhh861> i see
[00:34:18] <__adrian> (a) you can certainly make a local dev env. a local dev is NOT on your desktop OS. it's a VM or docker container.
[00:34:51] <__adrian> (b) i'm not talking about a local dev env. i'm talking about a local copy of the repo that you work on, and the can deploy to the dev env as needed to test.
[00:35:21] <__adrian> that way you can at least say "heh are you using the dev env? i'm going to mess with it for an hour or so"
[00:35:59] <__adrian> now, if there's any way you _can_ have your own dev env, you should definitely do that also.
[00:36:07] <__adrian> but, separate suggestions.
[00:36:56] <qqqhhh861> are you suggesting a local docker enviroment where i work the same way? so i would then sshfs into the container?
[00:38:06] <qqqhhh861> i already work in a VM so for me it seems reinstalling the dev VM to the same version as DEV is a simpler and long term solution
[00:38:35] <Albright> Does anyone have any thoughts on async libraries? Basically looking to offload some database calls that we don't need to wait for a response for (and if they fail it's not the end of the world).

[00:39:29] <qqqhhh861> __adrian: i wanted to avoid that but it seems the only good solution, thanks for your help
[00:39:33] <__adrian> * if you already have a dev VM that you can use, then definitely
[00:39:55] <__adrian> * if you're using docker you don't need to sshfs. you can just mount the code folder.
[00:40:04] <qqqhhh861> __adrian: no i work on my own dev VM on my pc, that is separate from the DEV environment
[00:40:21] <Sayona> Hi, can anyone help me with this https://paste.laravel.io/6c21cd01-d9dd-4239-91c3-9ba5739f067b , I don't see where is the issue "syntax error, unexpected token \"=>\", expecting \"]\"" ....
[00:41:05] <__adrian> Sayona: which line?
[00:41:16] <Sayona> "image" => $image_upload;
[00:41:21] <Albright> Sayona: yeah, that syntax is all wrong. What are you trying to do? append values to $finalValues?
[00:41:29] <Sayona> if I comment it give me the second one
[00:41:32] <__adrian> mm hm. and what is that line nested under?
[00:41:48] <Sayona> ah
[00:41:51] <__adrian> (what's on the line above?)
[00:43:14] <ordos> Albright, sounds more like an architectural pattern is needed - something like a message queue or pub/sub model?
[00:43:34] <Sayona> I fix it
[00:43:36] <__adrian> Albright: job queue
[00:43:36] <Sayona> thanks __adrian
[00:43:56] <__adrian> Sayona: welcome
[00:44:17] <Albright> Inserting into a queue still involves a synchronous DB call.

[00:47:31] <__adrian> nothing to do with coding
[00:47:33] <Albright> but yes
[00:48:18] <Albright> :D Yes, nothing to do with coding, but it is the standard approach to modern PHP config on servers.
[00:49:16] <__adrian> wrt your situation, it still needs to be properly configured, like any other sapi.
[00:49:21] <ordos> Albright, depending on what tool you pick, you can likely configure message queue to utilise in-memory cache, and later write persistent messages to disk, but at this stage we're talking significantly large volumes, I'd be surprised if a basic DB queue wouldn't do the trick
[00:50:05] <ordos> unless these volumes explain Visa and Mastercard wanting your attentiobn ;-)

[07:42:09] <Rockwood> i am bit confuse about session and cookies
[07:42:47] <Rockwood> suppose if i reload the web page its mean all things will be refresh
[07:43:29] <Blondie101010> it depends on how you define and identify sessions
[07:44:01] <Blondie101010> if you use PHP's default session handler, it uses a session cookie, which is controlled by your browser
[07:44:55] <Blondie101010> that complicates things for an API design
[07:47:15] <Rockwood> https://dpaste.com/2YFRQ8K3L i am trying to implement this way
[07:47:51] <Rockwood> here i am setting up cookies and session

[07:48:10] <Rockwood> at time login submit its fine
[07:48:29] <Rockwood> but when i am going to refresh the page its creating issue
[07:48:55] <Rockwood> really i am very frustrated
[07:49:09] <Rockwood> by my lack of knowledge
[07:51:48] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  I think what you're saying is that your problem is that you're not keeping state on the server like you would if you were dealing with a plain PHP "page"
[07:52:29] <Rockwood> i am dealing with js as frontend
[07:52:30] <Blondie101010> that is indeed something to consider in your application design
[07:53:18] <Rockwood> if i use backend php and frontend as html then no problem to handle that
[07:53:37] <Rockwood> templating confusing me
[07:53:41] <Blondie101010> if you need to keep track of things, you must ensure that the front-end sends the information to the server, and that the server handles it properly (store data in DB)
[07:54:48] <Rockwood> just in case of auth i am facing this problem other things works as i am trying
[07:55:25] <Rockwood> js isn't good place to store anything
[07:55:32] <Rockwood> this is the main issue
[07:55:34] <Blondie101010> if your API request needs to be authenticated, it needs to include a token or signature to prove it
[07:55:52] <Rockwood> i am attaching csrf

[09:08:50] <on3pk> quota limits on the API system, and when an API call is made a gearman job is spun up to let the user console app know
[09:09:20] <on3pk> it just seems like that's a very brittle system
[09:10:44] <on3pk> Now, something to consider is I have no users and if I ever actually do release, it'll probably be free in some capacity.

[17:04:33] <ordos> NakedKing, are you building all this for fun to teach yourself OOP in PHP? Or are you building this crypto wallet because it's something you're intending to use in production?

[17:14:55] <The_Blode> From a design point, would you include sub classes within the main class or split them out?

[17:16:10] <__adrian> np
[17:16:22] <__adrian> does your Task just carry info around? or does it "do" something?
[17:16:26] <The_Blode> So I've got functions already for the task stuff...but a Class makes more sense.
[17:16:33] <The_Blode> It will write to a log
[17:16:47] <The_Blode> So a method like set_task($task_name);
[17:17:35] <__adrian> seems like $name is necessary - it ought to be passed on construct

[17:17:59] <The_Blode> One thing though, if I create the object without passing name, what happens?
[17:18:01] <__adrian> the point of __construct() is to do all the setup things that are necessary for the new object to be usable.

[17:21:23] <The_Blode> Actually, in my app, Task has two mandatory properties, $task_type and $task_name
[17:21:33] <The_Blode> So I should initialise these firt
[17:22:44] <The_Blode> Also, just your professional experience please on this...it's not PHP specific but...when defining function names or method names...camelCase or lower_with_underscore

[17:30:25] <The_Blode> PSR2 seems to be deprecated though

[18:48:02] <Naktibalda> if you redirect from one domain to another, you could pass session id as parameter, but it is dangerous
[18:48:24] <olle> Naktibalda: We were thinking temp token for that, and use Redis for that token instead of session.
[18:48:35] <olle> Naktibalda: Do you know a simple SSO system when you own both machines?

[22:03:14] <AllenJB> Northwoods: With regards to your original error message, my guess would be that the xsl extension depends on the dom extension, so you need to make sure that's loaded first.

[22:03:48] <AllenJB> Most distros will automatically manage the order extensions load (note the number prefixes on the extension specific ini files)
[22:04:31] <AllenJB> You generally should not have to manually add extension= lines to php.ini files. On some distros you need to use tools such as phpenmod to enable modules separate of installing the packages for them
[22:05:05] <Northwoods> yes i am using ubuntu 16.04

[22:30:04] <AllenJB> It's not going to be doing exactly the same thing tho. A simple example: Even if you're suppressing them, I believe PHP warnings and deprecation notices can impact performance, and those will certainly have changed between 7.2 and 7.4 (I wouldn't expect that alone to create a large difference tho, unless there's a lot of them)
