[03:03:52] <John_Ivan> hi. I'm running a systemd unit/service as root in order to modify xinput (has some xinput calls). calling my script with sudo or root directly works. however when it runs under systemd, journalctl says "Cannot connext to X server." any ideas?
[03:04:31] <ThothCastel> I am getting the below error when trying to mount something which was mounting just fine
[03:04:31] <ThothCastel> https://paste.centos.org/view/1986561d
[03:04:44] <phogg> John_Ivan: you must set the DISPLAY env var in order for the command to know which X to connect to, and even then xauth must be configured to allow the connection
[03:05:05] <phogg> John_Ivan: if you google for people having problems connecting to X from cron jobs the solutions are the same
[03:05:29] <John_Ivan> phogg, sure, but given that both my user and root can run it directly, what makes systemd calling a unit as the root user any different?
[03:05:40] <e36freak> _Ev: .* is greedy, it'll keep going as long as it can until the last > on the line
[03:05:49] <e36freak> so you need to say "anything that's not a >"
[03:05:56] <phogg> John_Ivan: either one can *start* X, but that doesn't mean either is permitted to connect to a running instance
[03:06:05] <Lemniscate> ThothCastel, is the server you're NFS'ing to running?
[03:06:13] <ThothCastel> yep
[03:06:40] <John_Ivan> phogg, I see. even if root/my user ran the command and were permitted, despite X already running?
[03:06:42] <Lemniscate> ThothCastel, and does the referenced directory exist? ssh to it to confirm.
[03:06:51] <ThothCastel> yes
[03:06:56] <phogg> John_Ivan: the key difference is the environment. You're running a script from an environment which does not descend from the environment that launched X, so the env vars that are required are not set
[03:07:01] <ThothCastel> i have tried restarting the nfs on server
[03:07:30] <John_Ivan> phogg, right. alright then. thanks.

[03:46:09] <siwica> I have n MACVLAN network interfaces with only the link-local IPv6 address configured on each of them. Is it possible to create n UDP sockets that receive packets addressed to both the respective link-local IPv6 address and to two IPv6 multicast addresses simultaneously? When I bind the n sockets to the respective link local address I don't receive multicast packets despite joining the respective multicast group. When I bin
[03:46:09] <siwica> sockets to :: (all Ipv6 addresses) it so happens that the unicast packets to a link local address end up getting received on a seemingly random socket. I set SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT for all interfaces in both scenarios.

[04:20:13] <tsapien> a better comparision would be something like nano vs vim

[04:39:53] <tinyweasel> so, I was wondering
[04:40:03] <tinyweasel> if I did SWAP on RAID 10 of NVMe SSDs, could it be as fast as memory in general?
[04:40:07] <rannnn8888> .strftime("%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S") k thxx
[04:40:13] <[[R]]> tinyweasel: no
[04:40:15] <tinyweasel> because 200GB SWAP VPSes would be fun
[04:40:17] <tinyweasel> hmm... yeah
[04:40:22] <tinyweasel> if it was just fast enough, then maybe
[04:40:27] <tangy> so I'm putting a formal backups routine together, no encryption, raid 1 and ext4 across 2 hard drives and some flash drives. for testing, I'm tring to create ~125 64MB partitions on a flash drive with `sfdisk`, which returned 0. So now, `fdisk -l` knows about the partitions, but they aren't in the /dev/sdc### file system yet. any idea of what I'm missing here?

[05:55:34] <Psi-Jack> You will not "find the root password".
[05:55:39] <lobotomite> is it possible there's anything in the zImage, u-boot.img, or anything in the boot partition that would flash this root password on mount
[05:55:41] <Psi-Jack> YOu can only set a new one.

[06:51:35] <ayecee> i can't pull that out from there
[06:52:03] <_Ev> In other words.. You can't point your registers DNS servers to you WHM nameservers because if you have no domain fixed on your WHM cpanel then you cannot create the hostnames to point the registers nameservers to....

[10:46:16] <hexnewbie> C0nundrum: So, um, since LVM does not have a failure mode in which it corrupts *itself* and this manner, and since you mentioned testdisk, what did you do to get to this state? Cause either the LV layout is wrong (mistaken vgcfgrestore?), or something wrote the /boot block device over the / block device (mistaken dd, error during new OS installation?)?
[10:46:40] <C0nundrum> yea the restore command
[10:47:05] <C0nundrum> Bad cobination of that and fsck.ext4 -fry i think
[10:47:07] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
[10:47:13] <C0nundrum> Is it recoverable ?
[10:47:18] <hexnewbie> Hmmfp, vgcfgrestore can be destructive when you give it the wrong disk or the wrong config to restore
[10:47:56] <C0nundrum> If there is a program to search files, what if it found the internal lvm metadata on the missing partition
[10:48:09] <C0nundrum> couldn't i use that to restore the proper tables
[10:48:18] <C0nundrum> Or is there a easier way
[10:48:30] <hexnewbie> Recoverable? Very likely, since that only overwrote the metadata (and even if it did touch the data, it ought to be fsck-repairable). HOWEVER, it would involve finding a copy of the correct config, and using vgcfgrestore correctly (correct config, correct PV)

[18:41:22] <^-^hi> we agree but disagree on agreement

[18:41:33] <matsaman> I can see your POV, yes
[18:41:37] <zamnedix> flatpak is easily the best out of the appimage, flatpak, snap lineup. using it feels like using a package manager.
[18:41:45] <zamnedix> its nice for things like new firefox on debian stable imo
[18:42:04] <matsaman> the point is that upstreams offer flatpak because of a fundamental flaw in their system, and not that end users _choose_ flatpak because it's _one_ of many options
[18:42:05] *** Joins: progandy (~progandy@user/progandy)

[18:43:05] <matsaman> the reason appimage isn't good is the same reason they all aren't: you're trusting some rando stranger to build a clean FS for you

[19:52:14] <Psi-Jack> Trieste: Anyway. For file level replication, on commodity hardware, I do generally use GlusterFS and/or NFSv4. Specifically if the backend is replicated with RAID-5 or better.
[19:53:29] <Psi-Jack> For larger deployments, I would still recommend Ceph, but you need dedicated high end hardware, lots of RAM, and tiers of SSD and HDD's for large amounts of storage capacity with reasonable reliability and speed. Without the RAM to back it up, you're going to run into non-stop issues.

[21:19:06] <nomagno> Functional = turing complete. HTML is (By a hilarious definition, but still) turing complete. CSS is turing complete. JavaScript is, unfortunately turing complete. Lisp is definitely turing complete

[23:03:18] <Blondie101010> is it because you run CPU intensive stuff, or fill the RAM, or whatever else?

I will simply read the analog input from a file (Preferrably a named pipe to get around IO slowdowns), and I can implement the 'drivers' however I wish.
