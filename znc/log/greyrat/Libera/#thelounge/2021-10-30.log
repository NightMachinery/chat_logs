[04:34:03] <brettgilio> Windows. Let me see if I can replicate it on Debian or not

[04:44:10] <johncs> Oh I mentioned the PR
[04:44:31] <brettgilio> is that branch on top of current master?
[04:44:35] <johncs> I just rebased
[04:44:36] <johncs> Yes
[04:44:51] <brettgilio> cool, gonna test current behavior on debian first then will apply that branch

[04:58:28] <brettgilio> (that I found)
[04:59:18] <brettgilio> MaxLeiter can we merge that branch?
[04:59:22] <johncs> Cool, thanks for confirming brettgilio. I think we've been hoping that we'll hear back from SortableJS's maintainer about getting our upstream fix merged and a new release sent
[04:59:36] <brettgilio> ahhh... so its above our tree then
[04:59:39] <brettgilio> well, shoot
[04:59:49] <johncs> Yeah, the patch I gave you added a dependency on my fork of SortableJS
[05:00:28] <johncs> But that's not a totally unreasonable thing to do, so I might add that commit to the PR and see how folks feel about bringing it in
[05:00:33] <brettgilio> well, i'm going to run off your branch until it hopefully gets fixed lol
[05:00:47] <brettgilio> thanks for doing that
[05:01:03] <brettgilio> it's weird to me that sortablejs is the problem here
[05:01:12] <brettgilio> but, then again, im not a JS person so *shrug*
[05:03:11] <johncs> I removed the right click behavior for Android intentionally with an earlier change. But my Android detection apparently activates on Windows Edge as well (and now I know also Windows Chrome). So the bug is mine. Fixing my newly created bug while still retaining the new feature my earlier change introduced requires a fix to SortableJS though.
[05:03:52] <johncs> A little complex 😅, hopefully I laid that out alright.
[05:04:17] <brettgilio> Browsers are complex...
[05:04:51] <johncs> They really are 😭
[05:05:11] <brettgilio> I applaud you all for even bothering to deal with them
[05:05:18] <brettgilio> I'll stick to C and OCaml
[05:06:55] <johncs> haha nothing wrong with that
[05:07:42] <brettgilio> thanks for your help again, johncs

[05:09:56] <brettgilio> it's an unfortunate side effect of my IT dept not letting me install linux lol
[05:10:12] <brettgilio> so, im glad there was a benefit to windows for once
[05:13:43] <brettgilio> unrelated, yjftsjthsd3 "162.127.123.34.bc.googleusercontent.com" is that a google vps?

[12:48:12] <easymac> discord conventions might be worth copying 
[12:48:43] <easymac> it's markdown, mostly
[12:49:12] <bookworm> johncs: no, I'm one off them and can confidently say no ;)
[12:50:46] <bookworm> I have all the color codes disabled anyhow in my theme and I very much don't want to send them
[12:52:17] <johncs> Yeah I think Discord does what the issue suggested. No need to deviate from them. I think IRC cloud did the same.
[12:52:22] <easymac> *italics*, **bold**, __underline__,  ~~strikethrough~~, ||spoiler||, `monospace`
[12:52:55] <easymac> it's especially nice for mobile 
[12:54:32] <easymac> i wouldn't mind if > quotes were formatted too
[12:54:57] <johncs> I was surprised that many IRC clients support spoilers already
[12:55:09] <johncs> At least enough to be mentioned in the "spec"
[12:55:37] <johncs> I saw mention in irc cloud of > quotes. Didn't try it yet. Seems like it might only be appropriate if the server supports multiline messages.
[12:56:56] <easymac> re: that thread, parsing markdown from messages seems like a different matter
[12:57:04] <johncs> yeah that seems like a bad idea
[12:57:18] <johncs> there's already a way to encode the formatting in IRC
[12:57:32] <johncs> It's just wildly inaccessible
[13:03:49] <easymac> i'm not aware of anything similar for colors. the autocomplete components might be sufficient--could pair it with markdown-type characters both to trigger the menu and to demarcate color blocks. does irccloud have something like that?

[13:04:29] <johncs> I'm not sure, but tbh I don't know that we need to support arbitrary colors. I feel like it's a mostly disliked feature.
[13:04:47] <easymac> sorry, i just meant as a text input option for basic color formatting 
[13:05:00] <easymac> something like ::color-grey:the text string:: double colon to terminate 
[13:05:08] <easymac> something markdown-inspired

[13:05:40] <easymac> i guess it's kind of just "short"hand for the existing formatting codes
[13:06:07] <johncs> That's what I was referring to. But I guess it's probably best to just support all the formatting possible.
[13:06:25] <easymac> ah, i thought you meant arbitrary as in hex
[13:06:35] <johncs> ah for sure
[13:07:02] <johncs> <grey>hello</grey> could work 🤷‍♀️. Bonus points for being actual markdown.
[13:07:16] <easymac> you're probably right. i very rarely see humans type in color. just bots 
[13:09:08] <johncs> I think starting off with just the parser and a /md command to do it would probably be a good first step.
[13:10:01] <johncs> Then could do the integration into the actual text input as a separate piece, since that'll be complicated in its own right.
[13:10:45] <easymac> yeah, & there might be more related functionality to add to the input box 
[13:11:01] <easymac> not that i can think of any right now
[13:11:20] <johncs> I think it'll be important to show the user how their text is being parsed
[13:11:36] <johncs> Just like what discord does, where *hello* gets bolded in the message box before you send it.
[13:11:42] <easymac> yeah absolutely 
[13:11:54] <easymac> and being able to \*escape\* :)
[13:12:00] <johncs> Which means the text box needs to become a content editable element 😭
[13:12:38] <johncs> Or something... never made a rich text input before. I wonder what the way to do it nowadays is.
[13:13:24] <easymac> contenteditable is how discord does it
[13:14:17] <johncs> welp. Well we'll see if I or someone ever gets to implementing that
[13:14:30] <easymac> i've seen people use transparent inputs over the top of the formatted result for some things, but for this it'd cause problems with text selection
[13:14:54] <johncs> Ah yeah I've had to do that sort of thing for my current work project
[13:15:16] <johncs> laying over a text box over a canvas to edit text that's normally rendered in there
[13:15:23] <johncs> alignment is no fun
