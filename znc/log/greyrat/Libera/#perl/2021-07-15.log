[18:23:18] <sozuba> hi, i want to install some perl modules for a program (in this case its urxvt), should is install it at "/usr/lib/urxvt/perl/" or /usr/ib/perl5/5.34/urxvt/ ? i know its usually a personal preference, but since i am new to perl and stuff, I want to know the standard or the normal convention or safe/best practice scenario. please advise

[18:23:49] <LeoNerd> For use by any perl

[20:16:29] <veesh> well, it must be if i didn't realize it existed til now
[20:16:50] <veesh> i frequently do want to do an assignment only if something is truthy
[20:18:48] <Grinnz> ||= and //= are useful for providing defaults due to their shortcircuiting guarantee, &&= doesn't quite have the same use
[20:19:38] <Grinnz> length-or is the missing one when it comes to defaults
[20:23:21] <rewt> eval: $x = 0; $x &&= 42; $y = 1; $y &&= 42; [ $x, $y ]
[20:23:22] <perlbot> rewt: [0,42]
[20:23:46] <Botje-> $valid &&= $some->check
[20:24:33] <Botje-> but then you often want to know which check failed, so &&= is less useful

[20:25:50] <Grinnz> yeah, it would only be specifically useful when the thing you're assigning to is something you want to assign to if it's already true
[20:26:17] <Grinnz> so i could see &&= 1 to coerce true values to 1, for instance
[20:26:25] <Grinnz> just not very idiomatic
[20:26:27] *** Quits: semeion (~semeion@user/semeion) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:27:43] <thrig> maybe to change a unit vector into a magnitude or the other way around
[20:29:12] <rindolf> veesh: Grinnz : Botje- : &&= should be there for completeness' sake
[20:30:34] <veesh> i use it when munging a value for a nullable column in my db
[20:30:39] <veesh> like when processing dates that are optional
[20:30:59] <veesh> *would use it, had I realized its existence
[20:31:18] <veesh> $date &&= normalize $date
[20:33:16] <Grinnz> i would need defined-and or length-and for that case, usually
[20:33:27] <Grinnz> but honestly, it's not worth taking up more syntax for
[20:33:32] <Grinnz> too confusing
[20:34:53] <rewt> defined-and would be && in italics?

[22:53:34] <vanfanel64> Was on the news. Florida man on the 4th of july, was setting up fireworks on top of his septic tank, was standing with a bundle on the access lid when it gave just as he lit the bundle. He fell inside the tank, and then the fireworks went off. He laid in there unconscious for several hours before waking up, burned and smelling awful
[23:03:22] <gordonfish> I heard about another story recently where florida man set off fireworks from a boat and hit his own house.
[23:03:47] <gchristensen> as a florida man I've had someone across the pond shoot off firework,s have them fall over, and shoot fireworks int o my house
[23:04:12] <vanfanel64> What is it with Florida man? Why is it never any other state, just florida that all these stories seem to come from?
[23:04:27] <gordonfish> gchristensen: Oh crap
[23:04:35] <vanfanel64> That is awful
[23:04:37] <gchristensen> Florida has extremely strict laws about transparent police logs
[23:05:08] <vanfanel64> What the hell are the cops eating?
[23:05:15] <genio> All I can assure you is that it wasn't me
[23:05:47] <genio> *you of
[23:05:56] <gordonfish> Came up with this, apologies to any sane Floridians: (Sung to Particle Man by TMBG) Florida Man, Florida Man, doing the craziest things that he can. What's his psych? It's not important. Florida Man.
[23:05:57] <genio> Meh. I'll learn to English one day
[23:06:06] <gordonfish> Is he a douche? Or is he a simp. When in a septic tank does he get wet? Or does the fireworks get him instead? You don't wanna know, Florida Man.
[23:06:48] <vanfanel64> Hah
[23:08:01] <gordonfish> As someone who has a septic system, I definitely would want to fall in there.
[23:08:05] <gordonfish> woulkd NOT 
[23:08:07] <gordonfish> ug
[23:08:15] <vanfanel64> lol
[23:08:28] <gordonfish> :(
[23:13:03] <gordonfish> Closest I've come to falling in was when I had to change the sumersible pump one a few years ago. It was all done from above, didn't have to actually go in. Just had to be careful not to drop the pump, land it in the correct place.
[23:14:57] <gordonfish> Re: <simcop2387> gordonfish: yea, there's weird snippets of "culture" that i think we've lost to history now but i kinda wish we had. that's one reason that one of the places i donate to is archive.org. i feel like that's going to be something incredibly important for future humans
