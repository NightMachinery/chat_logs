[12:54:13] <Faux> Hi!
[12:55:06] <Juliu> me.numFriends++
[12:56:04] <Juliu> So I want to learn how to code to get rich quick. Is that a good idea?
[12:57:20] <Faux> If you're in an area where tech workers are massively overpaid, then probably, yeah.
[12:57:59] <Juliu> I don't think so
[12:58:17] *** Joins: KillAnimals (~anon@199.119.235.162)
[12:58:26] <Juliu> So you have to be massively overpaid to get rich?
[12:58:53] <KillAnimals> Juliu: This chat is offtopic only. Please take your discussion to #c++-general
[12:59:14] <Juliu> KillAnimals, are you fucking kidding me? They told me to come here
[13:00:00] <Juliu> What if I code something cool and then sell it?
[13:00:41] <T`aZ> lol
[13:00:47] <T`aZ> getting rich while working
[13:00:56] <T`aZ> what a noob, this is not how life works
[13:01:20] <KillAnimals> It'd be nice to make money. 
[13:02:08] <Juliu> I could code a virtual girlfriend and sell it. Because that is clearly what a lot of guys on IRC would need
[13:02:25] <KillAnimals> Juliu: Are you a girl?
[13:02:52] <Juliu> T`aZ, you think getting rich from working is too easy, and I should try to get rich from not doing anything? Good plan. Teach me how, sensei
[13:02:59] <Juliu> KillAnimals, are you a girl?
[13:03:09] <KillAnimals> Juliu: Thank god, no.
[13:03:17] <KillAnimals> What about you?
[13:03:29] <Juliu> No, I'm not a girl
[13:04:04] <Juliu> Do people not get paid for coding?
[13:04:20] <KillAnimals> Juliu: Depends. Do you pay yourself?
[13:04:38] <Juliu> I don't have enough money to employ me
[13:05:02] <KillAnimals> I'd never work for someone that would hire a person like me anyways.
[13:05:28] <Juliu> I would also not work for someone who would hire you
[13:05:41] <KillAnimals> Juliu: Are you actually wanting to learn how to code?
[13:06:00] <Juliu> KillAnimals, yes! If you have 5 minutes left, please teach me
[13:06:17] <Juliu> I am trying to code something since 3 years, but it's not working :(
[13:06:39] <KillAnimals> Wdym?
[13:06:46] <Juliu> ?
[13:07:02] <KillAnimals> I don't have a sense of humour so you have to just be straight with me.
[13:07:03] <Juliu> I mean, it doesn't work
[13:07:17] <Juliu> I am always straight

[13:08:02] <KillAnimals> In what language?
[13:08:12] <Juliu> C++ ?
[13:08:31] <KillAnimals> show me a block of your code. Just a function definition.
[13:08:34] <Juliu> Actually I program in ++C, it's more efficient
[13:08:53] <Juliu> func()
[13:09:12] <KillAnimals> Juliu: I've met you before. You are a carbon copy of DiffieHellman.
[13:09:29] <Juliu> I have never met them in person
[13:09:34] <KillAnimals> #sqt
[13:09:53] <Juliu> But it's actually true, my code doesn't work
[13:09:59] <KillAnimals> I'm banned from there but that person is exactly like you. 
[13:10:21] <Juliu> I want to write a program that tells me if you can read node B from node A in a directed graph
[13:10:37] <Juliu> I don't know where "there" is
[13:10:44] <KillAnimals> #sqt
[13:10:47] <Juliu> *read = reach
[13:10:50] <KillAnimals>  /j #sqt
[13:10:55] <Juliu> What is #sqt ?
[13:11:06] <KillAnimals> Juliu: 4chan general for /g/
[13:11:18] <Juliu> I also don't know what /g/ is, sorry
[13:11:35] <KillAnimals> Juliu: Do you know where reddit is?
[13:11:41] <Juliu> Anyway, can we please focus on my problem? The 5 minutes are almost over
[13:11:52] <Juliu> I've never been on reddit or 4chan
[13:12:14] <KillAnimals>  /g/ is the technology board of 4chan.
[13:12:31] <Juliu> Ok. 4chan isn't IRC but a forum, right?
[13:12:44] <KillAnimals> Its an annonymous image board, yes.
[13:12:57] <Juliu> Ok. So why are you talking about that? Please focus
[13:13:03] <KillAnimals> Its a magical place that you should never goto.
[13:13:09] <Juliu> Good
[13:13:23] <KillAnimals> Because you remind me exactly of DiffieHellman, from #sqt, from /g/, from 4chan.
[13:13:33] <Juliu> Ok
[13:13:43] <KillAnimals> he can help you.
[13:13:58] <Juliu> Did they have the same problem I just described?
[13:14:18] <KillAnimals> DiffieHellman has no problems.
[13:14:34] <Juliu> I bet in reality you are Diffie or Hellman yourself
[13:14:56] <KillAnimals> Juliu: No. I don't have a sense of humour. 
[13:15:09] <Juliu> But you are so cryptic
[13:15:24] <KillAnimals> And people don't like me. Everyone likes DiffieHellman.
[13:15:39] <Juliu> I like people who can help me with my problem
[13:15:52] <KillAnimals> Then you like DiffieHellman.
[13:15:59] <Juliu> Whatever
[13:16:07] <Juliu> I bet you can't even code
[13:16:19] <KillAnimals> I can. 
[13:16:32] <Juliu> Can you code what I just described?
[13:16:39] <KillAnimals> You are just mad because I am more cryptic than you are.
[13:16:55] <Juliu> You are not as cryptic as DiffieHellman
[13:17:40] <KillAnimals> nah, DiffieHellman is pretty straightforward.
[13:18:00] <Juliu> This does not help with my problem
[13:19:03] <Juliu> KillAnimals, still there?
[13:19:09] <KillAnimals> You just want to graph two things?
[13:19:18] <Juliu> What? No
[13:19:28] <Juliu> I want a function that returns yes or no
[13:19:47] <KillAnimals> that can't be done.
[13:19:48] <KillAnimals> sorry
[13:19:52] <KillAnimals> use python instead
[13:19:53] <Juliu> What??
[13:20:05] <Juliu> Why do you say it can't be done?
[13:20:22] <Juliu> Python is for idiots
[13:20:34] <KillAnimals> and?
[13:20:44] <Juliu> And it does not matter which language I use
[13:21:11] <KillAnimals> Then use python. 
[13:21:23] <Juliu> Fine, then teach me how do solve my problem in python
[13:21:32] <KillAnimals> I don't know how to use python.
[13:21:43] <Juliu> Then teach me in C++
[13:21:50] <KillAnimals> It can't be done.
[13:21:50] <Juliu> ++C if you prefer
[13:21:58] <Juliu> or +C+, who cares
[13:22:09] <Juliu> Why do you say it can't be done? :(
[13:22:24] <KillAnimals> Why do you ask me tautologies?
[13:22:39] <Juliu> Why do you behave like a bot?
[13:22:56] <KillAnimals> Because I have no emotions.
[13:23:03] <Juliu> and no brain
[13:23:10] <KillAnimals> No, I have that. 
[13:23:19] <KillAnimals> Any man with emotions, is a woman.
[13:23:25] <Juliu> Do you know how a DFS works?
[13:23:55] <Juliu> Can a DFS be done?
[13:23:56] <T`aZ> not sure why a guy that cant navigate a graph thinks python is for idiots but .. , ok
[13:23:57] <KillAnimals> Acronymns stand for something.
[13:24:23] <Juliu> T`aZ, can you teach me how to do it?
[13:24:27] <KillAnimals> T`aZ: Python is for idiots.
[13:24:35] <Juliu> KillAnimals, DFS = Depth First Search
[13:24:56] <KillAnimals> Juliu: I don't bother with superstitious nonsense like that.
[13:25:14] <Juliu> KillAnimals, I think you can't even code
[13:25:20] <Juliu> T`aZ, help!
[13:25:27] <T`aZ> Juliu: im sure thare are proper courses or books that will teach you how better than me
[13:25:35] <T`aZ> there*
[13:25:38] <Juliu> T`aZ, I don't read books
[13:25:46] <T`aZ> the stfu and go flip burgers
[13:25:49] <Juliu> And there is no book that coveres what I want
[13:25:53] <T`aZ> lol
[13:25:55] <KillAnimals> Juliu: The first book you should read is K&R
[13:26:00] <Juliu> Books are for idiots :)

[13:26:40] <Juliu> T`aZ, could you write such a program as I described?
[13:27:04] <KillAnimals> My god. You want to program and you use windows? 
[13:27:05] <Juliu> KillAnimals, my Windows is working ok. I don't see any reason to switch
[13:27:32] <KillAnimals> And why would you rely on your incredulity when you are well aware of your own limitations?
[13:27:45] <Juliu> What?
