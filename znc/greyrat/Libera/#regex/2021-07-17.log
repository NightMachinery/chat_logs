[11:55:22] <ChrisM> So I spent hours getting my regex subtition perfect in regex101 but when I go to use the same values in the regex search and replace of my text editor, it does not format it anything like it says it is supposed to on regex101?...
[11:55:24] <ChrisM> https://regex101.com/r/nqTi2o/1
[12:01:26] <karhunkynsii> Maybe your editor is using a different regex flavour.
[12:01:34] <karhunkynsii> Or a unicode issue?
[12:01:54] <karhunkynsii> You can try .+ instead of that 100 thing.
[12:02:17] <karhunkynsii> What editor are you using?
[12:03:33] <ChrisM> I think it is an issue with my regex not accounting for code that doesn't have a " as the first character in the line
[12:03:33] *** Quits: I-M (~id@78.183.101.98) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:05:03] <ChrisM> Here it is again with the full code I am trying to substitute...
[12:05:05] <ChrisM> https://regex101.com/r/F3lZMF/1
[12:06:36] <ChrisM> Actually this one is the way I had it... https://regex101.com/r/w4e3gI/1 The previous link was after I started messing with it again...
[12:07:22] <karhunkynsii> As a result you want just the parts you're looking for?
[12:07:59] <ChrisM> Yes
[12:08:28] <karhunkynsii> Ok, so then you need to match everything else, and replace with parts you want. Or,
[12:08:53] <karhunkynsii> Find the parts you want and send them to a second regex.
[12:09:20] <karhunkynsii> Or just loop through the matches.
[12:09:30] <karhunkynsii> (And not do a substitution.)
[12:09:50] <ChrisM> I'm not the best at regex, do you mind editing it for me?
[12:10:41] <karhunkynsii> Hm, since we're reorganizing the parts you want, i'd say it would be best to use regexes.
[12:12:23] <karhunkynsii> Using two regexes is fine, yes?
[12:12:43] <ChrisM> Yea

[12:15:28] <karhunkynsii> But just these two variables?
[12:16:50] <ChrisM> Yeah but I don't want to replace the variable names just the stuff inside the [""] but some of them do not have the square brackets on the same line and therefore only have something in double quotes on the line...
[12:17:13] <karhunkynsii> You want the surrounding code?
[12:18:01] <ChrisM> Nope

[13:33:57] <ChrisM> Whoops didn't mean to post it again lol
[13:33:57] <digitok> ok, calm down
[13:34:08] <karhunkynsii> ChrisM, we're missing some targets.
[13:34:24] <re101-zorse-31> digitok I need to run it on a very large amount of data but only 1 time
[13:34:42] <ChrisM> 🤦‍♂️
[13:34:59] <digitok> well as long as you're not using a global match, it shouldn't be too inefficient
[13:35:08] <digitok> assuming all of the fields will always exist
[13:35:33] <ChrisM> Ahh Yeah AOE is still in front
[13:35:44] <ChrisM> And Target

[13:35:58] <karhunkynsii> Yeah.
[13:36:07] <ChrisM> And Random Target
[13:36:14] <re101-zorse-31> digitok, it needs to also support if there's a null in the field please
[13:36:19] <ChrisM> All the A1 ones look good I think
[13:36:56] <digitok> for all fields?
[13:37:53] <re101-zorse-31> for all the fields I need captured, because when there is null there isn't a " before it like when there is a match
[13:39:09] <digitok> yea i just meant whether all of the fields can be null
[13:39:13] <digitok> i assume so
[13:39:22] <re101-zorse-31> yes
[13:40:01] <digitok> if the value is null, is it enough that the group isn't returned
[13:40:08] <digitok> i.e. you don't need to capture null
[13:41:36] <digitok> <re101-zorse-31> yes
[13:41:38] <digitok> great

[13:43:37] <re101-zorse-31> perfect, ty 
[13:43:50] <re101-zorse-31> lol let me check it ill let you know, but thanks I appreciate it!
[13:44:16] <digitok> yw :) back soon hehe
[13:44:52] <ChrisM> What do you recommend I use if I have too much stuff to paste into the test string in regex101?
[13:45:48] <ChrisM> It always times out on me
[13:46:29] <re101-zorse-31> digitok last thing, can you do that in substitution it would only print the captures including the field name? i.e print "full_name":"karl morgan","linkedin_url":"linkedin.com/in/karl-morgan-60765316" and so on https://regex101.com/r/XPDBR4/5
[13:46:35] <digitok> ChrisM, adjust it in settings
[13:46:48] <karhunkynsii> ChrisM, uniq, https://regex101.com/r/mtY8E0/5
[13:47:16] <karhunkynsii> Set all to 50%, removed the 100 thing,  sort | uniq
[13:47:59] <digitok> re101-zorse-31 i don't get it
[13:48:03] <digitok> remove everything else?
[13:48:06] <karhunkynsii> Took it down from 3583 lines to 405.
[13:48:55] <re101-zorse-31> digitok no, I want to make it so that when you substitute the result, the end result will remove everything asides from what I wanted captured and will show it like this: "full_name":"karl morgan","linkedin_url":"linkedin.com/in/karl-morgan-60765316" and so on
[13:49:03] <ChrisM> Thanks
[13:49:27] <digitok> isn't that what i said
[13:49:29] <ChrisM> But now what do I do since I have too much to paste into regex101 
[13:49:43] <re101-zorse-31> oh then yes 
[13:49:53] <digitok> where are you using this?
[13:49:57] <re101-zorse-31> emeditor
[13:49:59] <ChrisM> Digitok said something about adjusting the settings, in regex101?
[13:50:06] <karhunkynsii> ChrisM, for testing now, or for actual use?
[13:50:11] <re101-zorse-31> testing
[13:50:17] <re101-zorse-31> oh sorry ^
[13:50:25] <digitok> lol
[13:50:50] <digitok> re101-zorse-31, the data never contains newlines righ
[13:50:52] <digitok> right*
[13:50:55] <ChrisM> To actually run the subtitution on all the code I need to
[13:51:07] <re101-zorse-31> yea it does not digitok
[13:51:19] <digitok> and if a value is null, do you want it?
[13:51:34] <re101-zorse-31> yes 
[13:51:37] <digitok> ok
[13:51:39] <digitok> gimme a sec
[13:51:55] <karhunkynsii> ChrisM, don't you have other programs you can use?
[13:52:13] <digitok> just adjust the setting
[13:52:22] <digitok> settings > max execution time
[13:52:49] <ChrisM> I have SublimeText and VSCode but neither of them let me run a regex search on one regex string and then run a substition with a tottally differnt regex string
[13:53:25] <ChrisM> What do you use?
[13:53:58] <karhunkynsii> ChrisM, you can use something like https://regex101.com/r/w4e3gI/6 first on the file.
[13:54:51] <karhunkynsii> Then use the other substitution on the result.
