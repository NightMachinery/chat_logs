[04:29:32] <dpkg> When a <testing> release becomes frozen, <unstable> tends to partially freeze as well.  This is because developers are reluctant to upload radically new software to unstable, in case the frozen software in testing needs minor updates and to fix release critical bugs which keep testing from becoming <stable>.

[06:15:54] <sney> php7.3-fpm.service on my system specifies /run/php without /var, yeah 
[06:16:12] <Casper26> yea
[06:16:30] <PMT> It doesn't functionally matter, here, I'm just mentioning you don't have to go to /var/run while I tinker with my VM.

[13:40:54] <dpkg> Now Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is July 31st 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. Stuff may slip but July 31 is hoped for.
[13:41:21] <Mathisen> thanks for that
[13:41:30] <Mathisen> July 17th that what i was looking for

[13:54:35] <jelly> then, even cheaper
[13:54:39] <TheBigK> :D
[13:55:44] <TheBigK> i was ovh customer for many years and i still am with my domains... i cant complain. assuming i would have been affected... i would have been online within 48 hours i believe... thats a fantastic job considering how big of a scale fire they had
[13:56:52] <TheBigK> i would even go so far to recommend others ovh... 
[13:57:50] <ratrace> I'm a customer of OVH for years now too. we keep redundant capacities between OVH and Hetzner. I migrated a few servers from SBG to FRA just weeks before the fire. but even if I didn't, I'd just DNS failover to Hetzner. *shrug*  . I was very surprised to see all the tears on twitter; people don't do proper offsite backups.
[13:58:55] <TheBigK> the question i have for myself... may be u know more than me... they offer backup ftp storage... imagine u have a server and also ordered ftp backup and that backup is gone with the fire too? was that the case for some?

[14:00:08] <ratrace> yes, I think some of "we have backups!" were burned, literally, becuse their backups are onsite.

[14:02:11] <TheBigK> the question is now... were the ftp storage servers on a different fire area... because i read that there was more than one area affected... if the design was correct in terms of ftp backup... then the question is who did the design mistake in the building... probably ovh since the design was also ordered by ovh

[14:04:02] <ratrace> I learned not to trust that back in 2012 when Linode's "backups" turned out to be massively corrupt and couldn't use them when you needed them.
[14:04:03] <TheBigK> thats kinda scary that those hosters dont use a different fire area for their backup services...

[15:45:01] <TheBigK> locsmif: what do u mean... timeshift
[15:45:48] <TheBigK> i know systemd.timers can be configured that its run daily... and really only daily... even in a timeshift i would assume its not run more than once a day or whatever period u wanna take
[15:46:44] <TheBigK> bot for cron u need to bring that logic into the job itself
[15:47:04] <taman> locsmif: check a file touched by the last successful run. If its time is much different from expected, stop with error.
[15:47:20] <TheBigK> taman: thats what i meant with bring that logic in the job
[15:48:08] <TheBigK> i run my backup over systemd.timers... since my workstation doesnt run daily to a specific time... so i did the setup to a random time at boot time... 
[15:48:29] <TheBigK> i like a lot of the features systemd bring to the table... 
[15:48:50] <TheBigK> and i dont miss writing init scripts for simple tasks ;D
[15:48:52] <ratrace> a similar issue I had was using hour in (zfs) snap names. so when the time rolled back every autumn, I'd have the 2am snap re-try teh already existing 2am snap (becasue 3am would become 2am again)
[15:49:13] <ratrace> but taht's just illusion of the poorly chosen namespace. in reality, it really is a hour _later_ snapshot
[15:50:39] <locsmif> summer time and the reverse are properly covered in the internal vixie cron logic, but I'm talking about restoring a snapshot, which should result in a system clock several days behind the current date/time, but somehow this triggers daily jobs to be run at once, outside of their slotted time. Some jobs, fine, but some I only want to run at their actually alotted time slot, e.g. 6 AM
[15:51:54] <ratrace> wait what kind of snapshot stores system clock? something something frozen VM on the hypervisor side?
[15:52:18] <locsmif> I save mem with the snapshot, this is proxmox with qemu
[15:53:09] <hassoon> anyone made sure that pm-powersave true does reduce power consumption for laptops ? not sure if it made a difference yet, i'm monitoring the battery usage in i3wm
[15:53:10] <ratrace> right, so frozen VM state. your VMs should really use the virtio-lock
[15:53:12] <ratrace> *clock
[15:53:54] <locsmif> ratrace: how do I do that?
[15:54:07] <locsmif> Is this is qemu/proxmox setting?
[15:54:31] <ratrace> the guest kernel should be built with CONFIG_PARAVIRT_CLOCK=y, which debian is.
[15:55:19] <ratrace> but eh yes, it's possible proxmox changes something there. proxmox != debian tho
[15:55:34] *** Joins: abrotman (~abrotman@user/abrotman)
[15:56:27] <locsmif> ratrace: I came here because of the explicit references to Debian extensions in the cron man page
[15:57:07] <locsmif> I expected to learn how to adjust cron to not immediately run some tasks or a way how to configure that, but this may indeed be a better solution
[15:57:10] <ratrace> I think cron is a red herring here. also:
[15:57:12] <ratrace> !based on debian
[15:57:12] <dpkg> Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.

[15:58:00] *** Joins: ftobich (~ftobich@debian/ftobich)
[15:58:07] <at0m> locsmif: maybe anacron can help where cron falls short for you
[15:58:45] <ratrace> the actual solution here is to not have such large (UTC) time changes. check the proxmox docs or something to see if the snapshot can be made with paravirt clock in mind so when you thaw it, it uses the hypervisor'd time
[15:59:58] <ratrace> anacron would be worse, it'd notice that large amount of time has passed and it'd trigger events thinking they're way past due
[16:00:21] <ratrace> in fact, anacron is specifically designed to trigger events due to time not running continuously, so it re-runs what was supposedly missed

[16:05:24] <PMT> I don't think you can.
[16:05:39] <ratrace> locsmif: but re-reading all you wrote ... are you actually sure you're not already using anacron? cron shouldn't trigger on missed time. I don't think I've ever seen it do that

[16:16:35] <ratrace> that's already how some packaged cronojobs ensure, for example, they're run on _first_ sunday in the month
[16:17:06] <locsmif> Aha
[16:17:18] <locsmif> I never bothered to look into very closely
[16:18:19] <locsmif> Hmm.. honestly instinctively you'd expect it to be tweakable, but perhaps, as usual, there are valid and time-tested system administration reasons not to

[16:20:36] <ratrace> then again I'm reading through the find_jobs() function and maybe I was wrong. the schedule is to _check_ all the jobs, but find_jobs _still_ does minute comparisons
[16:24:42] <locsmif> Those Debug msgs, hmm, interesting if they were logged by default
[16:28:00] *** Joins: thekingofbandit (thekingofb@user/thekingofbandit)
[16:28:09] <ratrace> yeah, see what it does. wakeup case 1, it loops through virtual minutes, re-testing for jobs until current time is reached. case 2 the same but ignores wildcard entries, 0 doesn't ignore them and "default" is large time change (> 3 minutes) where it just updates current time and retests all the jobs but still each test does a check against current time
[16:30:09] <ratrace> so looking at this I would _not_ expect it to run any job, if time diff is > 3 minutes     and whatever wallclock time was taken does not exactly correspond to scheduled time.    unless I'm missing something in admittedly barely readable double-looped megatest.

[18:27:09] <Alexthek1d> because i have to switch to legacy for using docker

[18:36:14] <PMT> Docker seems to have reverted their glue that explicitly called iptables-legacy bits for Debian in favor of just calling iptables back in 2019. I see instructions for using nftables, but they seem to just be to avoid using the iptables compat layer.
[18:37:05] <PMT> So do w/e you want, but it seems like the expectation was that iptables-nft would do the right thing.

[18:41:53] <ratrace> why would docker care about the iptables backend? either it used iptables (api, syntax) or nft. 
[18:43:12] <PMT> It used to explicitly call iptables-legacy bits, I presume either just out of fear or because they found shortcomings in the backward compat.

[20:12:15] <BCMM> nixpipe: if you were to try and package it, the work already done for the Ubuntu PPA might (or might not) be a useful starting point https://github.com/ernstp/ppa-mesarc/tree/master/corectrl/debian

[20:13:43] <dpkg> The packaging tutorial (https://deb.li/QYyI) and the New Maintainer's Guide (https://deb.li/3DiDA) are good places to start learning about Debian packaging.  You should also ask me about <devref> and <policy> to understand how packages should be maintained and how they should interact with each other.  Ask me about <package basics>, <mentors>, <best practices> <build without helper>.  https://www.debian.org/devel/

[20:14:54] <sney> there is a learning curve for the debian packaging tools, they aren't really like anything else, but if you're reasonably technical you can get it. bonus if you already understand git.
