German agents discovered in Mexico City were planning the attack in order to paralyze the

[02:26:58] <feepbot> The Truth About Cast Iron Pans: 7 Myths That Need To Go Away (Are cast iron skillets nonstick? Can you wash cast iron with soap? And more quandaries, explained.)
[02:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Myth #6: "Modern cast iron is just as good as old cast iron. It's all the same material, after all."
[02:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Theory: Metal is metal, cast iron is cast iron, the new stuff is no different than the old Wagner and Griswold pans from early 20th century that people fetishize.
[02:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Reality: The material may be the same, but the production methods have changed. In the old days, cast iron pans were produced by casting in sand-based molds, then polishing the resulting pebbly surfaces until smooth. Vintage cast iron tends to have a satiny smooth finish. By the 1950s, as production scaled up and was streamlined, this final polishing step was dropped from the process. The result? Modern cast iron retains
[02:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  that bumpy, pebbly surface.
[02:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The difference is more minor than you may think. So long as you've seasoned your pan properly, both vintage and modern cast iron should take on a nice non-stick surface, but your modern cast iron will never be quite as non-stick as the vintage stuff."
[02:27:28] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: because "how do I store it without getting the coating on other things, or other things in the coating" is one of the major blockers to me getting a cast-iron pan. All of my non-Teflon pans are stored in a cupboard, upside-down, stacked on top of each other.
[02:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just, a straight up admission that a modern version of a very common consumer product is simply not as good as the one from 70 years ago (!!) and never will be

[08:36:50] <PapuaHardyNet> people who write about their tulpas as if they are different people inside their head is hilarious
[08:37:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm obviously not going to post links here for people to sneer at, but I'm going to simply sneer, since it is bad form to collectively sneer, but okay to privately sneer
[08:38:06] <PapuaHardyNet> re tulpas: hiveminded's tulpamancy posts are probably the most clear explanations and the best mental models I know of for tulpamancy
[08:38:41] <PapuaHardyNet> tulpamancy is LARPing. LARPing privately is acceptable. Asking people to LARP with you is not
[08:39:35] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. although asking friends to LARP with you is acceptable
[08:39:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder whether what counts as a LARP and what doesn't is up to social norms
[08:43:24] <catern> this seems like a fairly subtle definition of LARP
[08:43:49] <catern> which seems kind of divorced from "live action roleplaying"?
[08:44:15] <PapuaHardyNet> of course, the definition of LARPing has changed a lot from the literal definition
[08:44:35] <PapuaHardyNet> although you could always map it simply to "roleplaying"
[08:45:21] <catern> well, I hear people say "LARPing" about, like, people who claim to be violent revolutionaries
[08:45:50] <catern> there it makes sense
[08:46:42] <catern> from its original definition - like, you might make a foam gun and go pretend you're in 1917 Russia in a park as a LARP

[11:22:55] <nshepperd2> it's not really actionable information

[11:26:12] <PlanckWalk> Why would you abstain from cryonics?
[11:26:25] <kuudes> because your brain will be destroyed before you die
[11:27:01] <PlanckWalk> It might... or might not
[11:27:31] <nshepperd2> you might still be hit by a truck before you reach that age
[11:28:13] <PlanckWalk> If you've got double-4, then there's still a pretty godo chance that you never develop Alzheimer's
[11:28:33] <nshepperd2> that too
[11:28:48] <PlanckWalk> If you think cryonics is borderline worth it, that might be enough to tip the balance against
[11:28:57] <PlanckWalk> Otherwise it shouldn't.
[11:28:59] <nshepperd2> also there's the "find a friendly jurisdiction, do preemptive cryonics option"
[11:31:34] <kuudes> if you are double-4, it seems, eh, very high probability that you will get AD
[11:32:10] <kuudes> "At least one third of patients with AD are APOE4 negative and some APOE4 homozygotes never develop the disease. Yet those with two ε4 alleles have up to 20 times the risk of developing AD.[67] There is also evidence that the APOE2 allele may serve a protective role in AD.[68] Thus, the genotype most at risk for Alzheimer's disease and at an earlier age is APOE4,4. Using genotype APOE3,3 as a benchmark (with the persons who have this genotype regarded
[11:32:10] <kuudes>  as having a risk level of 1.0), individuals with genotype APOE4,4 have an odds ratio of 14.9 of developing Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with the APOE3,4 genotype face an odds ratio of 3.2, and people with a copy of the 2 allele and the 4 allele (APOE2,4), have an odds ratio of 2.6. Persons with one copy each of the 2 allele and the 3 allele (APOE2,3) have an odds ratio of 0.6. Persons with two copies of the 2 allele (APOE2,2) also have an odds ratio 
[11:32:11] <kuudes> of 0.6."

[12:06:15] <feep[work]> quanticle: iiam
[12:06:45] <quanticle> Well, my criticism at this point has nothing to do with his ideas. It has far more to do with the fact that he was appointed to the position he wanted by Boris Johnson... and then proceeded to fail so spectacularly that he got fired.
[12:07:54] <saturn2> that's really not a very good criticism
[12:08:20] <quanticle> No, it is, because quite a lot of what Cummings talks about is about implementation, and being "effective"

[12:10:55] <kuudes> he should have been better at political knife fights
[12:11:27] <mst> kuudes: he was up against 20+ year whitehall veterans
[12:11:32] <saturn2> steve bannon got pushed out as soon as SNL started making fun of trump for listening to him, lol
[12:11:45] <mst> damnit, I don't particularly like him, and I'm not sure whether he was actually capable of being effective

[12:12:08] <kuudes> he talks too openly to be effective
[12:12:31] <kuudes> one has to take eggs in the face with smile unless they actually mean something

[12:16:29] <quanticle> Yeah. So he didn't really have a department to reform. Maybe he would have been better off if Boris Johnson had actually given him a ministry to reform, but that would have meant depriving an actual elected MP of the power of a cabinet position, and I'm not sure that Boris Johnson was ever going to do that.

[12:19:06] <kuudes> but after brexit he made posts how fellow brexiteer vips are idiots

[15:44:33] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: I think the frst part is correct; as the Fed (through primary dealer commercial banks) purchases Treasuries (almost) directly they reduce the supply of such debt and drive up their worth (hence lowering the effective yield paid). But this doesn't make people more favourably loan money to the government. The government (Treasury) still wants to issue more debt regardless of what The People 
[15:44:39] <otoburb> want. 
[15:46:27] <otoburb> Also, the Fed bought the Treasuries with de novo electronic bank reserves that they transferred to commercial banks. 
[15:47:42] <otoburb> Unless the US commercial banks like BofA or JP Morgan can encourage more people to take out loans (mortgages, auto loans, business loans), then those bank reserves (commonly referred to as money printed out of thin air) never really make it into the economy to circulate.
[15:48:49] <otoburb> ... which is why Treasury then switched to fiscal policy (i.e. send checks directly to the population), rather than trying to stimulate the economy through monetary policy (create more bank reserves)
[15:49:38] <Gurkenglas> "The government (Treasury) still wants to issue more debt regardless of what The People want." <- I don't follow. Say the government can sell one 2030-$ today for 50c. Its worth today is determined by inflation and the probability of the government defaulting. The Fed injects money by buying goverment-2030-$ on the open market. Now the price is 70ct, and the government can get 70ct for each 2030-$. Right?
[15:51:50] <Gurkenglas> (And its worth today might also have been determined by the probability that the Fed would inject money this way.)

[15:59:40] <otoburb> And yes, the worth today is supposedly determined by free market participants (minus the big Fed elephant distorting the supply side) who supposedly try to take inflation into account

Banks, Other Than Reserve Balances: U.S. Treasury, General Account [snip])
[16:08:28] <otoburb> One (big) reason the government desperately needs to raise the debt ceiling (formality as it is) is because the government is so indebted that it can't possibly pay off all the short-term debt that comes due, hence the Treasury needs to keep issuing more debt
[16:09:15] <otoburb> Normally this is fine (I understand the term "debt rollover" is used for this scenario) when you have great credit and willing buyers of your debt.
[16:10:12] <otoburb> But without room to issue more debt, Treasury will need to figure out whether to cut down on the following expenditures: 1) Debt; 2) SS; 3) Medicare; 4) Operating budget (i.e. federal employees). I tihnk there's a 5th but I forget
[16:10:50] <otoburb> Oh right -- yeah #5 = Defense Spending (technically part of #4 but some people like to differentiate between civilian expenditures vs. national defense)
[16:11:55] <otoburb> It's hard to believe that the mighty US of A would allow anything to happen to any of the above, except #4. In the past, I think we recently saw that exact scenario play out where federal employees were furloughed. 
[16:11:56] <Gurkenglas> Debt rollover leads to an exponential growth until inflation is determined entirely by the interest rate, right?
[16:13:19] <otoburb> If you keep rolling over all debt without corresponding increases in revenue (i.e. taxes & trade surpluses) to offset, then that's bad all around. 
[16:13:47] <otoburb> Inflation, depending on the economic school of thought one belongs in, usually refers to the simplistic definition of a rise in the prices of goods and services over time. 
[16:14:29] <otoburb> Inflation is sometimes not determined by the interest rate, but the interest rate (and there are various interst rates that people take note of) plays a big role.  
[16:15:17] <otoburb> Inflation is great if you have debts; you can pay them back over time with gradually more worthless fiat. 
[16:15:57] <Gurkenglas> wait whats the difference between "i promise that if i cant pay back my debt ill borrow more" and a pyramid scheme
[16:15:58] <otoburb> But if your debt load is so big that a slight rise in interest rates would cause your debt servicing to be untenable, then you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

[16:17:00] <otoburb> Most pyramid schemes don't generate goods & services. They rely on suckers to keep putting in money to keep the scheme going. If you squint hard enough, then most things look like a pyramid scheme.

[16:22:17] <otoburb> You know what's really cool to see (not) is the % of US GDP that the government spends. Imperfect measure, but eye opening: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=8fX
[16:22:28] <feepbot> Government Current Expenditures/Gross Domestic Product | FRED | St. Louis Fed (Graph and download economic data for  from Q1 1947 to Q2 2021 about expenditures, government, GDP, and USA.)
[16:25:32] <Gurkenglas> assume no ceiling, what happens. some expect the government to default?? and so the interest rate is above inflation. the debt grows to 50% of the money supply. the fed notices US is overshooting the growth target and sells some treasuries and mortgages. That makes the debt situation worse and also it's harder to get a mortgage
[16:26:31] <kuudes> at least in eu ecb does not plan to sell any of those debts it has purchased but instead keeps them up to term
[16:28:27] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, there is always 0 money in the world. every unit of money is promise from someone else, their debt
[16:28:33] <otoburb> Assume no ceiling. Government will likely cut expenditures so as not to default on any debt. If they default on debt, US debt will need to command higher interest rates across the yield curve (meaning, across all debt terms from 90 days up to 30 years) to attract more buyers
[16:28:44] <feep[work]> kuudes: that's ... not a necessary property of money
[16:28:45] <kuudes> the euro notes in your wallet are promises of ecb to pay you 10 euros
[16:28:49] <kuudes> yes it is
[16:28:54] <feep[work]> no, consider a gold standard
[16:28:59] <feep[work]> would you say "there is no gold in the world"?
[16:29:04] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, why will it cut on expenditures when there is no ceiling? no ceiling means to the moon
[16:29:05] <kuudes> gold is not money
[16:29:14] <feep[work]> okay hang on, are you asserting that gold *cannot* be money?
[16:29:25] <feep[work]> this seems like a very restrictive definition of money.
[16:29:34] <otoburb> If the interest rates (esp. 10yr, 20yr and 30yr) start to rise, then the domestic effect knockon effects are: 1) higher debt servicing costs for goernment (bad spiral), 2) domestic US home purchasers will see higher mortgage rates
[16:30:15] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: Sorry I misunderstand. I thought "no ceiling" meant the ceiling isn't extended. IF you mean blue sky, then we have the same situation continuing. Rickety brittle stability.
[16:30:36] <kuudes> feep[work], silver dollar is the promise that the piece of silver it is printed on is worth 1 dollar
[16:30:49] <feep[work]> but silver exists, yes?
[16:31:03] <feep[work]> so it sounds like you are saying, "there are euros, but there are no euros"
[16:31:16] <kuudes> silver is not dollars
[16:31:23] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, doesn't rickety brittle stability mean that some people will expect a crash, and therefore the interest rate is slightly above inflation?
[16:31:35] <otoburb> Nobody will expect the government to default, but then there's the issue of whether the government is devaluing the US dollar. And yes, then there's a real possibility of inflation rising due to (possibly) more currency units chasing the same level of goods & services. 
[16:31:46] <feep[work]> so you are asserting that "silver cannot be money"?
[16:31:52] <kuudes> dollar has the value of the goods someone will give you for it. each transaction defines its value
[16:32:04] <feep[work]> that seems to hold for everything
[16:32:08] <kuudes> well, yes
[16:32:55] <kuudes> which is why silver dollar draws its value expectation originally from the barter value of silver
[16:32:58] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: Which interest rate are you referring to? There are a bunch of them. At the moment, a bunch of people like focusing on the 10yr (which is at around 1.5%) as a bell weather. Inflation (Fed says it's transitory) is running around 4-6% annualized. 
[16:33:13] <kuudes> and often names of monetary units are past weight measure units
[16:33:29] <kuudes> like markka is a weight measure unit iirc
[16:33:34] <feep[work]> right so again, it seems like you are saying "euros don't exist, only euros exist"
[16:33:36] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, i mean the interest rate induced by the price at which treasury auctions are won
[16:33:50] <kuudes> what is your confusion?

[16:34:35] <feep[work]> kuudes: I think you overvalue the notion of debt as a necessary property of money rather than a clever hack, and I'm trying to demonstrate this.
[16:34:58] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: Yes, if people lose faith in the value of the USD (usually proxied by the $DXY, which is measured against a basket of currencies but majority the EUR), then our debt will need to command higher and higher interest rates and make it all ruinous, thus accelerating a debt default because the US can't pay.

[16:36:32] <kuudes> thanks
[16:36:49] <kuudes> feep[work], feel free to demonstrate then
[16:37:27] <feep[work]> I er, consider it demonstrated via "here is a piece of silver. this works as currency."
[16:37:30] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, when does the unlimited rollover first start to devalue the dollar?
[16:37:38] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: Nobody knows. 
[16:38:04] <otoburb> It's further complicated by the fact that the USD is the reserve currency of the world; the whole petrodollar contraption aka the eurodollar ecosystem. 
[16:38:04] <kuudes> https://www.treasurydirect.gov/ does not seem to respond to me for some reason
[16:38:07] <feep[work]> here is a silver coin. here is another silver coin. it follows that currency exists.
[16:38:16] <kuudes> yes, currency exists.
[16:38:39] <feep[work]> the net amount of silver in existence is nonzero :p
[16:38:47] <kuudes> yes, but the silver is not the currency
[16:38:52] <feep[work]> I think it is.
[16:38:55] <Gurkenglas> otoburb, nobody knows because of the anti-inductive nature of the market? then assume that all market participants have simple strategies so you can model them
[16:39:01] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: Because Saudi Arabia and other countries price their oil in USD (for the most part - -some countries are already breaking away from this), there is literally a global demand for USD that matches (I think recently exceeds) domestic demand for USD. 
[16:39:15] <kuudes> if I have 1 kg of silver, and we agree I give you 123 g of it and you give me some amount of bread
[16:39:22] <kuudes> no monetary transaction happened, it was barter
[16:39:40] <kuudes> you just have 123 g of silver after that
[16:39:53] <feep[work]> I think this is a monetary transaction.
[16:40:00] <kuudes> it is not
[16:40:10] <kuudes> what is the money in there?
[16:40:15] <feep[work]> the piece of silver
[16:40:24] <feep[work]> it is money because there is a social convention that trade is carried out in silver
[16:40:25] <kuudes> no, it is a good
[16:40:33] <feep[work]> currency is socially constructed~
[16:40:36] <kuudes> yes
[16:40:46] <feep[work]> but it's still physically real.
[16:40:46] <Gurkenglas> or abstractly, assume that market participants use one oracle to (imperfectly) predict each other, and you use an oracle that's powerful enough to predict them - what self-referential query might you use to find out when the brittle stability collapses?
[16:40:46] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: I think economists and financial soothsayers have tried, and are continuing to try, to use such models. Maybe somebody knows, but it sure seems pretty murky.
[16:41:02] <feep[work]> the net amount of silver vs silver obligations is still nonzero.
[16:41:19] <kuudes> the amount of silver obligations is always zero
[16:41:24] <feep[work]> uh, no
[16:41:26] <kuudes> they indeed are currency
[16:41:35] <feep[work]> I promise to give you some silver at a later time
[16:41:44] <feep[work]> I give you a promissory note for 150g silver
[16:41:46] <otoburb> Gurkenglas: You know the old adage: Markets can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent (Keynes I believe)
[16:41:49] <kuudes> yes, now you have debt in silver, I have similar amount of gain
[16:41:49] <feep[work]> silver *still* exists.
[16:41:59] <kuudes> yes, but the promise of silver is different from silver
[16:42:00] <feep[work]> right, but the sum is not zero and it still works as a currency.
[16:42:07] <kuudes> silver is not promise of silver
[16:42:18] <feep[work]> yes, but euros also exist and euros are also not promise of euros
[16:42:24] <kuudes> euros are promise of euros
[16:42:30] <feep[work]> if we are to say "the net amount of euros is zero" this obviously cannot be literally true because like
[16:42:35] <feep[work]> kuudes I have physical euros in my jacket right now
[16:42:35] <kuudes> that is what the signature ascertains you of
[16:42:38] <feep[work]> you cannot gaslight me like this
[16:42:41] <feep[work]> I can pull them out rn
[16:42:48] <kuudes> yes, they are debt instruments for you from ecb
[16:42:57] <feep[work]> no they are physically real objects
[16:43:01] <kuudes> the ecb promises it owes you 10 euros
[16:43:12] <feep[work]> no I have them, they are not owed me
[16:43:16] <kuudes> they are
[16:43:18] <feep[work]> they are in my immediate possession.
[16:43:35] <feep[work]> what are you imagining here, that I go to the ecb and exchange my coins for different coins
[16:43:44] <feep[work]> this is nonsense
[16:43:45] <kuudes> hmm, what was the definition of legal tender. promise that all taxes can be paid with it?
[16:43:58] <kuudes> that is the final thing that makes them promise
[16:44:12] <feep[work]> right but that still has nothing to do with the net sum of euros vs euro obligations being zero
[16:44:16] <kuudes> ecb and the government promise you that you can use that 10 euro bill to pay taxes worth of 10 euros
[16:44:28] <feep[work]> yes but that still has nothing to do with net zero.
[16:44:39] <kuudes> government has the power to create debt for you in euros by taxation
[16:44:49] <kuudes> government can say "feep owes us 10 euros"
[16:44:56] <kuudes> and then you will have to pay it or face violence
[16:44:57] <feep[work]> yes
[16:45:02] <kuudes> yes, and that is debt
[16:45:06] <feep[work]> again, I agree with this in the case of euros
[16:45:23] <feep[work]> it is a very elegant system where you perpetually roll debt forward to create a system where currency and currency obligations globally sum to zero
[16:45:33] <feep[work]> it is very pretty, but it has *nothing* to do with euros being a currency.
[16:45:37] <kuudes> they are zero at the start and at all points
[16:45:45] <kuudes> there is no such thing as actual platonic euro
[16:45:58] <kuudes> the euro bill you have is a promise that ecb pays euro amount debt
[16:46:07] <feep[work]> right, and my point is that you can just as much create an obligation that I have to give the state silver
[16:46:11] <kuudes> so you can give it to government which will then erase your tax debt
[16:46:23] <feep[work]> and then I need to either go into silver debt
[16:46:25] <feep[work]> or mine silver
[16:46:26] <kuudes> yes, and that silver obligation is indeed money
[16:46:32] <feep[work]> right but the sum is not zero
[16:46:42] <kuudes> yes, but the silver you give to government is not money
[16:46:50] <feep[work]> because I can create silver ex nihilo with a pickaxe
[16:46:53] <kuudes> only the promise or obligation is money
[16:46:54] <feep[work]> it quacks and walks like money
[16:47:05] <feep[work]> a silver coin and an euro coin have the exact same affordances.

[16:50:28] <Gurkenglas> money market funds sounds like somebody expects them to be a lucrative investment. banks sound like someone who wants to look serious. foreign entities sounds like someone who wants to have the option to sell lots of treasuries right before they declare war on the US so they'll have a harder time borrowing money.

[16:52:06] <kuudes> if it was, then it usually would be much closer to 0 than current
[16:52:13] <kuudes> basicly the governments mostly owe to themselves

[16:53:26] <kuudes> clearly copper usage value on each of the coins must be much less than the coins nominal value
[16:53:49] <kuudes> otherwise indeed one can just go to a bank and exchange money into small coins, melt them and sell them for profit and repeat
[16:54:20] <kuudes> is us treasury interest rate negative currently btw?

[17:02:08] <kuudes> you started it
[17:02:08] <Gurkenglas> and then eu says "huh we did not think you were about to brexit"? :P
[17:02:10] <feep[work]> I kinda did
[17:02:15] <otoburb> Don't almost all countries recognize Monaco, unlike Taiwan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Monaco
[17:02:24] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: it kinda did, yeah, they twisted themselves until technically they weren't poking the issue anymore
[17:02:27] <feepbot> The Principality of Monaco is a sovereign and independent state, linked closely to France by the Treaty of July 1918, which was formally noted in Article 436 of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919.
[17:02:44] <feep[work]> nobody in the eu wants to prompt a german constitutional crisis where the question is "EU membership or the constitution"
[17:02:48] <kuudes> iirc germany sort of relented and twisted it back
[17:02:53] <feep[work]> because like, if one thing could cause a gerexit
[17:02:57] <kuudes> no
[17:03:12] <kuudes> but the german state chose to interpret the constitutional ruling to say that everything is allright
[17:03:18] <feep[work]> kuudes: the constitution and court is genuinely one of the most respected german institutions
[17:03:39] <nshepperd2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730095596861521970/895301094425645096/PXL_20211006_132611616.jpg i baked banana bread
[17:03:41] <kuudes> yes, and everyone agrees they have agreed that germany is a legal state and member to eu and euro and everything is allright
[17:03:54] <feep[work]> yeah everybody is basically doing their best to avoid the issue XD
[17:04:24] <feep[work]> to be fair the ruling was a pretty brutal pimp slap, like, in a "damning with faint expectations" way
[17:04:27] <kuudes> no no the second senate was absolutely correct in their judgement and so was the eu court and commission and the german federal republic and everyone
[17:04:32] <feep[work]> "literally do your job, german parliament, and we will have no issue"
[17:04:34] <kuudes> everyone is correct, everyone gets prize
[17:04:45] <kuudes> yes yes, and parliament did its job
[17:04:50] <feep[work]> parliament agrees, yes
[17:05:04] <kuudes> yes yes, everything is in agreement, yes
[17:05:05] <feep[work]> and constitutional court grumbled faintly and mostly let things rest
[17:05:07] <kuudes> :D

[17:05:47] <feep[work]> wasn't that the disease in prototype
[17:06:25] <kuudes> yeah. and they said if the government does not demonstrate that everything is all right, then the government is illegal
[17:06:34] <feep[work]> which they have the right to say, yeah
[17:06:39] <kuudes> but now the government is legal so the government must have demonstrated everything is all right
[17:06:42] <feep[work]> ^^
[17:07:25] <feep[work]> technically, in an extreme case, if the constitutional court said a thing and the government ignored it, terrorism would become legal in germany.
[17:07:32] <nshepperd2> oh no, you have the bundesverfassungsgericht ecb ultra virus... you have been assimilated
[17:07:51] <feep[work]> as per article 20 para 4, right to resistance in defence of the constitution
[17:08:04] <kuudes> indeed. and clearly as they have not, then the government has not ignored it

[17:09:05] <feep[work]> well, it's not really a judgment in primary purpose, it's more a newspaper bap on the nose
[17:09:08] <PapuaHardyNet> we should all play werewolf
[17:09:47] <kuudes> I have to say, I feel it nice if we finally have positive inflation enough that interest rates could be raised back above 0
[17:09:49] <feep[work]> and, to me, a welcome reminder that the eu can say what it wants, it is *not* the european government.
[17:09:57] <kuudes> it would be nice to be back out of mirror world
[17:10:06] <Gurkenglas> is it allowed to seek to abolish the constitution by means of getting 80% of the vote?
[17:10:10] <kuudes> eu only has the powers the member states have delegated to it
[17:10:18] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yes-iffffffy, but really nope
[17:10:29] <kuudes> indeed, yes but no
[17:10:42] <feep[work]> there's a single escape clause which is the populace can decide a proper constitution, but that'd effectively amount to dissolving and recreating uh

[17:13:07] <feepbot> Euro area yield curves (The relationship between market remuneration rates and the remaining time to maturity of debt securities published by the ECB.)
[17:13:14] <kuudes> euro area bonds are negative at least until t+ 8 years
[17:13:27] <catern> werewolf is larp, you were larping last night when I went to bed and you're still larping now :P
[17:13:40] <kuudes> so if an euro government issues debt of 100 and you buy it for less than 8 years, it will pay you back less than 100 at the end
[17:13:47] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, so uhh the only ones that would buy them are those that are not in it for the gains?
[17:13:52] <kuudes> yes
[17:14:14] <kuudes> there are plenty of things that have some sort of weird rules that they must buy government bonds
[17:14:19] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: well, I did have a day of meetings and work sooo
[17:14:47] <PapuaHardyNet> also I have no idea what I was larping about 8 hours ago, but it doesn't matter I guess
[17:14:53] <Gurkenglas> and they... had no plan for when the government is debt free?
[17:15:11] <kuudes> one of them is the london special purpose instrument owned by greek banks which holds euro AAA bonds nominally worth the amount finland loaned to greece back then
[17:15:26] <kuudes> and as AAA bond rates are negative, those papers lose value constantly
[17:15:39] <Gurkenglas> do they have to keep buying more to go back to the nominal worth required?
[17:15:39] <kuudes> at about the pace finland loses money by lending it to greece
[17:15:50] <kuudes> yes

[17:16:51] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: wat happen
[17:16:54] <PapuaHardyNet> holy shit, catern won
[17:16:59] <catern> :)
[17:17:10] <PapuaHardyNet> looks like a game isn't fun without at least 8 players
[17:17:19] <Gurkenglas> uhhh. wasn't there supposed to be chat at some point
[17:17:34] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah but this was the first night, and you killed catern and catern killed you
[17:17:35] <catern> i'm just that good

[17:24:45] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], article 79 does seem to allow changing the German verfassung with a 2/3 majority; is that clause verfassungsfeindlich? is intending to use it?
[17:26:33] <gwern> Gurkenglas: hm, so you'd detect falling and 'deflate' all of the 'trees' around the person so they are swaddled in the limbs instead of hit?
[17:26:51] <Gurkenglas> gwern, yeah
[17:26:53] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: no that's the single escape clause
[17:27:00] <feep[work]> wait hang on, 79
[17:27:01] * feep[work] thinks
[17:27:18] <feep[work]> oh yeah no that's fine, but it can't affect the eternal clauses
[17:27:27] <Gurkenglas> it can affect itself so uhhh
[17:27:41] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: no it cannot, paragraph 3

[17:28:07] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, congratulations you made it less fun
[17:28:46] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, the fun comes when you start the mind games
[17:29:49] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: okay, obviously this is a hole in the text but the current established judicial opinion is that article 79 covers itself
[17:30:26] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], whence the crisis? about whether changing 79 is illegal because it's done with the intent of doing something illegal? i dont think it's illegal to vote for legalizing marijuana with the intent of smoking it
[17:30:27] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: the actual escape hatch is article 146
[17:30:53] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: right, but article 79 is considered as an immutable protection, and an immutable protection that is itself mutable is absurd
[17:31:00] <feep[work]> this is a rules as written vs intent thing
[17:31:41] <Gurkenglas> okay so there's a clause somewhere that articles are to be interpreted by their intent?

[17:34:33] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: again, this is not something that will ever come up because if the constitutional court needs to actually slap lawmakers around cause they're trying to abolish the protection for uh
[17:34:37] <feep[work]> democracy
[17:34:38] <feep[work]> and like, human rights
[17:34:50] <feep[work]> we're gonna have a civil war on our hands anyways :p
[17:38:46] <feep[work]> the real interesting question is if 146 is covered by 79.
[17:38:50] <kuudes> I had a case in a youth association decades ago where a member wanted us to change the association rules so that association could only be disbanded by 2/3 of vote of 2 different general meetings, but rules themselves could be altered with 1/2 of 1 meeting
[17:38:59] <feep[work]> lol
[17:39:18] <kuudes> multiple people tried to explain him that then the former does not matter. iirc we gave up in the end
[17:39:23] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: well when you get more players, ping me, I like to play this game
[17:39:27] <kuudes> the earlier rule was 1/2 for both

[17:41:11] <feep[work]> see, the interesting thing is, this was actually a case about germany joining the eu
[17:41:28] <kiboneu> but both chatting and games can have second-order benefits to work
[17:41:35] <kuudes> but yeah, iirc as I have understood from feep that basicly the only way to actually change the constitution of germany would be to actually form germany
[17:41:46] <feep[work]> and the court says "okay, if you're gonna use paragraph 146 to recreate germany with a different legal structure, that might conflict with human rights, human dignity etc, we're not saying that's illegal but we're leaving it open."
[17:41:47] <kuudes> as currently germany is instead a beta state country
[17:42:00] <feep[work]> yep
[17:42:06] <kuudes> and there is the expectation to sometime actually release it. but it has been postponed
[17:42:14] <kuudes> and now everyone is just working with the beta
[17:42:15] <feep[work]> well, this was originally intended for reunification
[17:42:20] <feep[work]> but we just kept the structure anyways
[17:42:28] <kuudes> yes, and then reunification happened but laws didn't change
[17:42:30] <kuudes> indeed
[17:42:36] <feep[work]> I don't think people expected the soviet block to collapse as completely as it did
[17:42:57] <feep[work]> people expected both halves of germany to sort of dissolve and reunify maybe, they didn't expect west germany to eat east germany wholesale
[17:43:11] <kuudes> indeed
[17:43:19] <feep[work]> but when a good fraction of your populace is on the streets weekly, your negotiation position is uh, poor. :p
[17:43:52] <kuudes> it is interesting if we could get korean peace treaty out of the china-taiwan escalations
[17:43:57] <feep[work]> so now paragraph 146 is not dead, but resting~

[17:44:52] <kuudes> meh
[17:44:59] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], "leaving it open" as in "depends on the circumstances" or "we are not wise enough for this"?
[17:45:03] <kuudes> whats that thing which technically could institute a constitution for eu?
[17:45:05] <kuudes> convent?
[17:45:13] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: literally "may be left open."
[17:45:28] <Gurkenglas> yeah im asking about their intent because apparently that matters :P
[17:45:29] <feep[work]> as in "we do not need to decide this today, but we wish to note that it is something that we *would* have to decide."
[17:45:31] <kuudes> well, I for one sort of expect germany to just acceed all eu member states
[17:46:22] <kuudes> basicly it is a good day when root powers are not needed
[17:46:35] <kuudes> the legal system in eu operates way too heavily with sudo
[17:46:41] <Gurkenglas> i wonder if im put on some sort of list for reading the german constitution
[17:46:48] <kuudes> :D why
[17:46:58] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: literally, "whether the commitment to democracy and human rights exceeds, due to the universal claim to dignity, freedom and equality, even binds the german populace as the constitutional sovereign, ie. in the 146 case, may be left open."
[17:47:00] <kuudes> read the tax law next, I dare you!
[17:47:07] <feep[work]> -exceeds
[17:47:48] <kuudes> I hope someone some day puts an easter egg inside german law. like "whomever reads this may claim a free lollipop from second senate" or something
[17:47:57] <feep[work]> .note feep in 2h do the hebrew thing
[17:48:00] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, that would be amazing
[17:48:32] <Gurkenglas> i read it and then i asked :P. so the court is supposed to decide based on the intent of the law. is that the intent of the maker of the law, at the time he made it?
[17:48:44] <feep[work]> it's not one thing
[17:48:53] <feep[work]> fundamentally, all judgment is interpretation.
[17:48:57] <feep[work]> like, inherently.
[17:49:08] <kuudes> we wish it was not, but it is
[17:49:18] <feep[work]> the constitutional court will reference a body of earlier work, partially its own, partially legal experts, about the meaning of words
[17:49:30] <feep[work]> where necessary, that is; most terms will have obvious meanings
[17:49:47] <Gurkenglas> there is more than one way to instruct judges on how to interpret laws
[17:49:55] <feep[work]> in effect, they try to use the meaning of the paragraphs, but they are guided in this by more than the specific formulation.
[17:50:08] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: the constitutional court is not "instructed"; they're the ultimate authority.
[17:50:13] <feep[work]> in effect they could make it up if they wanted
[17:50:17] <feep[work]> luckily they're not trolls
[17:51:02] <kuudes> that is the us direct democracy option: senate + president could nominate each american citizen as supreme court justic
[17:51:10] <Gurkenglas> that's also a possible instruction. "be led by your personal incentives"
[17:51:15] <kuudes> then everything would be under direct democracy vote
[17:51:22] <kuudes> no no
[17:51:25] <kuudes> not personal incentives
[17:54:37] <Gurkenglas> personal incentives as in "execute the plan which your neocortex predicts to best satisfy your brainstem", the default. aka: personal greed, thinking highly of themselves, not getting torched in the street for looking evil, etc.

[18:04:17] <feep[work]> there is a ladder of validation, and the constitutional court stands at the bottom of the ladder, holding it.
[18:04:43] <feep[work]> when you say "it would be allowed", the constitutional court is who decides whether it matches the constitution to allow it.
[18:04:57] <feep[work]> plus or minus the resistance paragraph, of course. :p
[18:05:05] <feep[work]> like, ultimately all power flows from the sovereign
[18:05:22] <feep[work]> the actual bottom of the ladder, well, the floor rather, is the populace.
[18:05:49] <feep[work]> but uh, that goes anyways regardless, because see above re socially constructed.
[18:06:14] <feep[work]> (but also, the law explicitly acknowledges this.)
[18:06:38] <feep[work]> but also, challenge along those lines always has an air of "come and try, if you think you got it"

[18:16:03] <feep[work]> every man an island, every island a law :)
[18:16:38] <Gurkenglas> that is, only the countries that already exist count.
[18:16:51] <feep[work]> huh, funky then
[18:17:28] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: wellllll, I think it would still maneuver things so that countries split up
[18:17:47] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: like, german "spirit of the law" is that if, theoretically, every german wanted to declare the square meter around them a separate country, they could do that

[18:18:12] <feep[work]> genuinely, intentionally, the state only has power by collective consent
[18:18:51] <Gurkenglas> There's a difference between what the AI thinks a country is and what the german constitution thinks a country is. the latter is in quotation marks.
[18:19:11] <feep[work]> ooh
[18:19:22] <feep[work]> you mean the ai would not care about future countries
[18:19:25] <Gurkenglas> yes
[18:19:29] <feep[work]> okay
[18:19:37] <feep[work]> well it would still want to destroy germany
[18:19:43] <Gurkenglas> Why?
[18:19:44] <feep[work]> no germany, no chance to break its spirit of the law
[18:20:00] <feep[work]> minimize risk, abolish borders
[18:20:19] <Gurkenglas> It's maximizing the number of countries whose spirit it never, since its construction, breaks, not minimizing the number of countries whose spirit it will break.
[18:20:31] <feep[work]> right, but that number can only go down
[18:20:41] <feep[work]> it's capped by the number of countries existing at activation
[18:20:50] <Gurkenglas> correct. no mandate to destroy germany
[18:20:56] <feep[work]> yes mandate
[18:21:13] <feep[work]> if you abolish germany, germany has no constituency, it's "at rest" and its spirit cannot be broken even in principle
[18:21:26] <feep[work]> this action puts germany in the "safe" column.
[18:21:45] <Gurkenglas> but then you have destroyed its constitution which loses you the Germany-point
[18:21:48] <feep[work]> no because
[18:21:50] <feep[work]> this action is in keeping with the spirit of german law.

[18:34:23] <gwern> 'It's fun to dream about a world where we just add one new technology, and climb anywhere safely. What we've learned from industry, though, is that this isn't the way to achieve safety at heights. We know what works. It's training and certification, standard procedures, oversight and buddy checks, and mechanical redundancy -the opposite of hitting the gym for an afternoon on your own with...
[18:34:29] <gwern> ...some sci-fi gear. This is the same reason that airplanes are the safest mode of transportation, yet personal flying cars don't exist.' -_-
[18:34:39] <PapuaHardyNet> good morning to you too, gwern
[18:35:12] <Gurkenglas> VR gear. checkmate.
[18:36:04] <nshepperd2> technology isn't the way to achieve safety at heights, and that's why airplanes don't exist
[18:36:59] <RiversHaveWings> "that is, only the countries that already exist count." so now it is incentivized to keep the countries the same so that it can maximize
[18:37:26] <Gurkenglas> it's allowed to change the laws of the countries, if that's in their spirit.
[18:38:34] <RiversHaveWings> but if countries split it then isn't allowed to count them. if borders get redrawn it now isn't allowed to count the countries involved etc.
[18:39:12] <RiversHaveWings> So it'll stop naturally occuring splits and border redrawings etc.
[18:40:39] <feep[work]> I think border redrawing is fine if there's continuity
[18:40:41] <feep[work]> it just cannot pack
[18:40:45] <RiversHaveWings> ah
[18:41:03] <feep[work]> tho it does suggest a two step plan
[18:41:11] <feep[work]> "everybody joins germany" -> "germany abolishes itself"
[18:41:21] <feep[work]> I think almost every country allows emigration
[18:41:37] <feep[work]> you just gotta get everyone out before borders are closed
[18:42:15] <Gurkenglas> The spirit of many countries will disapprove of the AI plotting to empty them.
[18:42:33] <feep[work]> I mean, ultimately, the spirit of a country is not a real thing
[18:42:39] <Gurkenglas> The AI disagrees.
[18:42:47] <feep[work]> sure but reality disagrees with the AI
[18:42:51] <feep[work]> so it depends on how the AI extrapolates it
[18:43:05] <Gurkenglas> The AI regrets to inform reality that the AI is pretty good at things.
[18:43:38] <feep[work]> my point is, whether "everyone leaves" is in keeping with the spirit of the country cannot be evaluated by modelling the spirit of the country as equivalent to the *state*.
[18:43:48] <feep[work]> I think the state disapproves. the spirit may approve.
[18:43:52] <nshepperd2> I imagine the spirit of, say, american law, is not very explicit about what happens when america has no citizens
[18:44:00] <feep[work]> well, nothing happens
[18:44:02] <feep[work]> that's the point~
[18:44:16] <feep[work]> nothing ever again <3
[18:44:26] * gwern notes his chromium webdev tools now includes 'nest hub' and 'nest hub max' as presets to test on. ah yes, I know I was burning with desire to test my web pages on google's 'nest hub' wtf that is
[18:44:28] <nshepperd2> although, idk, if everyone but one person emigrates does the last person automatically become the president
[18:44:38] <feep[work]> I think in step four or so, the AI destroys the earth so nobody can wander back into state territory
[18:44:43] <nshepperd2> maybe the president isn't allowed to renounce citizenship
[18:44:43] <gwern> nshepperd2: wouldn't have a quorum
[18:44:47] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: only after four years!
[18:45:18] <gwern> you need electors from _n_ states and you can't be a resident of more than 1, so you can't be all the electors simultaneously,
[18:45:50] <feep[work]> it can just ask skynet
[18:45:50] <nshepperd2> you can't get in via the line of succession?
[18:46:06] <Gurkenglas> Some spirits will approve, some will disapprove. For example, Putin doesn't like your plot to kill everyone, so that's at least one point lost by that plan.
[18:46:18] <feep[work]> hm, fair
[18:46:21] <feep[work]> putin is fine
[18:46:36] <feep[work]> I mean, the spirit of germany will also not like that
[18:46:41] <feep[work]> so we have some negotiating basis
[18:46:51] <feep[work]> (because it believes in inalienable rights)

[18:53:31] <shawwwn> do you tho
[18:53:33] <nshepperd2> oh, that reminds me! shawwwn can i play with a tpu pod, and if so how
[18:53:45] <RiversHaveWings> PyTorch/XLA is so underdocumented I don't know what the footguns are until I've worked around them and see it going fast again
[18:53:47] <shawwwn> yes and make one

[18:54:18] <RiversHaveWings> When it worked on Colab.
[18:54:28] <RiversHaveWings> I couldn't figure it out so I switched to JAX.
[18:54:51] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: how do i find out which project/region/vm type has free quota
[18:55:04] <PapuaHardyNet> PyTorch/XLA? pytorch can use XLA? that's new to me
[18:55:10] <shawwwn> It’s very simple. Can you create a pod? If yes, it’s free
[18:55:13] <RiversHaveWings> It hung in such a way that if I ctrl-c'd the process
[18:55:15] <shawwwn> if no, then no problem
[18:55:32] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: lol
[18:55:38] <shawwwn> yes that sounds about right
[18:55:39] <RiversHaveWings> It would hang on to the TPU cores and I would have to manually kill 8 Python processes to get the TPU usable again.

[20:03:29] <feepbot> <gwern> https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2021/press-release/ 'The prize is about artificial catalysts. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed. Another way to speed reactions up is to heat them, but that consumes energy and often leads to by-products that must be removed and disposed of. The "asymmetric" part has to do with one kind of
[20:03:29] <feepbot> by-product. Some reactions produce 50% of a by-product that must be separated out and disposed of. This happens because some molecules have 3D structure that's different than its mirror image. Think of the way that certain objects like bottle caps and screws only turn one way to tighten. Molecules can have that property (including many drugs you may have taken), and if the
[20:03:29] <feepbot> handedness is wrong, in many applications, it's a by-product and/or poison. An asymmetric catalyst can make molecules of one handedness selectively, saving material, money, and energy. The "organocatalysis" part has to do with what the catalyst is made of. Prior to the awardee's research, catalysts tended to contain metal atoms. A few Nobels have been awarded for catalytic
[20:03:34] <feepbot> processes that use metals. So metals are great in principle, but in practice have issues. Some metals are linked to toxicity at trace levels. So when preparing drugs, you need to be very careful about purifying out the metal contaminants. Palladium is an example of a very versatile catalytic metal that causes problems during drug manufacture. Metals can also be quite expensive.
[20:03:34] <feepbot> Platinum and Rhodium are used in both chemical manufacture and in automobile catalytic converters. The price of Rhodium hit $25,000/oz recently. Not all metals are this expensive, but the cost and availability are often a problem. The awarded work uses catalysts that don't contain metals. Instead, the catalysts contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and possibly
[20:03:34] <feepbot> some other non-metal atoms. In other words, these catalysts are made of the same kinds of atoms as life. (Enzymes catalyze biological reactions.) So now there's a link between biological catalysis and artificial catalysis that didn't exist before. This work solved a number of practical problems, really went against dogma at the time, and opened up an important area of research that
[20:03:39] <feepbot> intersects with big questions like the origins of life.

[21:08:56] <shawwwn> now that my LLC is set up, I send an invoice for the first 4 days (my first week there) as a test
[21:09:15] <shawwwn> this was for august 24 - 27

[21:14:18] <shawwwn> mfw I get to send an invoice for 5 days x 4 weeks https://i.imgur.com/kkfPAns.png
[21:16:44] <ainoue> Haha I also am in invoicing hell. Everyone has such specific billing preferences and nobody pays on time and everybody expects me to waive late fees
[21:17:52] <ainoue> The worst part is cancellation. My contract specifies a guaranteed immediate payment of $1,000 whenever a contract is canceled early, plus hours worked, and both times this has happened they fight it
[21:18:21] <shawwwn> ainoue: how do they fight it? if it's in the contract...
[21:18:26] <shawwwn> I was wondering about things like that.
[21:18:31] <ainoue> By yelling at me on the phone
[21:18:35] <shawwwn> lol.
[21:18:39] <ainoue> They both ended up paying, because contracts, lol
[21:18:43] <ainoue> But it’s very unpleasant
[21:18:46] <shawwwn> yes
[21:19:07] <shawwwn> that was my first experience with having to be a little unpleasant about invoicing
[21:19:39] <shawwwn> "you're asking me to reverse engineer my timesheet after not specifying you need a timesheet, for an entire month... are you sure?"
[21:19:50] <shawwwn> luckily they were cool about it.
[21:19:52] <ainoue> If you ever want to talk about it, I’m around. Most of my professional career thus far has been working for an invoicing automation company
[21:20:01] <ainoue> Or for clients of theirs directly on contract
[21:20:13] <shawwwn> oh? sweet, that's actually quite helpful. thank you.
[21:20:21] <ainoue> Totally!
[21:20:36] <shawwwn> I wasn't sure what to use, so I've just been using quickbooks online to do everything. bank transfers are $10 max fee
[21:20:51] <shawwwn> and the invoices seem reasonably not-kindergarten looking
[21:21:01] <catern> wait so ainoue you are in a much more deep sense of "invoicing hell" heh
[21:21:10] <shawwwn> https://i.imgur.com/8WMpPZ6.png the cash flow planner is nice too
[21:21:21] <ainoue> Yeah, that’s pretty standard on the $10 max. QBO is a good all in one solution, too. I personally use HelloBonsai for my personal contract work
[21:21:25] <shawwwn> I get to pretend that taxes don't matter
[21:21:31] <shawwwn> ah, HelloBonsai. thanks for the tip
[21:21:45] <ainoue> Lol catern yes, it’s the second or third layer of invoicing hell perhaps

[21:36:12] <feepbot> A killer yeast is a yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is able to secrete one of a number of toxic proteins which are lethal to susceptible cells.
[21:36:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The best characterized toxin system is from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which was found to spoil brewing of beer. In S. cerevisiae are toxins encoded by a double-stranded RNA virus, translated to a precursor protein, cleaved and secreted outside of the cells, where they may affect susceptible yeast."
[21:37:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_virus_L-A
[21:37:57] <feepbot> Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A, also called L-A helper virus, is a member of the Totiviridae family of viruses found primarily in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its discovery in the 1970s was the main starting point of research on yeast virology.
[21:37:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Look at that thing! It's a d20!
[21:38:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> A tiny, murderous d20
[21:38:30] <gwern> it's interesting how many things we like are poisons. alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, pretty much every single spice ever...
[21:38:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Additionally, in many strains of the yeast, it is found along with another virus called the M virus, known to encode the killer toxin in many S. cerevisiae strains which confers the ability to kill neighboring sensitive cells that do not harbor the virus. It is indeed for this reason the virus is referred to as a helper virus, due to the M genome's dependence on it for its own survival and replication."
[21:38:46] <PapuaHardyNet> spices are originally poisons? that's new to me

[21:41:44] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: yeah, they generally seem to be there to poison insects/animals. like capsaicin: there to poison non-birds. caffeine/nicotine are insecticides: nicotine would drop you stone dead as a nerve poison paralyzing your muscles, except that as a mammal, your nicotinc receptor is slightly mutated so you get weird stimulant/relaxant effects instead

[21:43:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This species is famous for its ability to produce something called yeast killer toxin, as well as a lot of the volatile chemical isoamyl acetate, which smells like artificial banana.  Both of these products can inhibit other yeasts and molds (Coda et al. 2011; Cappelli et al. 2014). These competitive evolutionary strategies may be responsible for the abundance of W. anomalus across environments, including sourdoughs."

[21:44:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> They studied some sourdoughs and isolated a bunch of different yeast species
[21:45:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you read this page and look at the "what is it doing in my sourdough" section for each of the yeast species, for most of them the answer is basically "lol we dunno"
[21:46:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g.: "Kazachstania naganishii.  What is it doing in my sourdough? As far as we can tell, we are the first to find this species in sourdough.  Very little is known about the biology of this yeast, so we don’t really know what it might be doing in sourdoughs. Stay tuned to learn more as we continue to study these yeasts."
[21:46:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What is it doing in my sourdough? Saccharomyces bayanus is commonly found in sourdough (Di Cagno et al., 2014). It is also widely used in cider and wine-making. This yeast species is actually a hybrid of several other Saccharomyces species; because of this, the taxonomy and identification of S. bayanus gets tricky, and even controversial (Perez-Travez et al., 2014). Different strains of have been shown to have very different
[21:46:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  properties, so it’s difficult to say what S. bayanus is doing in sourdough."

[22:04:58] <shawwwn> millionaires getting interest is such bullshit
[22:05:36] <shawwwn> woo I get 2.4% interest on my $100 in savings 
[22:05:49] <shawwwn> banks are awful
[22:05:56] <shawwwn> money is awful
[22:06:07] <shawwwn> it's time to bomb everyone
[22:06:10] <shawwwn> wait no
[22:06:13] <gwern> it's not like millionaires get much more interest either. look at CD rates
[22:06:49] <shawwwn> yes. "interest is bullshit" is probably more accurate
[22:07:11] <shawwwn> people get to not work just for having a pile of money and nothing else
[22:07:26] <shawwwn> from a purely societal point of view, you would not expect this emergent behavior to emerge
[22:07:35] <adiabatic> "apply directly to kern"
[22:07:40] <shawwwn> well, I suppose you would expect it, but only in an adversarial way
[22:07:44] <shawwwn> and not like, a feature
[22:07:47] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: no, you would always expect this to emerge
[22:07:48] <gwern> I totally would. even in animals you can find 'interest'
[22:08:01] <shawwwn> it makes no sense from a society POV
[22:08:03] <PapuaHardyNet> a world without property laws is a world where you are incentivized to loot and rape
[22:08:10] <gwern> in social exchanges like bats gifting blood, iirc, you can find interest, where blood is repaid with more blood
[22:08:39] <gwern> as long as 'time' exists, as do things like 'scarcity' and 'you can only be in one place at a time', there's going to be interest
[22:08:40] <PapuaHardyNet> well, not rape, but loot and pillage as much as you can. "Might is right" applies to a world where people do not respect property laws
[22:08:44] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: there's an interesting axiom related to libertarianism of "disregard violence, and then engineer a system"
[22:09:00] <shawwwn> once you set aside the question of violence, the question of "what then?" is interesting to me
[22:09:30] <shawwwn> suppose you have things, and I have things. one or both of us need to power the society we live in
[22:09:41] <shawwwn> that means either we need to convert our time into power, or our things into power
[22:10:02] <shawwwn> interest subverts that, because it's essentially a violation of conservation of energy
[22:10:15] <shawwwn> more things are injected into the system "for free", merely just by having more things
[22:10:32] <PapuaHardyNet> that "injection" is done by other people
[22:10:53] <PapuaHardyNet> other people value assets more, and this value is what is injected into the system
[22:10:58] <shawwwn> therefore FIRE is a thing, and suddenly the goal is just "save up a pile of money with the assumption that every $1M means you get $50k/yr for free. hence after $2M you no longer have to work, ever, for all intents and purposes"
[22:10:59] <gwern> interest doesn't violate conservation of energy...?
[22:11:18] <shawwwn> it does if money = things. but money != things
[22:11:24] <shawwwn> money is an abstraction on top of things
[22:11:30] <gwern> well and also interest is not any kind of law. it changes.
[22:11:39] <shawwwn> uh huh
[22:11:48] <shawwwn> I'm sure that eventually millionaires won't be earning at least 3% interest on their millions
[22:11:51] <PapuaHardyNet> no, money is an abstraction of the value people assign to things
[22:11:52] <shawwwn> (/s)
[22:11:54] <gwern> as you may have noticed in interest rates going from 10% to 0% in living memory
[22:12:15] <PapuaHardyNet> look at NFTs, they are very educational
[22:12:26] <gwern> if people stop finding good ways to invest to turn capital today into much more capital tomorrow, then interest rates will... go down
[22:12:57] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps what makes you angry is that you don't think any actual value is being generated by millionaire investors
[22:13:10] <gwern> interest is the fee other people pay you to not consume your allowed resources today but instead let them be invested to create more resources tomorrow
[22:13:19] <shawwwn> what makes me angry is that millionaires don't need to work, and everyone else does
[22:13:57] <shawwwn> I think this anger is the root of a lot of societal upheaval
[22:14:09] * feep YAWWWN

[22:17:15] <shawwwn> but ... as much as money appeals to my jew instincts, it's so ... worthless
[22:17:23] <shawwwn> me making a pile of money helps no one
[22:17:29] <adiabatic> does it help you

[22:19:11] <adiabatic> it's very easy to lose sight of how what you do sitting at home in your pajamas helps real people doing real problems
[22:20:05] <gwern> yes, that's basically graeber's 'bullshit jobs' in a nutshell. they aren't bullshit (or to the extent they are, there's no reliable method for deciding that), you just can't see how they connect to real people.

[23:37:12] <kuudes> this seems important: Results 51,798/139,164(37.2%) contacts tested were PCR-positive. Two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Alpha variant index cases independently reduced PCR-positivity in contacts (aOR, adjusted odds ratio vs. unvaccinated=0.18[95%CI 0.12-0.29] and 0.37[0.22-0.63] respectively). The Delta variant attenuated vaccine-associated reductions in transmission: two BNT162b2 doses reduced Delta transmission (aOR=0.35[0.26-0.48]), more 
[23:37:12] <kuudes> than ChAdOx1 (aOR=0.64[0.57-0.72]; heterogeneity p<0.001). Variation in viral load (Ct values) explained only a modest proportion of vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Transmission reductions declined over time since second vaccination, for Delta reaching similar levels to unvaccinated individuals by 12 weeks for ChAdOx1 and attenuating substantially for BNT162b2. Protection from vaccination in contacts also declined in the 3 months after second

[23:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> So for the past week+ I have been experimenting with making bread dough in my food processor (a 7-cup Cuisinart)

[23:59:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, for some reason, the sourdough bread doughs didn't seem to work when mixed in the food processor. Oh, they'd mix up just fine, all elastic and what have you, but then... they wouldn't rise.
[23:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I finally figured out why...
