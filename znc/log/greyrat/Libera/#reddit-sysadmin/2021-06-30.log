[10:16:57] <DrZak> incredible india
[10:17:26] <xe0n> well sometimes not all MFA solutions cover everything?
[10:17:34] <xe0n> i had a mix between duo and azure mfa at last place
[10:17:41] <DrZak> huh?
[10:17:50] <DrZak> its a stupid idiotic https everywhere
[10:18:00] <DrZak> how is that not able to work
[10:18:18] <xe0n> whats https got to do with rdp or something?
[10:18:30] <xe0n> i dunno what your using em for, i was just saying in general, not all mfa solutions cover everything lol
[10:18:44] <xe0n> so sometimes you needa have more than one? i dunno
[10:18:44] <DrZak> lets go with - all apps behind it are standard, that are supported by all major mfa things
[10:18:45] <xe0n> lol!
[10:18:57] <DrZak> its just some retard failing at his useless existence
[10:18:58] <xe0n> okay then there's other reasons maybe? i dunno lol!
[10:19:29] <xe0n> wait arent you the dude who wanted to modify email headers so you could put your own troubleshooting notes in there?
[10:19:29] <xe0n> LOL
[10:19:35] <DrZak> in here 99% somebody statred the deployment without talking to anybody and after investing moneys they simply let it go
[10:19:45] <DrZak> xe0n: i am doing that
[10:19:48] <xe0n> LOLL
[10:19:51] <DrZak> it works very well!
[10:19:54] <xe0n> i bet...
[10:19:59] <xe0n> so does mail trace and the tools ;x
[10:20:00] <xe0n> loll
[10:20:05] <DrZak> for me yes
[10:20:28] <DrZak> but then again, my southasian colleagues got used to certain way of doing things on the ironport
[10:20:34] <DrZak> and no deviation is permitted
[10:20:44] <DrZak> coz then i would need to run 20 hours of training
[10:20:57] <xe0n> well you're just changing things up for the sake of doing it lol
[10:21:03] <DrZak> exactly
[10:21:10] <xe0n> im the same at work - we have a process to do certain things, follow the process, dont deviate off the path else you'll know
[10:21:46] <DrZak> but tbh. i have to say its fairly comfortable really
[10:22:01] <DrZak> 'dude, mail came in wrong' - open the mail, look at the header - voila
[10:22:16] <xe0n> yeah if i saw that i'd be disabling it ;)
[10:22:47] <xe0n> whatever
[10:22:53] <xe0n> is it 5pm yet?

[11:53:50] <riff-IRC> also yea
[11:54:16] <riff-IRC> kinda like the various control packages we offered with our generator control systems
[11:54:31] <crustacean> riff-IRC: I am quite good actually
[11:54:44] <crustacean> I probably found a new job
[11:54:52] <riff-IRC> most of the packages we sold were the standard variety- monitor the utility power and transfer to generator when utility either fails or goues out of spec
[11:54:58] <riff-IRC> crustacean: Nice
[11:56:14] <crustacean> I am just taking it easy, I'll make the hop soon
[11:58:17] <riff-IRC> The most expensive package we ever sold was a very exotic one- 8-channel InterLine Powerline Synchronization System, dual out-of-band management systems, also had the System Supervisory module installed, plus remote substation management with the LPI Remote Substation Monitoring and Control Kit
[11:58:49] <riff-IRC> $1.5M per control system with dual redundant control systems, so $3M for that
[11:59:12] <riff-IRC> Plus another $850K for the switchgear itself
[12:00:38] <riff-IRC> LPI TwinTrip III for the HV side, then LPI TwinStak II for MV switching (6900V to 1500V) and TriStak III for the LV (850V and below) switching
[12:01:57] <riff-IRC> And then we also used LPI DC/II switchgear for the battery interrupters on the generators and UPSs the company had installed
[12:03:01] *** Joins: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm)
[12:03:02] <riff-IRC> We also used LPI SynchroStak gear for performing line synchronization.
[12:04:38] <xe0n> you very much should work sell ups setups to companies
[12:04:45] <xe0n> like make that your entire career
[12:05:07] *** Joins: Aoyagi_raventop (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[12:05:19] <riff-IRC> 2 different utility feeds with 3 generators backing each feed. 13.2kV in, stepped down to 4160V and 2400V, then the 4160V side went to MV motors and whatnot. The 2400V side was used as an internal MV bus and stepped down to an appropriate voltage where appropriate.
[12:06:40] <crustacean> I feel my knowledge increase everytime you talk about your career
[12:06:41] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> so...power stuff.
[12:06:48] <riff-IRC> yep

[12:07:35] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> that's six more
[12:07:38] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> much better
[12:07:44] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> but more exxpensive
[12:07:52] <riff-IRC> IIRC, we ordered 2 custom computer cases for the control systems, as well as custom motherboards.
[12:08:31] <riff-IRC> We had around 13 EISA cards per system.
[12:08:41] <Jay-HPWebOS-Ros> that's a lot of EISAs
[12:08:48] <riff-IRC> yep
[12:10:53] <riff-IRC> one of our newer guys at the time (April 1990) phoned my extension when the order came in, asking me "did you fat-finger the order or something? because there's like 26 EISA cards in this box."

[13:12:35] <csws> Dear Contractor,
[13:12:35] <csws> As you would likely be aware, the Australian Government has legislated changes to the percentages of Superannuation Guarantee for workers.
[13:12:35] <csws> The next increase is due to occur from 1 July 2021 when the SGC will increase from 9.5% to 10%.
[13:12:35] <csws> We have been in discussions with our clients to determine if they will accommodate the 0.5% increase to their rates, so that your fee can be increased by the commensurate amount. 
[13:12:35] <csws> Unfortunately, in this instance, your host client has indicated they will not accommodate the increase. This stance appears to be the industry standard.
[13:12:36] <csws> Please be advised that while the total of your overall fee will remain unchanged, another 0.5% of your fee will be remitted to your superannuation fund as per the legislative requirements. 
[13:12:42] <csws> fuck sake
[13:14:16] <teh_f4ll3n> xe0n, then again, I'm on here, ain't I?

[15:32:54] <badsnappa> Dylan - why do you need to prompt for anything?
[15:33:37] <badsnappa> OU for each type of workstation, workstation types correspond to roles (design, finance team, developers, marketing etc..)
[15:34:03] <badsnappa> OU thus defines configuration that is applied to the machine when it is built

[15:35:13] <sd> 14<D‚Äãylan> In the DeploymentWorkbench I can assign Task sequences but the things I can prompt there are always key value pairs.

[15:36:00] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> @Dylan just a thought, but could you not just use a task sequence variable, and prompt for it at the beginning of the imaging process?
[15:36:10] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> kind of like how we use OSDComputerName to name the machine when imaging
[15:36:14] <xe0n> yeah... i said that
[15:36:24] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> since we can't automatically just name the machine based on bios attributes
[15:37:38] <sd> 14<D‚Äãylan> The problem with the prompt solution is that I don't know how many items they want to add. Each item has 4 attributes.
[15:37:38] <sd> 14<D‚Äãylan> The GUI can ask me one variable
[15:38:04] <sd> 14<D‚Äãylan> I could ask how many items first and then iterate over the result
[15:38:06] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> And.... you can ask for multiple task sequence variables at the beginning?
[15:38:20] <xe0n> he doesn't want to read the documentation

[15:59:23] <badsnappa> Windows 10 made me convert almost totally to Linux. I retained 1 WinX desktop. I'm not sure whether I can really be bothered to buy a new machine for Windows 11.

[16:00:10] <badsnappa> Windows 8 / 8.1 was the best version of Windows imho
[16:00:22] <badsnappa> (I don't expect everyone to agree with me)
[16:00:24] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> Win10 was a huge step forward in supportability/deployment/management though

[16:00:38] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> I went over because of under the hood changes (which Win10 continued)
[16:00:47] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> but I loved the full screen start menu

[16:01:23] <CptLuxx> same
[16:01:30] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> Win7 i was using the mouse a fair amount too though
[16:01:44] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> but that's what happens when you got 30+ results for a search term because you have that many different variations/versions
[16:01:54] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> especailly with things like multiple VS installs for a specific type of console
[16:02:17] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> 8 was so much faster with the keyboard, 7 and 10 mouse is faster, in those scenarios, even after narrowing down with search
[16:03:10] <badsnappa> I'm not much of a mouser tbh, by wrists/hands don't like it
[16:03:37] <Oliber> i just hope we'll finally have one control panel/settings UI, the split in win10 has always been infuriating
[16:03:38] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> I just find keyboard to be generally faster for navigating - I type stupidly fast so it's a thing, mouse i'm better at for things like precision moving though

[22:02:10] <JollyRgrs> @Dylan uh.... that's not the right question?
[22:02:27] <JollyRgrs> PS version will be whatever your PE image has

[22:03:29] <JollyRgrs> MDT *USES* PS, but it doesn't install it
[22:03:42] <JollyRgrs> so whatever PE image you are using, is what PS it has
[22:04:15] <JollyRgrs> MDT can make images with whatever version windows you want
[22:04:29] <JollyRgrs> so it could be MDT for W7 RTM, so what? PS 2.0?
[22:04:44] <JollyRgrs> or it could be the very latest/greatest W11 and whatever PS version that comes with
