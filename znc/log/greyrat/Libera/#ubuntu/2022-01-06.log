[01:56:18] <MrCollinsGA> so I installed ubuntu and have xrdp installed, every time I login I get 'please authenticate to create color profile' I followed the help on this link https://devanswers.co/how-to-fix-authentication-is-required-to-create-a-color-profile-managed-device-on-ubuntu-20-04-20-10/
[01:56:42] <MrCollinsGA> now every time I login it gives me a prompt that there is a system problem report or cancel. ugh
[01:57:53] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: Can you test it directly (without rdp)?
[01:58:03] <MrCollinsGA> doesnt happen unless im in rdp
[01:58:08] <leftyfb> MrCollinsGA: again, I thought we decided on doing everything automated over SSH, not GUI?
[01:58:22] <MrCollinsGA> i have the actual terminal close to me
[01:58:46] <MrCollinsGA> leftyfb, I cant. I dont know enough about bash to hash everything out. It woudl take me ages to figure out a script and write it.
[01:59:24] <MrCollinsGA> I have a few examples and I am patient but I dont have the time. After I get this working I will find a way to get it via just terminal. I appreciate you remembering.
[02:00:46] <MrCollinsGA> the script I need is make kden project files or the MLT files that kden outputs script from the command line or in terminal. I hit that brick wall. I dont expect anyone to help me with that that is something I have to tackle on my own. :(

[03:07:58] <rfm> devslash, just from the message it sounds like maybe the initram got messed up somehow.  There's a way to trigger rebuilding it but I don't know it offhand.  Maybe just reinstall the kernel package?
[03:08:35] <devslash> im doing that more or less with apt
[03:09:12] <rfm> devslash, yeah, I think upgrading the firmware package is one of the many things that will trigger a initram update.

[04:51:06] <sarnold> zenof: I suggest letting it "recover the files" and then try viewing them ;) you may find bugs in your photo viewing software..
[04:51:26] <zenof> that's right and should work like this. but when it finds a jpeg header, it shouldn't find the whole jpeg, right?!

[05:19:03] <zenof> I am just about trying it again. what could prevent or notice I am writing only zeros? I mean, even if so, the fs wouldn't run out of space, if something between cat and the crypto layer would be that "smart", right?

[05:49:39] <ELQEYNN> Is Trinity another Linux distro?
[05:50:19] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, it is a fork of KDE 3.5
[05:50:21] <genii-core> ELQEYNN: Trinity is an independent effort to preserve the 3.x series of KDE, which was much beloved by some
[05:50:51] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, I wouldn't risk talking about an other distro in the ubuntu channel ;)

[05:52:15] <Nobrem> genii-core, well, let's be real,  Ubuntu == Kubuntu
[05:52:28] <ELQEYNN> GNOME can have the look and feel of Windows.
[05:52:39] <transhumanist> HI! why is it after using dd if= one usb disk flash disk that is 16 gig in size and outputing it to  a 256 gig usb flash disk, I end up running out of space on the copy?

[05:55:05] <Nobrem> thank you for the screenshot
[05:55:10] <genii-core> ELQEYNN: KDE in general is less of a transition for Windows users than many other desktops, yes

[05:55:39] *** Joins: dbristow (~dbristow@user/dbristow)
[05:55:45] <Nobrem> genii-core, there was a bug in KDE 4 _many_ years ago which was marked as "won't fix" in the bug tracker
[05:56:01] <Nobrem> genii-core, when using 2 rows,  and you open a new window, the minimized windows change position in the task bar
[05:56:09] <Nobrem> which made it so hard to find the windows
[05:56:29] <sarnold> transhumanist: maybe do ls -l on the path you used in dd's of=... parameter -- I've seen that become a regular file more than once :)
[05:56:49] <genii-core> Nobrem: I have grouping on for apps on the taskbar and it doesn't seem to be an issue
[05:56:51] <ELQEYNN> With a clickable icon for each software that one might want to run, that is the look and feel of Windows.
[05:57:51] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, why would you even _want_ it to feel like Windows?
[05:57:56] <genii-core> Nobrem: This machine is running Kubuntu 18.04 fairly well, and it's an Acer from 2008, Core2 Duo CPU and hard drives swapped out to SSDs, still works well
[05:58:19] <Nobrem> lovely
[05:58:26] <ELQEYNN> Oh ... it's what I wanted in the beginning.
[05:59:01] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, the command line is your friend
[05:59:26] <genii-core> Nobrem: There is a text entry box now when you click on the gears which I just use more than krunner these days
[05:59:36] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, you can even edit videos in the command line (ffmpeg),  do graphic editing (image magick),  work on sounds (sox),  copy (cp),  move (mv), create directories (mkdir) and so on

[06:01:02] <Nobrem> stupid question, totally useless, but it boggles my mind.

[07:29:10] <Nobrem> re
[07:29:32] <Nobrem> I am just running the installation of Ubuntu (Server) from a pen drive onto a newly bought, SECOND HAND computer
[07:29:42] <Nobrem> Now I have 2 questions:
[07:30:04] <Nobrem> 1) the installer does NOT offer me to Zero the harddrive.... how problematic is this in regards to a second hand computer?
[07:30:06] *** Parts: babyface (~babyface@user/babyface) ()
[07:30:28] <Nobrem> should I stop the installation before beginning it and Zero the hard drive using some other means?
[07:30:37] <Nobrem> or is it not important to zero the HD ?
[07:30:53] <LjL> whether it's important or not is just up to what you are comfortable with
[07:31:00] <LjL> doesn't the installer offer a full format? that usually means zeroing
[07:31:01] <Nobrem> 2) Why is there no SWAP partition in the suggested setup?  There is not a single SWAP space suggested
[07:31:15] <Nobrem> LjL, maybe the next step... maybe I am not that far (yet)
[07:31:22] <Nobrem> LjL, I am using the Server Edition of Ubuntu
[07:31:44] <Nobrem> LjL, it's a laptop, but I want a custom desktop manager so I wanted to be smart by using the non-graphical installer
[07:31:50] <Nobrem> maybe that just bites me in the ***
[07:32:08] <Nobrem> because the graphical installer can defintely zero a HD because it also lets me "test" ubuntu and then I can open up a command line
[07:32:24] <Nobrem> is it even important to zero it?
[07:32:34] <Nobrem> I never understood the benefit, but people in here told me it were important
[07:32:39] <Nobrem> not today, in the past
[07:34:33] <Nobrem> ...and why is there no SWAP partition suggested by the installer?
[07:34:46] <Nobrem> I would like to give it 32 GB of RAM
[07:34:49] <Nobrem> erm... swap
[07:34:55] *** Joins: eelstrebor (~eelstrebo@198-178-29-136.scb.ne.static.allophone.net)
[07:34:59] <LjL> Nobrem, if you don't zero it, you may still have files, or pieces of files, on the drive, that are recoverable the day someone decides to recover it, belonging to the previous user
[07:35:10] <LjL> are you comfortable with that? it could be illegal content for all you know
[07:35:16] <Nobrem> oh!
[07:35:20] <Nobrem> ok, zeroing it is
[07:35:26] <LjL> as to the swap i've no idea, i haven't actually used ubuntu in some years
[07:35:31] <LjL> but i think these days people tend to shun swap
[07:35:38] <Nobrem> why so?
[07:35:40] <LjL> not sure if it's just a fad
[07:36:00] <Nobrem> I am going to do some 4K video cutting so I might need it?
[07:36:05] <LjL> probably because RAM is plentiful and swap is slow and tends to make the system fail more painfully (i.e. death by slowdown rather than just apps crashing)
[07:36:15] <LjL> you can add a swapfile later easily anyway
[07:36:20] <Nobrem> okay, then I rather buy more RAM
[07:36:25] <Nobrem> really?!  #later
[07:36:26] <LjL> a swap partition isn't particularly necessary
[07:36:34] <Nobrem> okay, good, I believe you
[07:36:53] <Nobrem> LjL, would you mind holding on for ~2-3 min?

[07:39:31] <Nobrem> bad news
[07:39:36] <Nobrem> there was no zeroing option
[07:39:44] <Nobrem> the installation is running
[07:40:02] <Nobrem> could anyone from the internet use remainders of old files in order to hack into my computer?

[07:42:40] <genii-core> By the time someone gained enough access to your computer to recover old files it would already be compromised without bothering to recover anything old
[07:42:52] <Nobrem> ok great
[07:42:54] <Nobrem> thank you
[07:43:01] <Nobrem> The harddrive is LUKS encrypted
[07:43:03] <Nobrem> does that help?
[07:43:08] <Nobrem> (I set that during the installation)
[07:43:43] <Nobrem> by the way,  Ubuntu has come a long way... the installation routine of the server edition is pretty awesome
[07:44:02] <Nobrem> Thank you, developers, if you are here :)
[07:45:09] <Nobrem> the installation is complete
[07:45:14] <Nobrem> Now I must try to get X running

[07:54:03] <LjL> but likely not
[07:54:21] <LjL> but as genii said you don't rick being broken into *because* of the old data on the hard drive, that's not a factor

[07:54:50] <Nobrem> Guys, I love this server install
[07:54:58] <Nobrem> this is the best experience I have had in a long time
[07:55:10] <Nobrem> after restarting the computer, it was even _online_ (connected to my wifi)

[18:41:05] <nucc1> have a look at /usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service
[18:41:36] <merpnderp> I don't know. https://pastebin.com ?
[18:41:47] <nucc1> i think it mounts tmpfile with nodev already
[18:41:49] <merpnderp> Ubuntu has one, but you have to create an account to use it.
[18:41:59] <nucc1> so could well be an issue with your vulnerability scanner
[18:42:17] <nucc1> for example, if it's looking for the definition of /tmp in /etc/fstab, then it won't find it
[18:42:41] <nucc1> also, if you run "cat /etc/mtab" , you will see that tmpfs already has "nodev" flag.
[18:43:23] <merpnderp> What about remount?
[18:43:27] <merpnderp> Apparently I need that too
[18:43:39] <nucc1> i am not sure i see how it's relevant...
[18:43:49] <nucc1> is remount even a tool?
[18:43:57] <nucc1> i mean, to remount, you just call mount again
[18:44:17] <nucc1> perhaps you should clarify what you mean by remount
[18:44:23] <nucc1> or what exactly you need to address about it
[18:44:28] <merpnderp> no idea. In the remediation guide from the scanner I'm supposed to do this: mount -o remount,nodev /tmp
[18:44:49] <merpnderp> Or edit: /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount and add: Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid
[18:44:50] <nucc1> remount in that context means "allow possibility to remount the filesystem with different options"
[18:44:56] <merpnderp> Only that file doesn't exist.
[18:44:57] <nucc1> that's a pointless stipulation in my view.

[18:52:31] <leftyfb> merpnderp: the main point you missed here is the whole purpose of a /tmp mount is that it is mounted as tmpfs, which is all in memory. Not a filesystem on a disk, regardless of where the mountpoint is

Packages that are marked auto-installed are eligible for removal via `apt autoremove`.

[23:03:58] <jkc> MrCollinsGA: It is considered an IRC social error to crosspost questions. Keep your questions to the channel that supports the OS you're currently using.
[23:03:59] <oerheks> i am tired of that.
[23:04:13] <MrCollinsGA> what do you mean?

[23:04:23] <MrCollinsGA> I only asked this question in one channel?
[23:04:32] <jkc> Then I misunderstood oerheks.
[23:05:04] <MrCollinsGA> i only ask questions in one channel until maybe 24 hours if no one answers ill try another channel or just keep searching
[23:05:32] <MrCollinsGA> I start at google and search first. I never want to bother anyone.
[23:05:53] <oerheks> you just put questions out everywhere, so i take it no longer seriously.
