[00:02:31] <maerwald> don't have a clear opinion yet

[00:37:23] <maerwald> that should do
[00:41:29] <maerwald> eh, in fact that makes no sense
[00:41:33] <maerwald> I think I need sleep :D
[00:41:40] * maerwald leaves
[00:42:40] <maerwald> TS code needs more concentration than I'm used to from Haskell :P
[01:09:51] <shapr> I need sleep also

[02:53:01] <maerwald> I decided to not sleep and fixed it fendor[m] :p
[02:53:39] <maerwald> now it considers all locally compiled versions and merges the metadata with the installed versions, preferring installed versions
[02:54:20] <maerwald> so if metadata says HLS-1.6.1.0 supports GHC-8.10.6, but the user has installed 1.6.1.0 via `ghcup compile` and 8.10.6 is not supported, the extenstion will recognize
[02:55:12] <maerwald> and we do not overwrite user-compiled versions
[02:58:15] <maerwald> I think by now no one will understand this logic and I shouldn't optimize it further

[19:05:55] <salman69e27> Hello, I was attempting issue #462 (https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/462) and I have a question. Is this the right place to ask?
[19:10:18] <fendor[m]> salman69e27: yes it is!
[19:17:53] <salman69e27> I wanted to start by providing a code action to auto-fill missing fields (`Person{}` to `Person{firstName = _wf, lastName = _wg}`). As someone pointed out there is already a warning by ghc for missing fields and a 'Disable "missing-fields" warnings' action associated with it. I wanted to look at the provider of that action, but I can't find it. I
[19:17:54] <salman69e27> thought it might be a general action (Disable <warning> warnings) but still no luck

[20:27:34] <salman69e2751> fendor[m] sorry my internet connection is not stable and I get disconnected a lot. I'm not sure if anyone responded to my question or not. Is there any other place I can ask?
[20:30:11] <drsooch[m]> There’s also discord server but let me take a look I don’t know off the top of my head who owns that action
[20:35:41] <salman69e2751> Do you mean the haskell-tooling channel in the Functional Programming discord server?
[20:41:50] <drsooch[m]> yes, alright my build is messed up so I can't debug directly I don't think there is an exact match for what you're describing but I think what pepeiborra was describing is `Person` can be expanded out into `Person String String` and then the user can overwrite the types. I think it's from Wingman (Tactics plugin `UseDataCon`). But I could be wrong

[23:35:12] <pepeiborra> (grepping)
[23:45:39] <salman69e27> @pepeiborra found it in the pragmas plugin. Thank you!
