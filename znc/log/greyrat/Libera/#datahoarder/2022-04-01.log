[03:36:35] <ThePendulum> hm some complaints about build quality on amazon but it feels pretty sturdy to me (kSafe)
[03:37:17] <sarnold> just spend a few minutes on lockpickinglawyer and find the corner of the safe to hit with a mallet and presto you've got your baby back
[03:37:32] <ThePendulum> haha
[03:37:53] <ThePendulum> pretty sure I could pry this open with some trying, but as it says in the description it's mostly a psychological tool
[03:37:58] <ThePendulum> not a security device
[03:38:45] <ThePendulum> interesting they use motors instead of solenoids, wondering if that was a deliberate choice to make it harder to open with a magnet
[03:42:18] <ThePendulum> okay it says if you remove the batteries or they die, it remains locked, which it does... but if you put them back, it doesn't seem to remember the time you set, it just resets to a minute :/ I thought it was supposed to deal with that
[03:42:47] <ThePendulum> oh I think I remember reading it stores the time every 5 minutes, I feel like it should probably do that when it starts counting down as well
[03:43:53] <ThePendulum> ok no I do think it works, it just rounds up or down to the minute as well, if you set it to hours or days it doesn't matter

[03:46:45] <joepie91> huh. this actually sounds like someone actually thought about the design
[03:50:12] <ThePendulum> I looked at some cheap knock-offs but they all had some flaw that would let you in too easily
[03:51:13] <ThePendulum> I was a bit skeptical because it was on shark tank and also pretty expensive, but yeah it seems to do what it says on the tin
[03:51:20] <ThePendulum> whether it helps with habit management remains to be seen
[03:53:11] <ThePendulum> you definitely can't swipe it with a credit card like someone did with a knock-off, the locking nodges are exposed but to push them in I think you'd have to use so much force you might as well smash it
[03:53:53] <ThePendulum> bonus points if they used a worm drive so it's pretty much impossible to spin the motor back
[03:53:58] <ThePendulum> seeing if I can open this thing without breaking it, lol
[03:54:08] <ThePendulum> I mean open the lid when it's off, not take the lid off the base

[04:36:36] <joepie91> these straight bits are the magic
[04:37:00] <joepie91> means you'd be pushing on the locking pins against the wheel at a 90 degree angle so it ain't going anywhere
[04:37:04] <joepie91> it functions as a 'lock'

[04:37:55] <ThePendulum> in fact you can't even snap off those little pins

[04:41:03] <ThePendulum> why so? nothing looks cheaper than it should be
[04:41:53] <ThePendulum> the plastic is thick enough that I doubt it wears out naturally, and if you want to break it intentionally, they instruct you to break the cheaper plastic base
