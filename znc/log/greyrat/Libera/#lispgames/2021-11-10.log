[22:30:54] <dto> greetings peeps
[22:44:51] <Balooga> Good morning?
[22:45:00] <Balooga> It is still that here.
[22:46:01] *** Quits: Inline (~Inline@aftr-37-201-240-235.unity-media.net) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[22:50:41] <dto> 220pm here.
[22:50:44] <dto> how are you Balooga ?
[22:51:26] <Balooga> Well. I just got out of a thing called "Sprint Planning"... Now I'm drinking coffee.
[22:51:29] <Balooga> How are things with you?
[22:51:36] <dto> im good! what is sprint planning?
[22:52:00] <dto> i've got some friends out there who'll be testing Danceball this week. hoping to get some good feedback and bugs!
[22:54:53] <Balooga> If you work in a team that tries to adhere to the "scrum" development practices, everyone gets together to plan when needs to be done in upcoming sprint. 
[22:55:05] <dto> ah. it's something i've heard a little about
[22:55:16] <Balooga> dto: Is CL still your gamedev language of choice?
[22:55:20] <dto> yep.
[22:55:40] <dto> although i'm using a Scheme music thing i wrote for part of this project.
[22:55:49] <Balooga> nice.
[22:56:02] <dto> i'm still using LISPBUILDER-SDL and SDL 1.2 actually. lol
[22:56:12] <dto> i never quite got around to porting to SDL2 and newer GL
[22:56:22] <Balooga> :) Nice!
[22:57:42] <dto> have you seen my new thing/ 
[22:57:50] <dto> https://dto.itch.io/danceball
[22:58:09] <dto> it's quite fun. don't have a mac version yet but maybe soon
[23:03:54] <Balooga> That looks sweet! 
[23:15:03] <dto> :)
[23:36:23] <dto> woops. my mac build procedure is going to break because current MacOS no longer supports 32 bit binaries
[23:36:45] <dto> oh i can fix it
[23:40:50] <Balooga> The SDL 1.2 libraries are all 32-bit.
[23:44:06] <GreaseMonkey> scrum tends to work least terribly when you actually do the prescribed rituals
[23:44:24] <GreaseMonkey> but if you don't do retrospectives, you're basically screwed
[23:51:18] <dto> Balooga: i have the 32 and 64 bit versions of all platforms SDL binaries saved in my repo :) 
[23:52:15] <dto> https://gitlab.com/dto/xelf/-/tree/master/contrib well not the linux ones
[23:53:51] <dto> oops, i don't have the cocoahelper.framework in the 64 bit dir... but i think i can build that
[23:59:14] <dto> is that part of lispbuilder-sdl?
