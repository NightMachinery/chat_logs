[00:00:32] <bookworm> ah right
[00:01:47] <bookworm> but what is not quite correct is that it's a sqlite limitation, it's not 
[00:02:18] <bookworm> it's simply that TL doesn't retry if it gets a EAGAIN from the db
[00:02:30] <bookworm> and then unwinds the stack

[00:07:15] <xnaas> ah
[00:07:19] <xnaas> good to know
[00:07:51] <bookworm> sqlite3 can even handle multiple connections (certainly readers) if you are in a specific mode... however that has drawbacks in regards to data guarantees
[00:07:59] <bookworm> so it's a trade off if you want that or not
[00:08:01] <xnaas> I thought sqlite didn't handle concurrency at all, but my mistake!
[00:08:06] <bookworm> depends on how much data you're willing to loose

[02:09:43] <bookworm> ok, the good news is that I can add a unique id to tables, meaning we enable context during search etc and can jump to messages.
[02:10:20] <bookworm> the bad news is that I need to recreate the table, meaning temporarily have >2x free memory
[02:10:55] <bookworm> considering VPS storage space, that can get ineresting

[02:26:08] <MaxLeiter> can you not re-create it in chunks? 
[02:26:24] * MaxLeiter knows little about sqlite 
[02:26:29] <bookworm> same problem
[02:26:43] <bookworm> in the end you want to end up with a single table
[02:27:01] <bookworm> and generally you want to have this in a single transaction
[02:28:21] <bookworm> we could probably do it in chunks of 100, copy to new, delete old... commit, repeat... but what do you do if it fails in between of a chunk?
[02:28:27] <bookworm> Now your DB is broken
[02:29:02] <bookworm> if you don't commit, well, you need to keep the old stuff as you are still in the transaction so you'll *still* end up with double + of space required

[02:48:29] <bookworm> TOCTOU
[02:49:07] <bookworm> you literally can't know unless you try
[02:49:14] <shadoozo> ah
[02:49:50] <shadoozo> a warning message might also do though?
[02:50:00] <bookworm> I mean, the transaction will simply fail and that's it, the db will roll back
[02:51:24] <bookworm> the problem is a bit that sqlite will not give the storage back to the OS... so if you say have a 20GB VPS, 15GB left and a say 8GB TL DB you fill that up to 20GB, transaction fails with ENOSPC but you can't actually recover as you can't run a vacuum either
[02:52:22] <bookworm> (vacuum in sqlite land makes a new db, copies data over and then releases the old storage blocks)
[02:54:25] <shadoozo> ah... ig you could run it on a different machine but it does make the update process quite a bit harder (unless you just delete it)
[02:56:22] <bookworm> yeah well, can and should probably warn in the release notes then
[02:56:40] <bookworm> not that everyone reads them... auto update docker yolo crowd
[03:00:02] <shadoozo> that + a documentation page on how to recover it and/or update it (from another machine) would suffice I think
[03:00:19] <shadoozo> well that's just kinda their problem :P

[13:46:00] <Activ8> So again how did your friend install the lounge
[13:46:14] <Activ8> Has your friend checked the install location for the logs existence ?
[13:46:26] <Activ8> How do you know you are in private mode?
[13:46:27] <peetee> > so why is it the lounge fault?
[13:46:27] <peetee> > I've had it running 2 years now
[13:46:27] <peetee> > never lost a single log unless I've cleared it manaually
[13:46:27] <peetee> Do you get the message the time when you are disconnected from irc network?

[13:48:25] <peetee> > Has your friend checked the install location for the logs existence ?
[13:48:25] <peetee> Will he have to configure the old logs everytime he run thelounge?
[13:48:34] <peetee> > nope it's not the same
[13:48:34] <peetee> Why?
[13:49:16] <Activ8> your friend needs to check the logs directory inside sounds like maybe it might not have been configured with persistent data, therefore not a lounge problem
[13:49:18] <varayu> My message history also gets lost when the docker container is stopped and started. This doesn't happen with other client such as Convos
[13:49:36] <Activ8> persistent data, docker needs it.
[13:49:55] <varayu> I have mapped the /var/opt/thelounge to my local filesystem, but still
[13:50:10] <peetee> > My message history also gets lost when the docker container is stopped and started. This doesn't happen with other client such as Convos
[13:50:10] <peetee> True true
[13:50:29] <peetee> Developer make thelounge like hexchat
[13:50:33] <Activ8> then your data should be there then, check it

[13:53:52] <Activ8> it saves everything I have had mine running 2 years and all my logs are there regardless of if I restart my server or not
[13:53:59] <Activ8> if I reboot everything is there
