[06:45:49] <jjuran> Today I was expecting to examine a decade-old Mac laptop and maybe purchase it, but the owners just let me have it. :-)
[06:47:36] <jjuran> It was left for me in the first-time setup process, which I will now critique.
[06:48:00] <dmc[m]> I have one of those to refurb but driver support for the GPU is like on life support
[06:48:23] <jjuran> The setup program says nothing about which version of OS X this is.  But the background is linen, so IIRC that's at least 10.7.
[06:49:29] <jjuran> It believes that the US capital city is named "Washington D.C.", so in city/state form it's "Washington D.C., DC".
[06:49:38] <jjuran> That is literally what appears in the time zone list.
[06:50:19] <jjuran> Ah, the "Finishing Up" screen says it
[06:50:24] <jjuran> says it's Lion.

[09:21:17] <Church> Xe: Fiddled with the tide http lib at all?
[09:21:36] <Church> Think I remember you mentioning it.
[10:46:29] <jjuran> 10.7's Java installer says the software is unavailable and I should try again, which turns out to be bad advice:  The second time, it spends forever purportedly "Finding software", which it clearly isn't.
[10:46:40] <jjuran> At least it has a Stop button.
[10:47:15] <jjuran> It even works!
[11:58:41] <epilys> good morning
[12:27:04] <quanticle> jjuran: What OS is it running?
[12:27:20] <quanticle> Oh, Lion
[12:28:02] <quanticle> Is it Intel or PPC?
[12:28:23] <jjuran> 10.6 dropped PPC support
[12:28:32] <jjuran> hardware, that is
[12:28:38] <jjuran> so, Intel
[12:29:43] <quanticle> Ah, right, Snow Leopard was the last PPC MacOS
[12:30:02] <jjuran> Negative, it was the first non-PPC Mac OS X
[12:30:42] <quanticle> Oh, you're right.
[12:30:51] <quanticle> Leopard was the last PPC OSX
[12:31:01] <jjuran> Snow Leopard was the last with Rosetta
[12:31:16] <quanticle> Ah, okay, that explains my confusion
[12:31:25] <quanticle> It was the last one that could run PPC software.
[12:36:18] <jjuran> The 10.7 machine is my only Core i5 that doesn't run half-speed due to no battery, /and/ isn't burdened with running a Web browser.  It's quite nice!

[14:57:33] <jjuran> Wow, Java installed on the third try, though at DSL speed — I wonder if the update server is a VM that had to get paged into memory or unsuspended or even booted up.
[15:11:53] <epilys> waiting for job application replies, waiting for other job to send me their contract, nothing to do meanwhile
[15:11:56] <epilys> suspense is killing me

[20:01:56] <Brekkjern> Man, I am glad I have AC
[20:02:12] <Brekkjern> It's 28C outside, and no wind
[20:02:19] <Brekkjern> It's horrible
[20:03:14] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern cries in norse
[20:04:21] <Brekkjern> Yes :(
[20:06:36] <Brekkjern> It's not so bad in the shade, but having to walk in this sucks
[20:14:19] <epilys> epilys cries in 35C
[20:17:33] * ngoldbaum relaxes in 22C
[20:18:31] * dasm lives in a comfort 57
[20:18:57] <dasm> F... not C (if anyone asks)
[20:19:17] <ngoldbaum> dasm: southern hemisphere?
[20:19:33] <dasm> ngoldbaum: northern. close to an ocean. morning's breeze
[20:19:40] <ngoldbaum> or like maine
[20:19:44] <ngoldbaum> yeah
[20:20:00] <dasm> it's sunny, hot California :D
[20:20:06] <Brekkjern> I'd rather have -10C :S
[20:20:14] <ngoldbaum> ah july gloom
[20:20:52] <ngoldbaum> one time in santa cruz we had a summer school and a bunch of grad students from europe came, none of them packed clothes for cold weather and they all regretted it
[20:20:52] <dasm> my mother-in-law is always asking me about a weather. And for some reason she cannot comprehend that California is not only Hollywood with bunch of asshole^Wcelebs and perfect weather.
[20:21:11] <ngoldbaum> i also enjoyed a swiss grad student try to pay for a bus fare with a $20 bill
[20:21:30] <ngoldbaum> i laughed and gave him a single
[20:21:36] <dasm> ngoldbaum: my mother-in-law, visiting from Europe, decided to check a forecast for February in San Jose.
[20:21:47] <dasm> Unfortunately, she looked up San Jose, Mexico vs. San Jose, CA: )
[20:21:49] <dasm> :)
[20:21:51] <ngoldbaum> lol
[20:22:12] <dasm> so she brought summer dresses, some bathsuit, etc... How dissapointed she was finding out that it wasn't very hot over there ;:D
[20:23:22] <Brekkjern> What's the climate like there?
[20:23:43] <Brekkjern> My gut instinct is "It's fairly far south, so probably not very cold"
[20:24:07] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: the seasons in coastal california are offset by a few months from the normal calendar because the ocean has a lot of thermal inertia
[20:24:21] <ngoldbaum> there’s usually a few weeks in september or october when it gets really hot
[20:24:42] <ngoldbaum> also the ocean off of california is basically always very cold so it’s like an enormous air conditioner
[20:25:37] <ngoldbaum> once you get a few miles from the coast the weather is more what you’d expect
[20:26:01] <Brekkjern>  I was about to say "that sounds chill"
[20:26:18] <Brekkjern> But I bet it's rather hot in the summer months once it gets going?
[20:26:23] <dasm> Plus -- summer mornings are very gloomy, until about noon. Sunny mornings are usually spring and autumn.
[20:26:38] <dasm> Brekkjern: not really. Mornings about 15C, afternoons about 22C
[20:26:56] <Brekkjern> That sounds perfect
[20:26:59] <Brekkjern> I should move
[20:27:01] <dasm> as long as you're staying close to an ocean. If you move inland, let's say Silicon Valley, there could be really hot.
[20:27:12] <Brekkjern> No, fuck that. I want cold
[20:27:41] <dasm> there are other issues tho, like drought in CA
[20:28:04] <Brekkjern> As long as I get to shower every once in a while
[20:28:21] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: UCSC has this beautiful view of monterey bay, in the morning when there’s a temperature inversion and the fog stops at a few hundred feet and the bay is all covered in fog it’s pretty magical
[20:28:34] <ngoldbaum> yeah, also expensive af
[20:28:36] <dasm> ngoldbaum: are you local to SC?
[20:28:38] <Brekkjern> Nice
[20:28:42] <dasm> that ^
[20:29:01] <dasm> if you want to buy something, you need to have about $1.5 mln
[20:29:03] <ngoldbaum> or you live in like bumfuck nowhere near arcata with a bunch of hippies
[20:29:28] <ngoldbaum> dasm: i went to grad school at ucsc and lived there for six years
[20:29:49] <dasm> ngoldbaum: ack. you seem to know the place really good. I just moved there slighty over a year ago
[20:30:02] <ngoldbaum> to santa cruz?
[20:30:06] <dasm> yep
[20:30:16] <dasm> Pleasure Point
[20:30:22] <ngoldbaum> nice, i don’t know what it’s like anymore it’s been since 2015
[20:30:28] <Brekkjern> My apt is 52m2 and in the outskirts of Oslo, and it cost me 2.5 million NOK a few years back. Not sure if I have enough for an apt over there :P
[20:30:33] <ngoldbaum> shopper’s corner is my favorite grocery store ever
[20:30:52] <ngoldbaum> and i really miss tacqueria la cabaña on mission on the westside
[20:31:24] <ngoldbaum> i lived in a studio on top of a garage behind a house on mission like right next to cafe brazil for a few years
[20:32:35] <dasm> Brekkjern: it cannot be compared, tbh. It's not only about a price, There is more to that.
[20:32:58] <Brekkjern> Ofc
[20:33:00] <dasm> ngoldbaum: I'm more of East Cliff.
[20:33:37] <Brekkjern> Pay is much lower in Norway, but I love fairly comfortably with that pay
[20:34:01] <Brekkjern> Live*
[20:39:10] <ngoldbaum> but seriously if you like pork do yourself a favor and get some chicharron tacos from la cabaña
[20:39:42] <ngoldbaum> unless it’s no longer good or covid killed it
[20:39:53] <ngoldbaum> in which case sad
[20:40:59] <dasm> seems to be still around

[23:05:29] <Brekkjern> I'm convinced

[23:08:07] <Brekkjern> I got a feeling that the plurality of the users on Lobste.rs were young in the early 80's and they are all nostalgic for their youth :P
