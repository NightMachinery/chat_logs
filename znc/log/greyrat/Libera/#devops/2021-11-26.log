[01:51:05] <rawtaz> do you know Go btw?
[01:51:13] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am in Europe, so my political association changes depending on which TV news I am watching :)
[01:51:16] <kwilczynski> I do.
[01:51:27] <rawtaz> lol right
[01:51:30] * kwilczynski always wanted to get the original vinyl Gopher
[01:51:37] <rawtaz> hm can you get a pic of that?
[01:51:45] <rawtaz> i mean is that not the one you linked to above?

[01:54:07] <rawtaz> oooh right
[01:54:19] <rawtaz> that one is pretty cute
[01:54:25] <rawtaz> seems a bit more practical
[01:54:34] <rawtaz> but the plush one is more strangleable when you have coding problems
[01:54:38] <kwilczynski> I need to land and on-site Google interview.
[01:54:43] <kwilczynski> So I can go to the gist shop ;]
[01:54:44] <rawtaz> you can strangle it like homer does with bart in simpsons
[01:54:46] <kwilczynski> :P
[01:54:48] <rawtaz> yeah

[01:58:33] <rawtaz> i like it :3
[01:58:40] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: So. I will adopt you, and then I can put you into my testament.
[01:58:50] <kwilczynski> So you will get my plush one once I kick the bucket.
[01:58:52] <kwilczynski> BUT!
[01:59:02] <kwilczynski> It would be then a haunted item.
[01:59:05] <kwilczynski> :>
[01:59:07] <rawtaz> that's a fair deal
[01:59:14] <kwilczynski> OK.
[01:59:16] <rawtaz> who cares, as long as i get the plush
[01:59:41] <kwilczynski> Ahh, fine then, I will be a good kind of poltergeist.

[22:12:46] <lantech19446> rawtaz: to be honest i'm not sure, they allow you to make plugins so it might be
[22:32:31] <lantech19446> rawtaz: apparently they were thinking about making it open source last year but it never has been done and a lot of people seem to have fought for it to stay closed which makes no sense to me
[22:39:02] <rawtaz> ok
[23:15:19] <lantech19446> hey I'm compiling a list of things that the devops positions around here are looking for, but i'm confused about where to classify ansible, kubernetes things like that. Should they be in cloud or just network tools?
[23:20:10] <rawtaz> ansible == deployment tools and to some extent CD perhaps
[23:20:21] <rawtaz> kubernetes is cloudy sure
[23:21:01] <lantech19446> ok cool
[23:21:27] <rawtaz> i presume you have seen/know about roadmap.sh
[23:23:44] <lantech19446> yes and while it's good in some aspects there's things on the devops roadmap that even people in devops have disagreed with like go being the language of choice for example. I don't quite feel like I'm reinventing the wheel though because this is stuff that's true to my area where I live

[23:27:04] *** Joins: aphelion7 (aphelion@user/aphelion)
[23:28:05] <rawtaz> of course. you cant blindly trust *any* resource out there, it's all about gathering info then making your own assessment of it
[23:30:12] <lantech19446> rawtaz: the problem i find is that most people just starting out don't have any clue what to believe or not believe and I've yet to find a resource that breaks it down like you need to know this for entry level this for junior this for senior it makes it seem like you need every piece of the puzzle from the getgo
[23:30:59] <rawtaz> thats when you gather info from X sources, make sure you understand it, apply your own judgement and complement that with a lot of statistics to determine which key parts of that big pile of advice is the relevant ones
[23:31:04] <rawtaz> are*
[23:33:14] <rawtaz> lantech19446: just dont overanalyze and spend time on that stuff too much. just start learning something
[23:34:47] <lantech19446> right now i'm learning javascript, I plan to learn node next I'm having some trouble learning this but i figure it'll open up a few things to me i can do webdev or devops with it
[23:35:05] <rawtaz> i dont think theres much use for js in devops, what would that be?
[23:35:13] <rawtaz> potentially some with AWS but meh
[23:35:25] <lantech19446> i was thinking node which is still js
[23:35:27] <rawtaz> python is probably much more useful in devops settings
[23:35:35] <rawtaz> yes but who cares about node in a devops context
[23:36:14] <rawtaz> js and node is for web and related development, thats for sure. but it's not something you learn for devops needs
[23:36:42] <lantech19446> that was one of the suggestions on roadmap.sh lol nodejs is all server side so when they said node I figured it might hold some water
[23:37:35] <rawtaz> sure. i'd say python is much more relevant for automation though
[23:37:46] <rawtaz> but as roadmap says, the key is to get programming understanding
[23:38:12] <lantech19446> ok adding it to my list, I have a personal subscription on udemy so all this stuff is obtainable
[23:40:05] <rawtaz> it's rather unrealistic to land a devops job after trying to learn it basically from scratch in one year to be honest.
[23:41:34] <lantech19446> I have 13yrs of experience in networking so it's not exactly from scratch I'd be relying on my experience plus some gained skills
[23:44:19] <rawtaz> i hear you. its still pretty unrealistic to expect a proper devops job though, since oyu need experience. but it might be possible to get a job somewhere that they are moving into devops and arent expecting someone who has done it and know it, but instead need someone who researches it in relation to their needs and moves things in the devops direction for them
[23:44:24] <rawtaz> basically ci/cd
[23:49:27] <rawtaz> i think that maybe just going for kubernetes is a pretty safe thing to do, but at the same time knowing kubernetes isnt of much use if one doesnt have real experience with it and one dont get that until one starts owrking with it in real business instead of a learning setting
[23:49:51] <lantech19446> it's so weird to me to hear people saying that here because before I got the idea that it might be fun to learn it I've known several people who knew shit from shinola and got jobs in devops making 100,000+ a year I don't understand how they're doing it
[23:50:38] <lantech19446> well I guess it's a good thing I run a network then, just gotta find some way to justify its use
[23:51:11] <rawtaz> yeah that background is very good to have
[23:51:22] <rawtaz> i think its a loooot about just finding the right job :)
[23:55:36] <lantech19446> I gotta make up my mind on what i really want to do whether it's devops or programming, I gotta say the ability to freelance and work remotely is really enticing especially in this job market where there's not as many options as there used to be but working in the kind of network that's getting closer to cutting edge might be pretty exhilarating too
[23:58:13] <rawtaz> yeah, i think thats key, choosing a path
[23:58:35] <rawtaz> noodle around in job ads and see which ones seem interesting and not requiring X years of experience with that specific thing
