[00:59:30] <BerenErchamion> Is there another way to get superuser status to run that command besides using "sudo"?
[00:59:58] <TomyWork> (in slightly more complicated terms, the shell evaluates the ">>" and tries to open local.conf to append. that hits the write protection before the sudo is even ran)
[01:00:17] <TomyWork> BerenErchamion, you could do "sudo -i" to get a root shell
[01:00:29] <TomyWork> or you use the "sudo tee" trick
[01:00:41] <Gustavo6046> plus, supporting all of the things is probably a good thing

[01:00:51] <Gustavo6046> I mean Linux supporting PE not the other way around, oops
[01:01:05] <TomyWork> oh you meant PE as in windows binaries
[01:01:11] <Gustavo6046> no, just the binary format
[01:01:15] <BerenErchamion> How about this:  $  sudo -i echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
[01:01:15] <Gustavo6046> not Windows binaries themselves
[01:01:16] <TomyWork> no, linux binaries are usually ELF
[01:01:16] <akoana> BerenErchamion: sudo bash -c "echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf"
[01:01:23] <Gustavo6046> yeah but can they be PE?
[01:01:27] <nomagno> Or you can run a script that does that as sudo
[01:01:32] <Gustavo6046> like Linux relocs etc in PE
[01:01:39] <TomyWork> Gustavo6046, not that i know, no
[01:01:43] <Gustavo6046> aw :<
[01:02:10] <TomyWork> you can have wine register an binfmt to be able to run windows executables directly, if that's what you're looking for

[01:02:25] <devcpu> green
[01:02:39] <Gustavo6046> just regular, (almost) perfectly normal Linux binaries, but encoded in Portable Executable format
[01:02:44] <TomyWork> Gustavo6046, yeah there are no linux PE binaries. would be a useless feature
[01:02:54] <BerenErchamion> How about:  $  echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
[01:03:24] <TomyWork> BerenErchamion, yep, that's the "sudo tee" trick i mentioned earlier
[01:03:33] <akoana> well, if you don't mind output to your terminal too

[01:06:21] <BerenErchamion> I like to see positive evidence that something worked and is running
[01:06:32] <TomyWork> nomagno, but if you want to use it as a conditional in a script, probably should replace it by an "if"
[01:06:39] <rascul> BerenErchamion sometimes you can add -v to get some output
[01:06:40] <TomyWork> if command1; then command2; fi

[02:01:00] <naptastic> I learned the hard way recently that /etc/network/interfaces is parsed with that regex, so commenting something off the end of the line doesn't remove it from the config. The system just ignores the # since there's no such network device, and keeps parsing the rest of the line.

[02:19:34] <naptastic> jim, tbh I'm not sure what parses it. But the parser that turns it into a working configuration, and the parser that highlights it in Vim, don't quite behave the same way. That's... it just happens that way sometimes. I code perl; you learn to work around it.

[04:21:09] <farkaan> It's a 3 line file
[04:21:23] <p`> you probably want to "grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi"
[04:21:28] <farkaan> Three .efi files
[04:21:39] <p`> which will install grub again, but to be used through uefi, instead of via bios
[04:21:39] <farkaan> bootx64.efi  fbx64.efi  mmx64.efi in boot

[04:21:55] <farkaan> I think that's what whoever installed the ubuntu did

[04:35:10] <keir> depends
[04:35:17] <keir> might have been a BIOS install

[04:37:21] <keir> that's something else
[04:37:34] <rascul> or what Namarrgon said
[04:38:07] <p`> i mean you could still boot things in bios mode, but in a dual boot both-from-same-disk scenario like this.  i mean i guess you technically could, but you'd have to clear/rewrite the boot sector whenever you wanted to switch

[09:53:39] <purpux> how does $* and $@ work ? just putting `echo $*` in a script and passing arguments like so `script arg1 arg2`, outputs nothing. But, if it is in a function, like so `func (){ echo $* }` and I call that function: `func arg1 arg2`. It works. Does $* and $@ work only for functions ? Can I not use it outside of functions ?

[13:02:02] <tfisgnag> Hello. I am having problems with my storage devices and I must shutdown my computer. Before doing that I can only use an out of the box flash drive to rescue the data I have gathered in these last working hours. The box says it is a  SanDisk Cruzer Blade fat32 that is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8,  Windows 10 and macOS v10.9+. Do these
[13:02:03] <tfisgnag> features of the flash drive add an extra risk to the rescue procedure I am about to perform.  ?
[13:02:32] <xiaomiao> unlikely
[13:02:32] <[twisti]> im reading commands like 'vgcreate tecmint_vg /dev/sda1'; what does tectmint_vg mean/do ? i cant find anything on it

[17:58:21] <baltazar> hi! i have a bit of a stupid problem. I'm running linux (arch) on a nanopi neo. Seemingly its ethernet interface doesn't have a mac address set inside it, so I guess it just picks one at random on every boot. Since an update, there's something that sets the mac address based on machine-id (I assume, maybe something else on the SD card). this is almost usable, but it means that the mac is tied to the SD,
[17:58:27] <baltazar> not the device, so it will change after a reinstall and it would get transferred if I change SDs.

[17:59:32] <baltazar> now, I wrote a small c program that sets the mac address based on the cpu's serial number, and added the udev rule `ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", RUN+="/usr/bin/serial2mac $name"`, which works as I'd expect.

[22:01:51] <vtimofei> Ok so :ro is used in docker-compose.yaml at  least that's where I am using it to mount config files, and system root certificates for docker containers. And it is used to mark a volume or file read only.
