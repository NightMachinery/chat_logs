[00:59:02] <diverdude> hi, i have a docker container running a java program in tomcat. To run this program i need to increase heap space. I do this by adding ENV CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Xms512m -Xmx4096m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m" to the Dockerfile. The problem is that if i add that line, the docker container just exits without any reason why. Is that because all memory is being used?:

[01:52:55] <queeq> Hi. Do I understand correctly that the standard way to set volume size is using driver options' "size" parameter? If so, is there a way to change it after creation? And if not, is there another method to set size quota that could be changed later?
[02:09:39] <zoredache> diverdude: do you have any memory limits applied to the container?
[02:11:43] <zoredache> queeq: what filesystem are you using for your volumes? Only some support quotas.  If they were zfs backed, you could probably adjust the quota using the zfs command line after creation.
[02:12:16] <queeq> I use XFS. Chose it because it supports quotas
[02:13:38] <zoredache> worst case is you could create a new volume with the correct quota, start a tmp container with the new and old volumes mounted in, and use rsync or something to transfer things to volume with the correct volume.
[02:16:43] <queeq> Yes, I can sometimes do that, unless there's not enough space on disk
[02:17:20] <queeq> E.g. when there's a big volume that occupies, say, half of all the available space and then needs to be extended.
[02:18:33] <zoredache> anyway, I am not sure of any way to change the quota of existing volumes. You could probably change it with xfs_quota, since you are using xfs

[12:15:23] <diverdude> hi. i have a docker compose file which spins up 2 images. When i run it on my machine w. 126G memory it all runs great and docker stat reveals that one image uses 4.5G and the other 1G. If i then try to use that same docker compose file to spin up those 2 images on my MBpro w. 16G memory the process using 4.5G gets killed by docker even though i only use around 8G of data before spinning up the images. 
[12:15:29] <diverdude> So why does docker kill that container when there is still memory left on the device

[18:18:28] <DevAntoine> Hello
[18:18:51] <DevAntoine> I was using the experimental version of Docker for Mac until no such version exist anymore.
[18:19:10] <DevAntoine> So my experimental version got updated to the one and only docker for mac existing right now.
[18:19:35] <DevAntoine> In Docker Engine's json configuration I just noticed that "experimental" is set to false.
[18:20:16] <DevAntoine> So, I got automatically disabled experimental mode when updating docker for mac a few months back?
[18:21:09] <DevAntoine> Last time I switched from the stable to experimental version I lost every image/container.

[18:25:51] <realies> I've asked the person with the issue for their version of docker, and the screenshots I got show a different looking UI altogether 
[18:26:03] <ada_> realies: did you build the image for arm or for x86?
[18:26:40] <realies> it takes ubuntu:latest, creates my-img:baseline, then another compose service takes my-img:baseline and creates my-img:processor, and this is where it fails on arm
[18:26:46] <realies> let me get you the full log
[18:26:58] <ada_> I guess I'm trying to say, the architecture is part of the image manifest, so if you built the image for <arch-1> but tried to run it on <arch-2> then it wouldn't be the same image and thats why I think you see the hit to docker.io since its trying to look up the manifest
[18:27:54] <realies> the only pull that happens for these dockerfiles is for ubuntu:latest, pretty sure it pulls the arm variant, why would it attempt to switch the arch later down the image creation?

[20:00:12] <DevAntoine> But it doesn't seem to work.
[20:00:15] <DevAntoine> Is that even doable?

[20:11:28] <ada_> show your compose file
[20:11:35] *** Joins: maret (~textual@193.37.255.237)
[20:11:45] <ada_> and can you explain what "doesn't work" means?
[20:12:02] <ada_> you have this profile file, you expect <something> to happen, but <something else> happens instead?
[20:12:51] <DevAntoine> ada_: well, this profile file sources another file.
[20:13:10] <DevAntoine> If I do "source ~/.profile" my other file is well sourced.
[20:13:27] <DevAntoine> But when the container is ready I can tell the file wasn't loaded because the env vars are missing.
[20:14:14] <DevAntoine> ada_: compose file is quite simple: https://gist.github.com/devantoine/8b5cf32a5aebf468192a5b36773d3627
[20:14:20] <ada_> I think .profile is only loaded on interactive logins
[20:14:22] *** Joins: hposca (~hposca@node-1w7jr9phoke2uuevlzoqmsdks.ipv6.telus.net)
[20:14:31] <ada_> so, by default, bash would not load .profile if the shell was invoked non-interactively
[20:15:24] <ada_> I think you may want to add your changes to /etc/profile instead
[20:15:31] <ada_> actually
[20:16:09] *** Quits: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[20:16:15] <DevAntoine> ada_: by default docker allocates a tty regarding docker-compose exec --help
[20:16:15] *** Quits: weedmic (~weedmic@89-139-109-7.bb.netvision.net.il) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[20:16:25] <ada_> /etc/profile also gets loaded on interactive logins - ultimately, the goal is to take some env vars from a file on your host and make sure they're set in the container?
[20:16:31] <ada_> docker-compose exec isn't the same as docker-compose run
[20:16:44] <ada_> I mean, docker run's invocation relies on the command, but docker exec works differently
[20:16:47] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[20:16:50] <ada_> especially if you invoke bash with a tty
[20:16:51] <DevAntoine> ada_: yeah that's the ultimate goal, load env vars from a .env file at shell startup
[20:17:04] <DevAntoine> using "docker-compose exec" not "docker-compose run"
[20:17:10] <ada_> well exec is a different problem
[20:17:22] <ada_> ok lemme see here
[20:17:52] <ada_> so ostensibly, .profile is set, and you docker exec, which creates a shell interactively, but you don't get .profile loaded
[20:18:15] <DevAntoine> that's right
[20:22:01] <ada_> DevAntoine: when you 'docker exec' are you doing it as www-data?
[20:22:06] <DevAntoine> yes
[20:22:23] <DevAntoine> (whoami checked)
[20:24:21] <zamba> is there a way i can make sure that volumes are not overwritten by some other container?
[20:24:27] <zamba> i'm using docker compose
[20:24:43] <zamba> i believe i've encounted a situation before where the volume for a project was just overridden without warning
[20:24:46] <programmerq> you can set :ro on the container you don't want to write to it.
[20:25:01] *** Joins: sudomann_ (~sudomann@c-73-133-131-19.hsd1.md.comcast.net)
[20:25:06] <programmerq> otherwise, you could run different numeric uid/gid in the containers and use regular filesystem permissions
[20:25:10] <zamba> well, i want to write to it.. but i don't want a random docker-compose command to simply overwrite it
[20:25:31] *** Joins: momomo (~momomo@user/momomo)
[20:25:32] <DevAntoine> ada_: I just tried moving the file to /etc/profile.d (the file is right there after next startup) but I still don't have the env vars avaialble oO
[20:25:48] <programmerq> docker-compose itself doesn't write contents to volumes, so I'm not sure what situation you're trying to solve for.
[20:26:35] <zamba> "CreatedAt": "2020-04-21T11:39:13Z",
[20:26:45] <zamba> that would be updated if it was overwritten somehow, right?
[20:27:26] <ada_> zamba: created at isn't the same thing as overwritten
[20:27:33] <ada_> a volume that exists cannot be "overwritten" without being deleted
[20:27:43] <ada_> you can try to 'dockver volume create' the same volume name twice
[20:27:44] <ada_> it won't work
[20:28:22] <zamba> that's basically what i'm asking.. so a volume that already exists and would be recreated by a different docker-compose command, wouldn't be allowed to continue because the volume already exists, right?
[20:28:59] <ada_> if you referred to a volume that was already created, it would get mounted by your container
[20:29:08] <zamba> if i had two docker-compose files, both with the same project name.. and the same volume defined.. first come, first create
[20:29:21] <ada_> correct, and on the second it would simply get used because it already exists
[20:29:25] <zamba> gotcha
[20:29:32] <zamba> thanks :)
[20:29:56] <zamba> that was a bit of convoluted question, but i'm lacking words :)
[20:30:01] <ada_> there are a lot of them
[20:30:42] <ada_> can be hard to choose the right ones XD

[21:34:16] <Nothing4You> is there any way to chown a folder in a container with docker-compose before running the main entrypoint other than having to build an entire build pipeline to build a custom image?
[21:34:58] <ada_> Nothing4You: compose doesn't have much to do with it
[21:35:33] <ada_> Nothing4You: suffice it to say, no, you would need to either set the ownership bits on those files from the host or else run some kind of command/script inside the container to set the right bits on those files before the actual process starts
[21:35:44] <Nothing4You> ok
[21:35:54] <Nothing4You> permissions in containers are really awful :(
[21:36:06] <ada_> you could run the contianer as the user that owns the files
[21:36:11] <ada_> docker run --user 1000:1000 ...

[21:36:19] <Nothing4You> except that i don't want to share uids on the system
[21:37:07] <ada_> you could use whatever uid you wanted, it doesn't have to be 1000
[21:37:25] <ada_> your solutions are 1) set the ownership bits on the files to the UID of the user in the container or 2) run the container as the UID of the user that owns the files
[21:37:28] <Nothing4You> the problem is that the container requires a specific uid from upstream
[21:37:58] <Nothing4You> so more or less my only option would be to set up a build pipeline to build custom images with different uid

[21:52:43] <Nothing4You> akik: except that would run with a user that doesn't have permissions, so unless i init as root and then drop i can't do that either
[21:54:19] <akik> i thought the entrypoint script runs as root?
[21:54:34] <Nothing4You> not if you pass --user
[21:54:44] <akik> right
[21:54:49] <Nothing4You> many containers are designed to run the entrypoint as root and have it drop provileges
[21:55:04] <Nothing4You> and also chown in the entrypoint script
