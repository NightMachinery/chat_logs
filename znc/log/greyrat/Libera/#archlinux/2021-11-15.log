[00:55:59] <teraflops> for me ha-proxy is enough
[00:56:30] <mikebutash> if they want to blow their load on some F5 appliances, they're not horrible things, just horrible on the wallet.
[00:56:44] <teraflops> pricey indeed
[00:57:31] <mikebutash> they bought nginx to try to upsell them to "premium" F5 features, or at least paid support contracts on nginx.
[00:57:45] <teraflops> yeah I was intereted in that topic

[07:32:28] <AmR> mpan: Thanks :)
[07:32:44] <rcf> While true, there should *not* be entirely separate-but-identical AUR repos for them. 
[07:33:51] <mpan> rcf: I am not entirely sure if PKGBUILDs are the same. With bootstrapping one of the early-stage versions may have some dependencies removed. I believe that is an accepted practice: see, as an example, gcc bootstrapping PKGBUILDs.
[07:33:55] <mpan> gcc and libc
[07:34:30] <mpan> But I am not in position of authority in this case.
[07:36:09] <rcf> I suppose there is a slight usability advantage here, but only because selectively building split packages is impossible.

[10:25:05] <predicament> .. i dont wanna fuck it up, the wiki has me confused.
[10:25:19] <amosbird> ayekat: yeah, dunst supports that. I wonder if there is a way for other notifications like telegram-desktop
[10:25:20] <bookworm> what does a username have to do with it?
[10:25:39] <ayekat> amosbird: you can have telegram use native notifications
[10:25:42] <predicament> unless that's just a Manjaro thing, i saw something on there about needing a new username for each DE
[10:25:43] <bookworm> telegram can use the normal notification system

[10:25:54] <karrq> no you don't need new usernames for each DE

[11:07:54] <krin> Honestly most of the pain in brtfs I’ve seen is the subvolumes and swap files. LUKS on LVM with swap, brtfs root, and brtfs home partitions works well enough.

[11:35:15] <Gagis> sunyibo, anaconda is the industry standard for data science and related use, so if you have interest in that direction, its a good idea
[11:35:26] <bookworm> anaconda is a pre packaged set of scientific python modules, it totals to like 3 GB of atuff you'll never need
[11:35:39] <Gagis> installing jupyter inside anaconda environment is the usual way
[11:35:58] <bookworm> eh, no
[11:36:20] <bookworm> the point of anaconda is that you don't install anything, it all comes bundled
[11:37:07] <bookworm> you can use envs... but then you are better of with miniconda that just gives you the package manager, not that conda is very good mind you
[11:37:21] <Gagis> that was my workflow when I did data stuff. miniconda with project-spesific environment definitions and managed trough jupyter notebook
[11:37:42] <Gagis> huh, I though anaconda had just a bit of defaults over miniconda, not literally everything

[13:05:22] <frojnd> Uh Tom^ thank you let me try that
[13:05:28] <Tom^> so comment it out
[13:05:43] <Tom^> oh pipewire
[13:05:49] <Tom^> hm well, pulseaudio has that atleast
[13:05:49] <frojnd> Uh yeah
[13:06:06] <frojnd> Will switch back to pulseaudio if that's the only way to use my headphones
[13:06:33] <frojnd> But I lowed that noise canceling feature with pipewire worked better than with pulse
[13:06:53] <Tom^> maybe pipewire has something similiar

[13:08:00] <Tom^> jelle: yeah idk
[13:09:08] <Tom^> havent been able to fiddle with pipewire yet. last time i tried when i logged into my user. all outputs. laptop speaker and headphone went into 150% volume with static noise playing

[18:57:59] <gloomy> Hey, I like to have htop running in the background (i3 scratchpad, doesn't matter) so I can bring it up quickly with a key shortcut. Currently I have a systemd user service that starts a konsole session with non-root htop in it. It would be practical if I could do the same with a root session (that way I can renice and kill processes).  I'm a bit insecure about the security implications... thoughts? 
[19:00:20] <gloomy> The computer is reachable by ssh (with a separate password), would the presence of a always-running root shell pose any kind of risk (I mean, if someone manages to get ssh access I basically screwed already, right?)

[23:41:19] <Namarrgon> it's not
[23:41:24] <concrete-houses> It is recommended to explicitly format the aligned partitions with sector (also named cluster, blocks, depending on the file system) of the same size of the physical sector size, otherwise blocks will be written in other size (usually 512 bytes) and the firmware will still have to do the mapping of many file system sectors to one physical drive sector. While this is usually and transparently 
[23:41:30] <concrete-houses> done by the translation layer, it is an overhead that can be avoided and doing so will achieve an increased performance.
