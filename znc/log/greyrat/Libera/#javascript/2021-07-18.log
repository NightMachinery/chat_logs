Writing his future wife, Coretta Scott, during the first summer of their relationship, he told her that he was “more

[18:19:01] <teut>  Line 22:19:  React Hook "useStyles" is called in function "mainContent" that is neither a React function component nor a custom React Hook function. React component names must start with an uppercase letter  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks

[18:20:13] <theskillwithin> wow sir you are a mouth full
[18:20:24] <teut> hmm
[18:20:35] <teut> https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html
[18:20:38] <teut> this right?

[18:21:07] <silly> teut is jss already working in other components?
[18:21:09] <stenno> ashnur: no
[18:21:23] <teut> yes it worked in app.js
[18:21:39] <Alexendoo> teut: It's not about hooks exactly, it's that you can't use a component like <mainContent>, it has to be <MainContent>. You might be importing it elsewhere with a capital at the start though
[18:21:42] <teut> I dragged some code to a separate file
[18:21:46] <ashnur> stenno, especially the sense-making series he did with "the stoa" is great, lots of good questions and good answers
[18:21:54] <ashnur> teut, yeah, so?
[18:21:56] <teut> and I copied  useStyles too
[18:22:03] <silly> weird
[18:22:04] <spike_spiegel> teut try to import React at the top of your component ?
[18:22:12] <teut> oh ok
[18:22:26] <spike_spiegel> i don't know if it's the answer
[18:22:35] <silly> oh this again, i've heard it wasn't necessary anymore...
[18:22:36] <ashnur> it's not the answer :)
[18:22:42] <spike_spiegel> ok my bad
[18:22:52] <theskillwithin> after react 17 its not
[18:23:05] <silly> although my thing didn't compile without importing React...
[18:23:07] <ashnur> teut, you have to use hooks in function components, not just any function call, you are calling that function not as a component somehow, outside of react
[18:23:08] <teut> import {MainContent } from './components/main'
[18:23:18] <teut> I m using this import in app.js
[18:23:23] <ashnur> ok

[18:24:45] <stenno> great anime indeed, without question
[18:24:49] <teut> the rule was in case of single export you can just use any name to import it
[18:24:54] <theskillwithin> beep boop
[18:25:13] <ashnur> teut, it's not the import, it's how you use it, and because you are one of those people who like to rush and not step back and take some hammock time to think about what they are doing, i am going to stop telling you what your problem is, you will figure it out
[18:25:36] <silly> ti's working already

[18:34:12] <spike_spiegel> teut, you can replace "<MainContent></MainContent>" by "<MainContent />"
[18:34:41] <spike_spiegel> because you don't put anything in your component
[18:35:45] <spike_spiegel> also Alexendoo, renaming the function MainComponent won't do anything because with a default export, when you import it like teut did, you can name it whatever your want
[18:36:05] <ashnur> teut, you are rushing because you don't know react?
[18:36:13] <Alexendoo> spike_spiegel: It's not a runtime error. It is a linter error. The lint rule doesn't know you import it differently elsewhere

[19:11:28] <spike_spiegel> you can configure prettier to format according to the rules inside your eslint config
[19:11:40] <spike_spiegel> and the prettier default are pretty good
[19:12:16] <ljharb> spike_spiegel: yes it does, and formatting is what linters do
[19:12:28] <ljharb> eslint has had autofix for almost it’s entire existence
[19:12:35] <ljharb> and you can use prettier, just via eslint
[19:12:38] <ljharb> never use it by itself tho.
[19:12:39] <spike_spiegel> no, linter only tell you "this code is wrong"
[19:12:51] <ljharb> spike_spiegel: you’re blatantly and objectively wrong here
[19:13:04] <ljharb> some lint rules indeed can’t be autofixed. But that’s fine.
[19:13:12] <spike_spiegel> default prettier rules are used in react, jest and storybook code
[19:13:35] <spike_spiegel> no i'm not wrong, eslint goal isn't to format your code but only to tell your if your code is good or not
[19:13:48] <ljharb> spike_spiegel: you are wrong. Eslint has autofix.

[21:34:39] <GreenJello> onosendi, I'm only half awake, but the code is a bit hard to follow because of naming (e.g. notNullFields should be nonNullIds), and the hierarchy is weird (should be e.g. item_1_price) and you could split the keys into { category: 'item', id: 1, field: 'price' } kind of objects to make it clearer in what the logic is

[22:52:21] <GreenJello> yeah
[22:52:25] <Donitz> good
[22:53:35] <GreenJello> you can pretty safely assume that anything that's pure JS (no HTML/CSS/DOM stuff) is the same everywhere, since it's entirely formally specified
[22:53:54] <stenno> err
[22:54:14] <stenno> is that really true?
[22:54:32] <jacekowski> CSS and HTML is entirelly formally specified
[22:54:35] <Donitz> well, if it's not consistent, it would cause a very serious bug
[22:54:38] <GreenJello> except for features missing from comparing old versions of engines to recent versions

[22:54:52] <stenno> i am talking about sorting algorithms and lookup algorithms
[22:54:58] <pulse> there's bound to be some inconsistencies between the major JS engines
[22:55:04] <Donitz> that is true

[23:31:27] <jellobot> (okay) 23
[23:31:28] <wille> there's ameme for that
[23:31:30] <hmw[at]> n> 100 + '2'
[23:31:31] <jellobot> (okay) '1002'

[23:31:40] <stenno> its called implicit typecasting
[23:31:47] <stenno> its a feature of almost any higher language
[23:31:58] <hmw[at]> Voodoo.
[23:32:19] <hmw[at]> Now we need linters to make sure, we don't use it
[23:32:43] <stenno> a linter cannot guarantee this without a type system

[23:32:59] <stenno> those things are decided by runtime and cannot always be checked by static code analysis
[23:34:01] <stenno> hmw[at]: the concept of truthiness as you know it from many languages is already implicit typecasting
[23:34:09] <stenno> you can see this in Java where this doesn't happen
[23:34:28] <stenno> if (foo) { ... } // will throw error in Java unless foo is of type boolean
[23:34:45] <hmw[at]> Sane.
[23:34:59] <stenno> sure, you can argue about the benefits of a strict type system
[23:35:27] <stenno> wille: "100" + 2 in C is probably "102"
[23:35:37] <stenno> or "300"
[23:35:38] <wille> Nope
[23:35:46] * stenno tests
[23:36:17] <stenno> i guess it would increase the pointer address
[23:36:24] <Donitz> I wonder if there are any physics frameworks which rely on strict types
[23:36:25] <wille> "100" is a const char and points to text section of your executable, so it's a pointer. Might be something like 0x392be271
[23:36:34] <Donitz> such as a meter type, and a force type, and a mass tpye
[23:36:36] <Donitz> type*
[23:36:49] <stenno> so if you have char* foo = "foo"; char* bla = foo + 2;
[23:36:55] <stenno> bla will be "o"; right?

[23:37:33] <wille> Bla is still a pointer. But if you fetch the data behind bla, yes, it's "o" :)
[23:37:44] <stenno> sure, fair
[23:38:34] <stenno> there is a simple solution to avoid problems with implicit typecasting in JS: dont do it
[23:38:49] <stenno> don't add a number to a string
[23:38:55] <stenno> why would you want to do that anyway
