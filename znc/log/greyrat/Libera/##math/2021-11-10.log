[02:25:36] <johnkeats7> yes it isn't easy. iirc it all relies on the topological version of h-cobordism in dim 4 and the proof of that involves those infinite handles and it's extremely involved. i remember a thread on MO where a guy was complaining that by now all these old experts on topological manifolds are dead and nobody really understands the argument anymore and they have no reason to believe it's correct

[02:31:58] <johnkeats7> mycroftiv, i don't think it's productive to scour physics looking for applications of the sub-sub-field of math one is interested in. just go and learn physics and you'll have a more honest and complete understanding of what's useful and what isn't

[03:55:05] <somiaj> You could try element chasing proofs, A = B if A subset B and B subset A.
[03:55:16] <somiaj> Though one way to prove a set is empty is assume it is not and come to a contradiction

[03:55:41] <ysftaha> oh sorry, I have to prove this using set algebra
[03:55:43] <somiaj> the other option is use various distributive rules of union/intersection and demorgans' law

[10:56:57] <W> Can you say that the space of a circle (S^1) is Euclidean? Or is there another term, something like "locally Euclidean" or similar?
[10:58:21] <W> To clarify, I'm wondering if the fact of wrapping around, and having multiple straight lines between points changes the terminology
[10:58:23] <Batzy> W: not really
[10:58:44] <greenbagels> greenbagels wonder if qergle use of third person part of covert plan to make channel speak in third person
[10:58:51] <Franciman> W: locally euclidean means that each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open set of R
[10:59:20] <Franciman> (actually R^n, for some n)
[10:59:26] <Batzy> W: when you say a space is euclidean, you're usually endowing it with some sort of vector space structure
[10:59:27] <Franciman> which is actually the case for S^1

[11:01:35] <Batzy> that's locally flat, sure

[11:04:06] <greenbagels> i should try to get back into reading DG
[11:05:28] <W> so, on to my real question, is there something like a torus that is flat (or some approximation of it?), while also not being square (nor rectangular etc) in the sense of not having distinguishable directions where antipodal points can be reached by shortest distance (i.e. four directions for a square torus, two for a rectangular)? Or what is the impossibility of this called (where/under what name might I find a proof)?
[11:05:31] <Batzy> W you can actually almost identify R and S^1

[11:10:20] <W> e.g. the surface of a sphere works, but that space is very un-flat, triangle angles don't sum right etc

[12:48:46] <rindolf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation
[12:48:56] <riv> I just remembered that O(M+N) = O(max(M,N))
[12:49:12] <riv> because big O only cares about the biggest one
[12:49:16] <int-e> it follows from max(N,M) <= N+M <= 2max(N+M)
[12:49:31] <riv> if M is bigger then O(M+N) = O(2M) = O(M)
[12:51:48] <W> okay, my earlier question comes down to this; no matter what 2-manifold you have, if you can draw a straight line between a point P and P a diameter away in any direction, then you can make a biangle at any angle a, and you can cut that biangle in two triangles with another straight line, and the sum of interior angles in the two triangles is then a full circle plus 2a. Basically, Euclid himself covered this.

[15:46:46] <Z-module> They don't want you to, you can't really in general. But the real point is that p does not divide that order, because |HT/T| = |HT|/p^a  and p^a is the largest power of p dividing |G|
[15:47:12] <Z-module> remember that T is some particular p-Sylow
[15:47:54] <Z-module> I left out: no higher power of p can divide |HT| because HT is a subgroup of G
[15:48:29] <cadmio> |T| = p^a right? now what allows you to write |HT/T| = |HT|/|T| ?
[15:48:37] <Z-module> See my first remark
[15:48:51] <Z-module> which is *totally* general, for any finite group at all, any normal subgroup
[15:49:03] <Z-module> HT is a finite group, and T is a normal subgruop of it
[15:53:58] <cadmio> why is the text citing the first isomorphism theorem if I don't need that?
[15:54:01] <Z-module> It's the thing I said yesterday about how for any subgroup B of any group K, the set {all left cosets of B in K} partitions the set K into equal-sized subsets, each of size |B|.  So if K is finite, then  |K| = |B|*(the # of distinct left cosets of B).     That thing in parens is just what |K/B| means if B is normal (so that K/B is a meaningful group).
[15:55:29] <Z-module> Maybe they number it differently than others. 1st *should* be: If  f:G -> H  is any group homomorphism, then ker(f) is normal in G, and  G/ker(f) =~ im(f)
[15:55:42] <cherim> First isomorphism theorem in that text  is HT/T ≃ H/H ∩ T. You also discussed this yesterday.
[15:55:50] <Z-module> most people call that the 2nd
[15:55:53] <Z-module> but whatever
[15:56:03] <cherim> The above is "fundamental homomorphism theorem"
[15:59:04] <Z-module> Oh cool,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems  spells out the different names/numberings by the main authors; I'd never seen this before.
[15:59:20] <cadmio> sure but I thought I had to use that relation to calculate the cardinality |HT/T|
[16:00:31] <Z-module> you can't really calculate it in general
[16:00:39] <Z-module> but it's certainly |HT|/|T|
[16:00:42] <Z-module> which is very basic
[16:01:12] <Z-module> using the partition-by-same-size-sets things that I mentioned
[16:02:18] <Z-module> the isomorphism theorem they are using (I guess they call it 1st) says that the two group HT/T,  H/(H cap T)  are isomorphic groups, so in particular they have the same size.

[16:42:05] <biberao> how so?
[16:42:19] <biberao> i was going to do a similar process like this
[16:42:28] <biberao> log_3(x(1+1/x))/x then log_3 x * log_3(1+1/x)

[19:37:47] <Z-module> cadmio, the only things you need are:  HT is a subgroup of G containing T, so its order is  p^a k  for some k coprime to p, and so the order of HT/T is  |HT|/|T| = p^a k / p^a = k
[19:38:08] <Z-module> you don't know what k is, but it's coprime to p, which is the important point
[19:39:26] <cadmio> you give for understood |HT/T| = |HT|/|T|
[19:39:33] <Z-module> (it could be 1, which is iff HT = T, which is possible)
[19:41:08] <Z-module> |HT/T| = |HT|/|T|  is the stuff I talked about earlier, the K/B situation, where the set of all left cosets of B forms a partition of the set K, each thing in the partition having size |B|
[19:41:09] <cadmio> that's a quotient group it is treated like a simple literal expression that you simplify
[19:41:18] <Z-module> you don't "simplify" HT/T
[19:41:30] <Z-module> it's just a quotient of a finite group (the group HT here)
[19:41:38] <Z-module> so it consists of all left cosets of T in HT
[19:41:42] <Z-module> and each of them has size |T|

[20:33:20] <greenbagels> say each set is disjoint but let's say they're all well-ordered; do you need choice to say "the cartesian product of S_i contains (min(S_1), min(S_2), min(S_3), ...) ?

[23:04:06] * qergle gets popcorn and jolly rogers
[23:04:48] <Teofrastus> I really want to learn set theory, proofing concepts and all that stuff but I kinda don't know where to begin. The reference books/sources people suggest are either too rigorous (for a mathematician) or too soft (for a philosopher). Is there a solid but easy-to-understand reference out there? I am an engineering student, BTW.
[23:05:14] <fltrz> I knew N, NxN, NxNxN, ..., Z, ZxZ, ZxZxZ, ... Q, QxQ, QxQxQ, ... were all countable, but I don't think theres a bijection between R and R^2, nor (0,1) <-> (0,1)^2
[23:05:17] <qergle> or maybe i mean jolly rancher.
[23:05:20] <[itchyjunk]> too rigorous for a mathematician?
[23:05:29] <qergle> fltrz: yes, R to R^2 can be done
[23:05:37] <Teofrastus> No it is too rigorous for me, it is *for a mathematician* .
[23:05:39] <Franciman> qergle: can I get some pop corn?
[23:05:59] <[itchyjunk]> fltrz, you take a square, square if defined by pair of number (0.abc.. , 0.def)
[23:06:00] <qergle> you can have some poop corn
[23:06:05] <Franciman> ~~
[23:06:11] <[itchyjunk]> then you created a (0.adbecf...) thingy
[23:06:16] <[itchyjunk]> is how my prof just did it
[23:06:20] <fltrz> qergle: but the map is not differentiable?
[23:06:35] <Franciman> Teofrastus: do you speak italian?
[23:06:35] <qergle> now you're adding more conditions
[23:06:40] <Franciman> [it's relevant to your question]
[23:06:55] <Franciman> I have an algebra book with a lengthy introduction to naive set theory
[23:07:00] <Franciman> I think it would be a good start
[23:07:05] <Teofrastus> Oh, no sorry I only know English. But thanks so much
[23:07:13] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: mapping between decimal expansions doesn't sound rigorous, 1 = 0.99999999999999999....
[23:07:21] <Franciman> imho, you had better time finding a book that gets you started on proofs
[23:07:26] <Franciman> like an algebra book
[23:07:32] <Franciman> and they usually cover some set theory too
[23:07:36] <Franciman> from there you go to more formal set theory
[23:07:40] <Teofrastus> Currently I follow Keith Devlin's book and I liked it but I wanted to consult the experts :)
[23:07:44] <Franciman> but nobody uses super formal seth theory
[23:08:02] <Franciman> that's usually something only logicians study
[23:08:05] <Teofrastus> So I'll look for an algebra book. But I suppose as a mathematician, you refer to "modern algebra" right?
[23:08:06] <[itchyjunk]> fltrz, dedikind said something about all real number can be represented as 0.abc...
[23:08:10] <[itchyjunk]> so you can do this proof
[23:08:11] <Franciman> you just use the right amount of formalism you need
[23:08:15] <Franciman> to avoid paradoxes
[23:08:21] <qergle> fltrz: now why don't you prove it in front of the class?
[23:08:29] <fltrz> how does the bijection between R and R^2 cope with dedekind cuts?
[23:08:43] <Z-module> for every positive integer m > 1,  R and R^m do have a bijection, but not a continuous one either direction.

[23:15:44] <[itchyjunk]> bijection is rigor i think
[23:16:02] <[itchyjunk]> if you can construct it, you can claim the cardinality is that same
[23:16:22] <[itchyjunk]> at least that's the only def i know of. are there other definition to claim cardinality of 2 sets is the same?
[23:16:27] <[itchyjunk]> one that doesn't invovled bijection?
[23:16:54] <fltrz> doesn't bijection require the concept of identity in both sets to be defined? how can you count number elements mapped if you can't say if 2 elements are identical or not?
[23:17:30] <[itchyjunk]> identity?
[23:17:42] <[itchyjunk]> {a} {b}
[23:17:43] <fltrz> without an identity relation, the concept of bijection seems moot?
[23:17:45] <Z-module> a bijection is nothing but a function that is both injective and surjective
[23:17:45] <[itchyjunk]> a != b
[23:17:50] <Z-module> there's nothing else
[23:17:53] <[itchyjunk]> but there is a bijection between {a} and {b}
[23:18:32] <[itchyjunk]> or i can write a bijection between {a} and {b} i should say.. i think
[23:18:40] <qergle> identity?
[23:18:42] <[itchyjunk]> are there non constructable bijections? @_@

[23:19:25] <[itchyjunk]> like we just discovered it
[23:20:03] <riv> fltrz: it's a recursive definition
[23:20:20] <riv> two sets are equal if the elements are equal
[23:20:31] <riv> and this gets you down to the sets one level lower
[23:20:36] <riv> until you get down to empty sets
[23:20:45] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: yes, for all positive integers m, n, there are addition-preserving bijections R^m -> R^n, but only if you use something non-constructive in the case m != n.
[23:20:48] <riv> then it holds vacuously, two empty sets are equal without any problem
[23:21:20] <fltrz> but how can one prove or disprove injective and surjactive without an identity relation? suppose Alice claims x^2 is a bijection over Q, then if Bob disproves it by saying 2/1 and 4/2 both map to 4, that disproof would be wrong, since 2/1 == 4/2. But if he shows -2 and +2 both map to 4 it would correctly disprove what Alice said

[23:25:14] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: so would you say 0.5[0]* and 0.4[9]* are identical numbers or not?
[23:25:19] <[itchyjunk]> A = {a,b} and B = {1,2} let. f:A->B, f(a)=1, f(b)=2. here, i say f is a bijective function from A to B
[23:25:38] <fltrz> if not, then you are not considering a segment of the real number line
[23:25:41] <[itchyjunk]> fltrz, probably not
[23:25:47] <[itchyjunk]> but dedikinda cut involves limit
[23:25:51] <[itchyjunk]> not just sequences

[23:26:17] <[itchyjunk]> 0.9999999 != 1 but a sequence 0.9,0.99,.. has a limit 1
[23:26:21] <[itchyjunk]> i think that's how it went

[23:27:19] <[itchyjunk]> was it lim? or was it sup{0.9,0.99,0.999,...} = 1 ?
[23:27:38] <fltrz> riv: hung up on what? 0.[9]* = 1.0 in my opinion, but not if we are to believe the (0.abc..., 0.ABC...) <-> (0.aAbBcC...0) bijection. I prefer to believe 0.999... = 1.0 over that "bijection"
[23:27:42] <qergle> who do i blame about this decayed topic?
[23:28:00] <[itchyjunk]> bijection doesn't mean equality of elements
[23:28:30] <[itchyjunk]> A = {a,b}, B = {1,2}, f:A->B can have more than one bijections
[23:29:08] <[itchyjunk]> you keep saying "if we are to believe the (0.abc..., 0.ABC...) <-> (0.aAbBcC...0) bijection"
[23:29:10] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: I'm not talking about equality between an element from the 1D set with another from the 2D set. I mean that equality within the 2D set, and equality within the 1D set should be respected by bijection
[23:29:14] <[itchyjunk]> as if someone is saying they are equal

[23:33:23] <riv> hi
[23:33:46] <greenbagels> what's even the question here?
[23:33:52] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: is f: x |-> x*x a bijection? for x element of Q
[23:33:53] <[itchyjunk]> no it's not, because -p/q and p/q gets mapped to the same thing
[23:34:47] <mandanguita> In R^d, if x is a vector of R^d, with norms ||x||_2 := sqrt(sum(|x_n|^2)) and ||x||_inf := max(|x_n|) R^d, I need to show that ||x||_inf <= ||x||_2 <= sqrt(d)*||x||_inf
[23:34:49] <greenbagels> also because the function doesn't isn't surjective
[23:34:54] <mandanguita> I don't know how to even start
[23:34:58] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: is f: x |-> x+1 a bijection over Q?
[23:35:10] <greenbagels> mandanguita: so you're showing these norms are equivalent?
[23:35:41] <riv> mandanguita: I suppose we can start by showing sqrt(sum(|x_n|^2)) <= max(|x_n|)
[23:35:42] <greenbagels> oh even more specific than equivalent
[23:35:43] <[itchyjunk]> greenbagels, i mentioned a bijection between (0,1) -> (0,1)x(0,1) that was constructed by representing a squar as pair of (0.abc...,0.ABC) numbers
[23:35:53] <somiaj> mandanguita: well try something pick of of the two inequalities (hint ||x||_2 <= sqrt(d) ||x||_max I think is the easier of the two)
[23:36:02] <[itchyjunk]> then maping (0.aAbB..) from (0,1) to that tuple
[23:36:08] <riv> mandanguita: equivalent to sum(|x_n|^2) <= max(|x_n|)^2
[23:36:21] <mandanguita> intuitively I would say that the max of a vector is just the greatest number in the coordinates, and from here prove that a number is less than a sqrt of a sum of more numbers...
[23:36:42] <riv> mandanguita: now consider the vector (1,2).. LHS: 1^2 + 2^2 = 5,   RHS: 2^2 = 4
[23:36:45] <riv> the inequality seems false
[23:37:04] <fltrz> [itchyjunk]: I agree the first one is not a bijection, but your reason is incorrect. the increment function (I should have called it g to avoid the name clash) IS a bijection, despite p/q and (2p)/(2q) mapping to the same (p+q)/q
[23:37:16] <somiaj> riv: You may have flipped yourself around, it is true
[23:37:20] <[itchyjunk]> huh?
[23:37:29] <greenbagels> riv: it's definitely true
[23:37:38] <[itchyjunk]> it noe being surjective is not correct reason?
[23:37:55] <[itchyjunk]> i think a function not being surjective is a perfectly valid reason to say it's not bijective
[23:38:00] <qergle> mandanguita: did you prove the first part, ie infinity-norm ≤ 2-norm?
[23:38:10] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: for clarification, you said it wasn't injective, i said it wasn't surjective
[23:38:13] <mandanguita> somiaj: the problem is that I'm trying to prove it "algebraically" but max is not "algebraically"-friendly

[23:38:52] <somiaj> mandanguita: in this case it is really friendly
[23:38:54] <fltrz> that is not the problem, the problem is that you ignore the role of the identity relation when not working with canonical representations. sure you can model real numbers with a list of decimals, but such models need consideration of an identity relation

[23:44:28] <mandanguita> qergle: I'm on it
[23:45:36] <greenbagels> fltrz: perhaps why it's so hard to imagine there being a bijection between R and R^2 is that by necessity such functions cannot be continuous
[23:45:46] <somiaj> cherim: no, because you can complete the square to get a(x - b/(2a))^2 + (rational), so just take any two rationals on equal distance of either side of the vertex b/(2a) to get the non-injective part for Q too
[23:46:31] <somiaj> opps I have a sign error, but the idea is the same
[23:46:32] <cherim> Two rationals can't be at equal distances from b/(2a) since then b/(2a) is itself rational
[23:46:55] <cherim> Doesn't happen for generic a, b often
[23:47:16] <somiaj>  "integer polynomial functions" was part of the condition
[23:47:45] <somiaj> note if a,b,c are irrational, then you may not even have a function Q->Q

[23:49:55] <fltrz> greenbagels: at first I thought my offense came from differentiability, then continuity, but now I consider the affront more fundamental: if both x1 = x2, y1 = y2 then I insist (at least normatively) that bijective f maps x,y pairs to the equivalent points: z1=f(x1,y1) = f(x2,y2)=z2; if not I don't consider it a bijection.
