[12:12:09] <Cl0udSanta> James Webb Space Telescope
[12:12:22] <Activ8> I had a horrible fucking dream last night awakening loop with sleep paralysis
[12:12:27] <Activ8> twice it happened
[12:12:59] <Activ8> Scary as fuck I looped about 10-15 times
[12:14:40] <Cl0udSanta> I've never had sleep paralysis. I had a lot of really wild sleep walking incidents when I was younger. outside of that I've had wild ultra realistic dreams that were almost too real
[12:14:58] <Hunterkll> ugh
[12:15:03] <Hunterkll> sleep paralysis is the fucking worst
[12:15:08] <Activ8> It’s worse when you get them together having 1 is bad enough
[12:15:19] <Cl0udSanta> JWST launch scheduled for 7:20 a.m. Eastern (12:20 UTC)
[12:15:22] <Activ8> i thought I was dead for a moment and couldn’t wake up out of the dream
[12:15:24] <Hunterkll> had one where I was running from a demon next to a cop and we got roasted with fire .... came through and felt like i ws burning lol
[12:15:46] <Cl0udSanta> were you recently watching silent hill?? lol
[12:15:48] <Hunterkll> though usually just falling from a top level of a bunk bed or the room caving in on myself is what i get when it happens
[12:15:55] <Hunterkll> Cl0udSanta: actually, i've never seen silent hill
[12:15:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:15:59] <Activ8> my second dream I was running around and the ground fell and I kept falling n falling n falling 
[12:16:03] <Activ8> never seen it
[12:16:07] <Cl0udSanta> dont bother, its pretty shit lol
[12:16:18] <Hunterkll> but yea, i find the best way to deal with it is just to power through it and force yourself to move somehow
[12:16:27] <Hunterkll> usually breaks it pretty quickly - if you realize what's happening anyway
[12:16:52] <Activ8> I eventually woke up confused as fuck n was shaking for no reason 
[12:17:09] <Hunterkll> the worst is like
[12:17:15] <Hunterkll> when you're trying to scream and don't know what's happening
[12:17:16] <Hunterkll> but can't 
[12:17:19] <Hunterkll> because you can't move 
[12:17:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:17:22] <Activ8> I’ve had that before
[12:17:31] <Hunterkll> almost like you're suffocating
[12:17:47] <Cl0udSanta> I've had a number of wild dreams. the most wild was me flying through space, without a suit or ship. and I saw this huge civilization, wanted to look and investigate, but the gravity caused me to shoot through space at almost light speed. and some huge being grabbed me and said 'you do not belong here' and threw me back to earth. I woke up as I started entering the atmosphere
[12:18:05] <Activ8> i kept dreaming I was re-crossing my arms n moving them into different positions because I was trying to sleep but I wasn’t doing that in real life I know I wasn’t it was in the dream
[12:18:07] <Hunterkll> oh man
[12:18:13] <Hunterkll> i had a wicked one recently - just a dream but damn
[12:18:36] <Hunterkll> basically, all flights were cancelled, TV and internet were shut down, and riot police were gassing and rounding up everyone for processing
[12:18:53] <Hunterkll> ..... get into the hotel they're using for processing and there's a giant picture of Kim Jong Un hanging up on the wall 
[12:18:55] <Cl0udSanta> sounds like the movie Chariot lol
[12:18:56] <Hunterkll> North Korea had taken over
[12:18:58] <Activ8> Some dreams are nice but recently I seemed to have bad ones
[12:19:19] <Cl0udSanta> dreams are wild af.
[12:19:29] <Hunterkll> riot cop who caught me was nice tho, he's like "sorry dude but we got a new boss"

[12:23:01] <Cl0udSanta> this is the first time in 20 years I've watched a christmas movie, or tried to get into the chistmas spirit

[12:55:18] <Cl0udSanta> you know the worst thing about most xmas movies, it involves either abandonment of a kid, or the parents being total dick bags in one way or another.
[12:59:10] <Cl0udSanta> Jingle All the Way, parent bein dickbag. Home Alone, parent bein dick bag, also abandonment. Christmas Vacation, parent bein dick bag.
[12:59:22] <Activ8> Because it makes you the ink of a cruel world
[12:59:28] <Activ8> its to make you go awwwwww
[13:00:18] <Cl0udSanta> pf. not in my book. I got dropped off by my birth dad christmas day with the words 'I dont want to deal with him anymore'.
[13:02:56] <Activ8> That’s the definition of the stoke story 
[13:03:21] <Activ8> Stork*
[13:04:52] <Cl0udSanta> tbh, this is the first Ive intentionally watched any kind of holiday movie in the last 30+ years. Its certainly not helped my mentality any, but I'm doin better than previous years.
[13:08:49] <Activ8> Yeh I think sometimes you just have to grow the towel in n do something you wouldn’t normally do
[13:12:20] <Cl0udSanta> eh, I grew up in a single family home, and then was homeless for a long time without much help. I've given a fair bit to some various people just in the name of being generous. I've had some pretty terrible years since I was 6-8, I'm barely startin to make myself a hole person
[13:14:24] <Cl0udSanta> also tfw you realize 80's-90's airport security wasnt even close to post 9/11 security. 'oh yea i'll totally let you board with my ticket.. totally safe'

[13:25:09] <Hunterkll> best christmas ornament ever
[13:29:07] <DrZak> mmm
[13:29:09] <DrZak> that is indeed
[13:32:31] <Activ8> Cl0udSanta I meant do something out the ordinary.  You said it was the first time you watched a Christmas movie in ages.  I left home when I was 16 wasn’t homeless but close to it
[13:35:34] <Cl0udSanta> for what its worth, I was homeless from 22-25. everything I have now I've gotten for myself. its hard to feel generious or christmas-y when the shit you've been through most people cant even imagine.
[13:39:31] <Activ8> I understand
[13:41:08] <Activ8> I lost everything in redundancy, couldn’t find a job in few months so had to sell up, pay off debt and move back with family.  I have the basics now.  And now I understand how easy it is to lose everything in blink of an eye
[13:42:06] <Activ8> I do t trust the system I asked for help all over and nobody would help.  Banks, loans etc all because of 3 missed mortgage payments
[13:42:12] <Activ8> don’t
[13:43:25] <Activ8> They say there’s help out there but they not interested if they think they won’t make money off you you won’t give you a penny so the systems a big failure.  There’s loads of people losing houses now in the UK because of covid and been kicked out of rented properties.
[13:43:41] <Activ8> Personally I don’t think next year will be great for a lot of people
[13:44:47] <Cl0udSanta> you'd probably shit bricks if I told my life story. suffice to say, parents were shit and the ultimate result of my life. I've gotten better over the years, but even watching some of the most basic holiday movies make me feel fuckin down or worse

[13:46:20] <Activ8> Yeh,  horrible to know that happens I guess there’s only 1 person that can change things
[13:48:08] <Cl0udSanta> literally, my birth dad dropped me on my moms door step christmas day and said 'you take him, I dont want to deal with him anymore', when I was 8 or so. every xmas after that was basically a sham, or some bribery from one parent or the other. parents when I was in my teens was sad and disappointing, I'd really have rather just time traveled around xmas time for more or less most of my life
[13:49:39] <Activ8> Sorry to hear that, only 1 person can change things though 
[13:50:36] <Cl0udSanta> yep. I've done better than most years, but its still a deep scar I cant avoid
[13:51:29] <Activ8> Understandable 
[13:53:13] <Activ8> I see things in a different way now I’m a lot more sensible and less wreck less than I used to be.  
[13:53:42] <Activ8> Getting credit while been young was stupid, a lot of material things I should have never ever purchased

[14:03:48] <Activ8> i was fucked over big time

[14:04:41] <DrZak> you was just unfortunate, not fucked over big time, is cool! things arent that bad!
[14:04:44] <DrZak> no panik
[14:05:25] <Activ8> Around my place a lot of tech roles are now either part time to fill I for covid leave or the companies don’t want to recruit full time and what they are doing is getting 2 part time members

[14:07:47] <Activ8> I work part time I don’t have the outgoing bills for full time so I’m taking a break
[14:07:57] <Activ8> I was out of work for a year
[14:08:04] <DrZak> ouhc
[14:08:13] <DrZak> well that is kinda more sucky 
[14:08:30] <DrZak> one would like a breather for a few months or a year

[14:09:07] <DrZak> a mate of mine works 4hrs a week in it and the rest on his small farm
[14:09:24] <DrZak> works like 9 hrs a day in diversified work, so it doesnt get tediou and he gets by
[14:09:38] <Activ8> I have always dreamt to own a lake and run fishing clubs but that’s very expensive
[14:09:53] <DrZak> some chicken, goats, veggies, basically works only for non-food items
[14:10:32] <DrZak> yea, but you might just buy a trailer with fishing things and park it at a lake while you relax, sell the occasional thing
[14:10:40] <DrZak> its like a small version of a club
[14:10:42] <DrZak> :]
[14:10:46] <DrZak> except there's no loo
[14:10:53] <Activ8> Can’t do that you have to own a lake first lol

[14:11:47] <DrZak> ooh

[14:12:25] <DrZak> no public stuff
[14:12:26] <DrZak> got it
[14:15:29] <DrZak> that unreal engine tools are pretty amazing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCOhes1Zgg
[14:15:48] <DrZak> like creating a 3d barn out of few hundreads pictures
[14:16:21] <Activ8> Unreal Engine 5 is amazing but can’t imaging what hardware you will need to run that shit
[14:17:18] <estranger> half the coolness is how easy it is to make assets for the engine... if it runs on consoles shouldn't be too crazy for PCs?
[14:17:55] <Activ8> A lot more cost to get a compatible PC than a console
[14:18:14] <Activ8> i would never ever buy a top end PC or console now 
[14:18:20] <Activ8> the games are far too expensive
[14:19:11] <estranger> I just need more time, else I'd go for a ps5
[14:19:45] <Activ8> I would never buy a console the games are far to expensive
[14:21:37] <DrZak> its bloody amazing
[14:24:49] <Activ8> In the grand scheme of things it’s not.  Every year prices are been pushed up further and further on every item you own.  Isn’t getting cheaper.
[14:25:44] <DrZak> yea
[14:27:39] <Activ8> The next problems is energy.  To power these PCs and consoles someone needs to pay the energy bills to run these devices

[14:33:07] <estranger> I built this house in 2020
[14:33:19] <estranger> spray in foam, uv windows, etc
[14:33:26] <estranger> led everything
[14:33:46] <DrZak> is it a real house, or america cardboard sandwitch miracle of instability
[14:33:49] <DrZak> :D
[14:34:11] <estranger> it's made of sticks :) I'm moving already though ha
[14:34:17] <Activ8> A brand new combo boiler, new kitchen appliances and a shower instead of a bath.  This house I’m in grandparents have just spent 15k renewing the whole lot.  That isn’t going to be saved on bills for at least 5-7 years lol
[14:34:18] <DrZak> o.0
[14:34:26] <DrZak> so a survival shelter in the woods
[14:34:37] <DrZak> :]
[14:34:45] <Activ8> you have to spend money to save money so where’s the logic in that.  The only difference is everything is brand new.
[14:34:48] <DrZak> its not a house until its made out of 15 cm reinforced concrete
[14:34:48] <estranger> naa I got  a wind fall... looking for our "dream" home
[14:34:57] <Activ8> false economy lol
[14:35:05] <DrZak> :)
[14:35:20] <estranger> I seem to moved houses more often than people move cars
[14:35:23] <DrZak> i plan on building a house i can die in, so it should last 30-40 years
[14:35:39] <DrZak> mostly without maintenance
[14:36:08] <Activ8> We have double bricks on our house with breeze blocks inside
[14:36:19] <Activ8> Moving houses can get expensive

[14:38:21] <estranger> wife wants a range Rover, so that sets my next car budget lol

[14:44:20] <estranger> I'd opt out if possible, I'd feel wrong
[14:44:45] <Activ8> You don’t have a choice if you poor
[14:44:50] <estranger> right
[14:44:57] <Activ8> if you in London working 120 hours a week ya fine
[14:45:13] <Activ8> or a London scammer
[14:45:16] <estranger> like I got a child covid check, wtf.. I donated it
[14:45:31] <estranger> give it to people that need it
[14:45:43] <Activ8>  Yeh Ofc makes complete sense
[14:45:59] <DrZak> the funny thing is - if there was a website - like - support your bum
[14:46:16] <DrZak> and ppl would pick a person and send htem like 10 bucks a month
[14:46:27] <Activ8> Our food banks have increased as well 
[14:46:27] <DrZak> it would completely supplant any kind of support system the state has
[14:46:36] <DrZak> and save billions
[14:46:46] <DrZak> bt then a lot of govt employees would end up bums
[14:46:47] <DrZak> :))
[14:46:57] <Activ8> indeed
[14:47:16] <Activ8> our government are a joke especially the MPS they are creaming the system
[14:47:25] <DrZak> i mean, say there are 0,5% of bums, 99,5% ppl sending them a 10 a month would be huge
[14:47:39] <Activ8> They could do that I agree with you
[14:47:44] <DrZak> costs of the system would be negligible
[14:47:46] <Activ8> but that isn’t going to happen

[19:52:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> t 12.5 hours is the first real issue
[19:52:36] <sd> 11<H​otmess> thats for when the telesope is operational
[19:52:44] <estranger> I mean, I feel like it will all be fine
[19:52:46] <sd> 11<H​otmess> while its not in operation the sheild isnt imporant
[19:53:04] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like i said it gets to l2 everything else is fixable
[19:53:20] <sd> 11<H​otmess> preferably with comms and power generation active
[19:53:41] <estranger> anything non physical
[19:54:06] <estranger> send up Bruce Willis
[19:54:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly anything pyhsical is easier if the computer is working
[19:54:30] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as they can get an actual printout of whats wrong that way and do a detailed correction plan
[19:54:50] <estranger> better just work :p
[19:54:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> rather than just send up every tool needed to replace the entire sattalite
[19:55:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly thats what we all hope for
[19:55:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> t+5 is where the transit shilds are withdrawn
[19:55:20] <sd> 11<H​otmess> after that its the sensitive stuff thats exposed
[19:55:36] <sd> 11<H​otmess> till then its largly a lump of hard to damage metal 😉
[19:55:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> <https://www.inverse.com/science/whats-the-roadmap-for-james-webb-telescope-now>
[19:58:47] <estranger> nice link, and damn... a month to get to l2
[19:59:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah
[19:59:15] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its not hard to get to L2
[19:59:20] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its hard to get to L2 and stop
[19:59:46] <estranger> ha yeah
[19:59:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lagrangianpointsanimated.gif
[20:00:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> L2 is 1.5 million km from earth
[20:03:50] <estranger> since it will have to do course corrections... what's the lifespan of it?
[20:04:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> once its in l2 its there for about a billion years
[20:04:38] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honestly solar pressure will be a bigger issue and its behind earth so that should be minimal
[20:04:56] <estranger> that should be long enough
[20:05:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> mission duration si expected to be 5.5 to 10 years
[20:05:17] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but so was hubble and thats still going
[20:05:33] <estranger> Webb's mission lifetime after launch is designed to be at least 5-1/2 years, and could last longer than 10 years. The lifetime is limited by the amount of fuel used for maintaining the orbit
[20:06:00] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah and hoenstly we could go up there and give it more fuel
[20:06:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> they use flyweels for aiming
[20:06:47] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so chaging its attiatue is basicaly limited to power and the health of the flyweels
[20:07:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which thanks to hubble and other sattalies we actually learnt a shit load about
[20:07:33] <sd> 11<H​otmess> zero K welding being the big thing we learnt from them. james webb should be immune to that problem
