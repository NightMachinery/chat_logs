[02:27:08] <Joanna> Hello hololeap welcome to channel
[02:27:42] <hololeap> hi
[02:28:17] <ilikeyou> yes holiday today
[02:28:21] <ilikeyou> Columbus Day
[02:29:07] <Joanna> Oh yea I forgot:)
[02:31:00] <inky_> Joanna, to me the story is not about never expressing or shardng, but about using at luast own servers.
[02:31:04] <inky_> least
[02:31:12] <inky_> not trusting third parties
[02:31:21] <inky_> however cool they want to look
[02:31:56] <inky_> i have my mail server, my friend has his mail server. we host our servers at our flats.
[02:31:56] <Joanna> Even first parties are often untrustworthy:)
[02:32:15] <inky_> but muuuuuuuch more trustworthy
[02:32:30] <Joanna> I do like the idea of not using a third party server.
[02:32:30] <inky_> my email goes from my nerver to his server
[02:32:41] <inky_> doesnt even get out of armenia network
[02:33:09] <inky_> there are many places to search for vulnerabilities
[02:33:23] <inky_> but level of control in our case uncomparable
[02:33:38] <inky_> we did not trust some protonmail or something.
[02:33:45] <inky_> we own the machines
[02:33:56] <Joanna> Can the traffic be intercepted though?
[02:33:57] <inky_> we built the binaries from sources.
[02:34:22] <inky_> i told u, there are always places to search for vulnerabilities
[02:34:29] <inky_> and no, i do not believe
[02:34:39] <Joanna> If I had a server I think I would want it on my own machine also.
[02:34:43] <inky_> someone has a tecdology to decrypt our traffic
[02:34:51] <inky_> mathematically it is very hard
[02:35:02] <inky_> like impossible.
[02:35:18] <inky_> wy hardware, located at my place.
[02:36:03] <inky_> also i don't claim 100% security
[02:36:25] <inky_> i claim that this model, if done with some level of decent literacy
[02:36:26] <Joanna> If you’re hosted obviously whomever hosts you can get into the data and share it with whomever they like
[02:36:32] <inky_> is much safer
[02:36:37] <inky_> uncomparably safer
[02:36:48] <inky_> than relying on somene's else servers
[02:36:51] <hololeap> inky_: you live in armenia?
[02:37:15] <inky_> well they often promise to not do that
[02:37:21] <inky_> yep
[02:37:49] <Joanna> Of course they promise.. talk is cheap
[02:37:49] <hololeap> I was just curious
[02:38:05] <inky_> no problem. not a secret.
[02:38:26] <Joanna> All the biggest snitches “care about your privacy “
[02:38:53] <inky_> i am pretty open person actually and i write about myself and express opinions publicly and under my nawe.
[02:38:53] <inky_> name
[02:39:05] <inky_> i had my name as username on freenode
[02:39:40] <inky_> just decided it's cooler like this when i became 43 or something like that.
[02:40:25] <Joanna> If I had a server in my home I would turn it off when sleeping and limit who can connect. Yes I know people can use vpns but still..
[02:40:57] <inky_> yeah, many people do, it depends on what are you limiting
[02:41:13] <inky_> many people don't allow ssh connections from the world
[02:41:14] <Joanna> People who have servers in their homes often have endless hacking attempts.
[02:41:24] <inky_> but from the couple of ips only.
[02:41:35] <Joanna> Do you have your friends whitelisted .?
[02:41:51] <inky_> no, ssh access is for me only.
[02:42:13] <inky_> but they use wy jabber, email and fediverse services.
[02:42:59] <Joanna> One way to cut down on hacking attempts would be to limit connections
[02:45:51] <hololeap> I was thinking about switching to self hosting my jabber at home to save on costs
[02:46:16] <hololeap> right now I use a vps out on the web somewhere

[02:52:13] <Joanna> hololeap: as long as you don’t have much traffic
[02:52:29] <Joanna> Hi linext_ welcome
[02:52:37] <linext_> hello
[02:53:03] <linext_> is there a short description about what this room is for?
[02:53:41] <linext_> personal security, like not clicking suspicious email links?
[02:54:47] <Hydragyrum> read the first bit of the topic
[02:55:23] <linext_> hmmm
[02:55:33] <linext_> i don't get the difference between this and #security
[02:57:20] <inky_> hololeap, i encourage to do so. the problems are that not many providers
[02:57:36] <inky_> give u real static ip
[02:57:48] <inky_> for home cotvnnection
[02:58:13] <inky_> also many limit outgoing traffic.
[02:59:23] <Hydragyrum> linext_, there really isn't much besides that #security hasn't been the greatest lately (re: ops doing stuff worthy of a ban and top-level ops kinda just not doing anything about it *cough* apachez)
[02:59:45] <Hydragyrum> also re: a bunch of off-topic stuff and personal attacks going on there
[03:01:21] <elkclone> werd
[03:02:01] <Joanna> It seems like several people have just taken over the channel with the permission of the ops

[09:42:00] <HaMsTeRs> Thx Joanna.  :)   I added this channel to auto-join.   Hope we could share some updates on latest security news and threads.
[09:42:13] <Joanna> :)
[09:43:43] <Joanna> There was this posted by its earlier https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/apple-releases-urgent-iphone-and-ipad.html
[09:44:01] <Joanna> I don’t remember if you were online then
[09:46:56] <HaMsTeRs> Thanks for re-sharing.  I guest you are right, I've missed it.  :D
[09:47:47] <Joanna> I can’t stay online all the time either so I miss stuff but that’s ok this channel isn’t just for me :)
[09:48:26] <HaMsTeRs> atm, I'm downloading the patch :D
[09:51:32] <Joanna> Sometimes I wonder if new patches don’t have new problems though..
[09:53:15] <Joanna> In fact I can’t think of a faster way to make problems with code than making improvements
[09:53:47] <lts> I'd argue installing iOS security patches ASAP is one of the more important opsec things an iPhone user should do
[09:54:37] <Joanna> Well sure but the new code could also have vulnerabilities:)
[09:56:03] <Joanna> The code that is vulnerable now was once considered perfect.
[09:56:40] <Joanna> Maybe it will take a while for the vulnerabilities in the new code to be found :)

[14:39:45] <Joanna> I once saw an avatar in an online game named mnemon . Probably wasn’t you though :)
[14:44:01] <mnemon> could be, I've used it in some
[14:44:26] <mnemon> which game?
[14:47:51] <mooff> no :)
[14:48:26] <mooff> this is a new creation. i am nobody. but i went through the mid-late 2000s era of web and (limited) desktop programming
[14:48:56] <mooff> a big part of it was irc. and i'm enjoying talking crap again :-)
[14:49:35] <mooff> i can't see any other channels we share, Joanna. but for #security 
[14:49:43] <mooff> is that where you saw me? i don't believe i've posted there
[14:52:59] <mooff> i ran a small web game for a while around 2008. it had around 250k registered users, on the order of 1k-20k active each month at its height
[14:53:43] <mooff> i took over the php codebase written as someone's university project, who did a pretty great job of popularising it and making it fun to play.
[14:57:10] <Joanna> mnemon: ultima online siege perilous
[14:58:32] <mnemon> Played a lot of UO but not with this nick ;)
[14:58:58] <Joanna> mooff: this channel is similar to security but friendlier :)
[14:59:16] <mooff> (oh, sorry. i didn't see there was a mnemon here when i wrote those messages. i thought you were talking to me :D)
[14:59:41] <Joanna> That’s ok : )
[14:59:47] * mooff rub sleep out of eyes, reduce parallelism
[15:00:20] <Joanna> It’s all becomes a blur sometimes:) when chatting while tired :)
[15:00:41] <Joanna> mnemon: did you ever use easy uo ?
[15:01:37] <mnemon> yes
[15:01:49] <Joanna> mooff: irc is the closest I get to social media apps :)
[15:02:32] <Joanna> mnemon: I used to write easy up scripts after the number of players started to thin out to amuse myself I guess
[15:04:13] <mooff> what other kind of chatting is there?
[15:04:29] <mooff> there are other states than tired??
[15:06:19] <Joanna> Sure if you time it right
[15:06:40] <Joanna> Some people chat while working
[15:22:30] <Joanna> What happened to your web game ? I’ve always wanted to make a better version of online games but I lack both the skill and the time.
