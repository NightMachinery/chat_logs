[10:32:18] <ecloud> klm: personally I'm more interested in an mmap-friendly format lately, aka "zero-copy", aka word-aligned data types; just found out about Apache Arrow, and otherwise there's FlatBuffers
[10:32:25] <ecloud> but I haven't actually used any of those
[10:34:19] <ecloud> I tried writing something with cbor once and got peeved that it does exactly the wrong thing for memory alignment: since every individual value has a 1-byte tag prefix, you can never have alignment of anything
[10:39:29] <ecloud> I got around it by using arrays; at least you can copy that once and cast it to the type you want, and then loop through it; but it's not zero-copy
[10:41:52] <ecloud> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats
[10:45:05] <ecloud> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Arrow sounds good in theory, but I'm also a bit torn about whether it's a good idea to require a schema or not
[10:45:50] <ecloud> and then I saw https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#buffer-alignment-and-padding : "we suggest that you prefer using 64-byte alignment and padding" !!!
[10:46:58] <ecloud> so it's beginning to look like one of those classic trilemmas: you can have self-describing, memory-aligned or compact, but usually not all 3, and I want all 3
[10:49:36] <ecloud> and the suggested usage of Arrow is in-memory SIMD manipulation of large data sets, not for on-disk storage; e.g. they suggest using Parquet for storage, and deserializing into Arrow as the in-memory format
[10:52:08] <ecloud> so it looks to me like the choice is between FlatBuffers (use a schema) and FlexBuffers (no schema, but the code has to know what it's reading: the data is not self-describing)

[21:31:08] <Bunny351> * should be used, unless you want to make assumptions what internal type the library uses.
[21:31:35] <Bunny351> using the wrong type may of course result in undefined behaviour

[21:40:57] <Zipheir> That makes it hard to use the type checker with a library that doesn't provide types.
[21:42:16] <Bunny351> correct

[23:38:18] <Zipheir> Oops.
[23:39:15] <Zipheir> I suppose there's no CHICKEN type that describes a 2-list (symbol *).
