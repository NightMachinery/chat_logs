[12:14:30] <Carbonflux> here we have "defunded" our police so they won't come for stuff like that, but it balances out because we all have guns, a few shots thru the wall and most of the time people turn their music down.

[15:47:10] <dukwon> > A "Ghost Typer" in building 60 kept the Security Team puzzled in the first working days of 2022: for initially unclear reasons, gibberish appeared being typed on a certain computer while no one was actually touching it. USB devices and Bluetooth connections seemed idle, and the other possible (and worrying) explanation was a compromised computer. Finally, it turned out that a formerly paired keyboard found a new owner, but still sent keystrokes to 
[15:47:11] <dukwon> the wrong computer.
[15:47:42] <dukwon> so it was bluetooth?

[22:12:12] <T`aZ> https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/sgy96t/psa_linux_516_has_major_regression_in_btrfs/ yet peoople still try to say btrfs is stable
[22:14:54] <Faux> The workaround is to run a distro with releases after nutjobs have eliminated these bugs. >.>
[22:21:23] <dukwon> i'll still be on ext4 as long as that's what the OS installer chooses by default
[22:23:15] <Renderwww> if you don't pay for it you are the product!
[22:23:28] <Renderwww> the responsible kernel patch was probably sponsored by samsung
[22:24:09] <Oxyd> When I was installing my new computer, it didn't even cross my mind that there are other filesystems than ext4.
[22:24:59] <Faux> I think I have had something boring (like ubuntu) offer me something insane (like xfs).
[22:25:31] <Renderwww> /dev/mapper/SolusSystem-Root on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro)
[22:26:10] <Renderwww> does ext4 even have autodefrag?
[22:26:27] <dukwon> are we still meant to be defragging?
[22:27:01] <dukwon> i haven't done it in 15 years?
[22:27:27] <Renderwww> must be a btrfs thing
[22:30:05] <Renderwww> e4defrag -c /: 5 files fragmented
[22:30:10] <Renderwww>  Fragmentation score1
[22:30:15] <Renderwww>  [0-30 no problem: 31-55 a little bit fragmented: 56- needs defrag]
[22:31:58] <Renderwww> this install is from 2018 or something
[22:33:23] <dukwon> journaling++
[22:33:59] <Renderwww> looks my rpi uses btrfs but there is no autodefrag
[22:34:29] * Oxyd frags Renderwww's rpi.
[22:35:30] <Renderwww> the sd card in it uses ext4, only the external drive that doesn't get much write usage is btrfs
[22:37:49] <Renderwww> my desktop install is also from 2018 and has fragmentation score 0
[22:37:55] <Renderwww> is this the magic of loonix?
[22:38:06] <Oxyd> Maybe the defragmentation tool doesn't work.
[22:38:41] <Renderwww> if it didn't work I'm sure there would be a bug report in some bugtracker sitting there for the past 10 years!
[22:38:51] <Oxyd> Maybe there is!
[22:39:01] <dukwon> i think that's what journaling does, right?
[22:39:22] <dukwon> you don't get fragmentation while there's plenty of space left
[22:39:24] <Oxyd> I'm not sure. My understanding of journaling has always been that it's about filesystem integrity.
[22:39:37] <Oxyd> But I never studied filesystems in any depth.
[22:39:40] <Renderwww> I thought journaling was to prevent file loss in hard crash cases or some shit
[22:40:08] <Oxyd> Well it can't prevent loss of data in the file that was being written. But it should prevent the entire filesystem getting so hosed you can't read it at all.
[22:40:30] <Renderwww> so non journaling is better security wise!
[22:41:21] <markuskj> don't blindly trust journalists
[22:41:37] <Oxyd> I once turned my computer off without shutting down properly and then kept getting weird errors for days – a bunch of files like random .so's got truncated.
[22:42:24] <Oxyd> At least it happened to my root partition, so I could just do a consistency check on all installed packages and reinstall those whose files got corrupted.
