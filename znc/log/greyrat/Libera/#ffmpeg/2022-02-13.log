[15:39:33] <Eighth_Doctor> hey all
[15:39:56] <Eighth_Doctor> I'm trying to build ffmpeg from source and enable h264 and hevc hardware codecs without enabling software ones
[15:40:17] <Eighth_Doctor> it doesn't seem to let me do that for decoders like it does for encoders
[15:40:30] <Eighth_Doctor> is this expected behavior?

[15:47:25] <JEEB> Eighth_Doctor: I expect the parsing stuff to get enabled since the hwaccels of course need to parse the packets from the stuff and things such as the info in the headers
[15:47:49] <JEEB> encoders already expect you to give them all those parameters so they don't have to share such stuff (in general)
[15:48:22] <Eighth_Doctor> right
[15:48:48] <JEEB> I think you can still get them built in a manner that you don't have software decoding, but not like I've tried that as I have no use case for it. but at least historically I've seen people configuring FFmpeg like that
[15:49:54] <Eighth_Doctor> it seems to straight up skip them
[15:51:31] <JEEB> basically what you want is something akin to the current situation that exists with AV1, where FFmpeg itself doesn't have a full-blown decoder, but it needs enough facilities from the decoder and parser to get stuff from the headers and to split packets
[15:52:33] <Eighth_Doctor> yeah
[15:52:40] <Eighth_Doctor> here's my configure: https://paste.centos.org/view/5abc5ba6
[15:53:28] <Eighth_Doctor> despite asking for qsv, nvdec, vdpau, and vaapi for h264 and hevc decoders, they're all missing from the list
[15:53:46] <JEEB> yup, probably due to the decoder being specifically disabled
[15:54:23] <JEEB> so yea, I was never sure how people did the disablement of full decoding to be honest.
[15:54:29] <Eighth_Doctor> right, but if I don't do that, then I get everything
[15:54:33] <Eighth_Doctor> which I don't want
[15:54:39] <JEEB> also wow, crystalhd
[15:54:45] <JEEB> someone actually utilizing that library
[15:55:08] * Eighth_Doctor snorts
[15:55:25] <JEEB> at least no xvmc
[15:55:30] <Eighth_Doctor> I've been working with some folks for a while now to introduce an ffmpeg build for Fedora proper
[15:55:38] <Eighth_Doctor> so that's pretty much the use-case for it
[15:55:42] <JEEB> right
[15:56:05] <JEEB> I recall from the discussion when fedora was adding an AC-3 decoder that they needed to also strip stuff from the source code itself
[15:56:12] <Eighth_Doctor> yeah
[15:56:14] <JEEB> which is why they couldn't utilize FFmpeg's AC-3 decoder
[15:56:25] <JEEB> so how you do you manage this with just configuration? :D
[15:56:29] <Eighth_Doctor> https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ffmpeg/blob/rawhide/f/ffmpeg_free_sources
[15:56:43] <Eighth_Doctor> we blow away all files we don't want before generating the tarball
[15:56:49] <JEEB> ahh
[15:56:59] <Eighth_Doctor> https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ffmpeg/blob/rawhide/f/ffmpeg_gen_free_tarball.sh
[15:58:02] <Eighth_Doctor> it's a shame there isn't a flag for doing dlopen/dynlink for the codec libraries like there is for nvdec/nvenc and amf
[15:58:46] <Eighth_Doctor> but yeah, this is how we're doing it
[15:59:09] <JEEB> I think that was disliked due to the possibility of people plugging in proprietary things. although you then had people who wanted to distribute the plain minimum of certain types of codecs until a user required them etc. it rolls both ways
[15:59:41] <JEEB> there used to be a "register codec" thing, but since that API required internal symbols it was removed. I don't think anyone has proprosed a new one yet.
[15:59:48] <Eighth_Doctor> I see
[16:00:25] <JEEB> anyways, the use case is valid so I think even if it requires some work it might be a good idea to poke at #ffmpeg-devel regarding it if someone has an idea of how to proceed with it and what sort of changes would be required.

[16:01:04] <JEEB> well this was correct for initial questions

[21:54:47] <aphysically> hmm, I need to figure out while sometimes my streaming encodes that I output to an mkv file instead of streaming (generally for test purposes) end up with a ~1195 hour timestamp sometimes (but not always)
[21:55:23] <aphysically> it is a pain to debug since it doesn't seem to ever happen if I clip a small length (or must be rare?), and reencoding an entire long file for testing is annoying :)

[22:32:34] <aphysically> I also need to implement subtitle tonemapping, but I think it's a pain

[22:34:38] <aphysically> the subtitles are currently in sw cause I use scale2ref, so I probably want to do sw tonemapping but I'm assuming (?) picsubs won't normally be tagged so I'll have to try to decide what to tag it as based on the video stream it was packaged with, I guess?
