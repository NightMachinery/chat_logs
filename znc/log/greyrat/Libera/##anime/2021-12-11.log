[00:00:05] <ImoutoBot> [title] Gaslight (1944) - IMDb
[00:00:05] <Satin> new mexico has some sort of desert south, but it's semi-arid, and northern new mexico is nto the same
[00:00:15] <MootPoot> prohibition can work - depends on how deeply its entrenched into society
[00:00:15] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: derived from a movie called Gaslight per Wikipedia
[00:00:16] <Satin> emmeka: smh, not to me
[00:00:18] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: u forgot the /s was that implied?
[00:00:23] <MootPoot> I hate this stupid "prohibition never works" meme
[00:00:27] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: when I was in New Mexico it was snowing
[00:00:40] <MootPoot> sure, theres gonna be ONE dude at least somewhere breaking it
[00:00:48] <Satin> emmeka: again, arizona is far more dry and desert-ey than us in general
[00:00:49] <MootPoot> but the point is to set a general practice
[00:01:00] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: Does that explain it?
[00:01:02] <MootPoot> why prohibit murder? You cant stop it 
[00:01:03] <ButterNoodle> yea.. prohibition in the 20s is why we have gang violence /s
[00:01:03] <Satin> fuck i started choking on my iced tea
[00:01:04] <MootPoot> KatrinValerie: yes
[00:01:09] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: that's not the issue, the issue is that it makes a new crime extremely profitable because prohibition doesn't actually decrease the demand for a product, only the supply
[00:01:14] <MootPoot> Satin: ur fault for drinking tea
[00:01:15] <MootPoot> n00b
[00:01:21] <Jigsy> Except that prohibition doesn't work.
[00:01:25] <ButterNoodle> PUT THE TEA IN THE HARBOR
[00:01:27] <Satin> MootPoot: peace tea
[00:01:31] <Satin> it isn't actual tea
[00:01:34] <Jigsy> Remember when they banned drugs?
[00:01:35] <emmeka> I guess one thing that's interesting is that most of NM gets about the same precipitation as the prairies parts of Alberta and SK, in some cases, more, but AB can do rainfed agriculture and NM can't.
[00:01:37] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: basically the actions of the husband in the movie are prototypical gaslighting
[00:01:38] <Jigsy> And everyone stopped doing them?
[00:01:38] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: murder isn't in high demand, or a culturally supported thing
[00:01:40] <emmeka> because snowpack
[00:01:40] <Jigsy> Yeah, me neither.
[00:01:46] <ButterNoodle> remember when they banned crime
[00:01:47] <emmeka> winter: basically moisture banking
[00:01:50] <ButterNoodle> in houston?
[00:01:54] <Satin> most of NM is mountainous sort of stuff
[00:01:59] <MootPoot> Jigsy: china and guns, japan and guns , saudi arabia and drugs , etc
[00:02:01] <ButterNoodle> "and they are still looking for the suspects"
[00:02:02] <Satin> i live near the sandia mountains
[00:02:07] <emmeka> well yes the parts with pinyons are nice and all
[00:02:09] <MootPoot> plenty examples of prohibition working
[00:02:10] <KatrinValerie> It's a portrait of a real occuring behaviour
[00:02:14] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: wdym
[00:02:16] <emmeka> but nobody in NM *lives* at high altitude
[00:02:18] <Satin> we have Los Alamos labs not that far, Sandia National Labs in the other way as well near ABQ
[00:02:22] <KatrinValerie> And let me tell you this, gaslighting is fucking scary
[00:02:24] <Jigsy> Shotguns are legal in Japan from what I've been told.
[00:02:25] <Satin> emmeka: define high altitude
[00:02:26] <MootPoot> ( yes, I know japan hasent REALLY banned guns ) but still
[00:02:35] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: the yakuza is a thing
[00:02:51] <TsundereNoises> the solution to prohibition, from a consumer point of view, is organized crime
[00:02:52] <Satin> what is high altitude/elevation to you
[00:02:52] <MootPoot> the point is "prohibition never works" is basically a argument against making any rules ever
[00:02:53] <Jigsy> And The Triads.
[00:02:57] <ButterNoodle> japan has had strict weapons laws since 1876
[00:02:59] <ButterNoodle> and japan
[00:03:06] <Satin> my elevation right now is 4,600

[00:03:28] <Satin> Taos, NM where I sometimes pass through and have been to
[00:03:30] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: and no it's not, it's an argument against banning a good (NOT an act) without doing anything to reduce the demand

[00:03:33] <Jigsy> ...and we have knife crime, so...
[00:03:33] <emmeka> Satin I guess in this context, within the altitude range of the montane forests.
[00:03:46] <Satin> as far as I'm concerned i'm explicitly up in the mountains lol

[00:18:52] <Cryowolf> only thing I would recommend is good micronized and triple buffered creatine (micronized and triple buffered because it's easier on your stomach,. not because its better)
[00:18:52] <Satin> emmeka: I do both. 
[00:18:56] <KatrinValerie> and I don't have a jogging route currently, which used to be my main sport
[00:18:56] <emmeka> I tried an experiment once. I sketched scenery I remembered from when I was young, and then compared it to the actual thing as I seen it later
[00:19:03] <Cryowolf> creatine can help a lot
[00:19:10] <Fenderbassist> boosting ATPs, last I read
[00:19:15] <emmeka> the version in my memories was a lot more grandiose
[00:19:17] <Fenderbassist> converting ADPs to ATPs I believe
[00:19:21] <Satin> I like sharing it with people (not in an instagram way, but more like with friends or people who ask) or just for documentating my experiences
[00:19:32] <Fenderbassist> I tried creatine very briefly back in the 90s when I used to sell it, not really into that now
[00:19:36] <Fenderbassist> I'm gonna be 60 in a few years
[00:19:50] <Satin> but I also  have spent plenty of nights alone, in the dark, right under the stars silently, or driving alone through amazing scenery
[00:20:06] <MootPoot> Satin: are u the girl on my wallpaper
[00:20:16] <KatrinValerie> Fenderbassist: hearing your workout routine, you are probably still healthier than most people your age
[00:20:21] <KatrinValerie> I mean more fit
[00:20:23] <Satin> emmeka: yeah i don't ever feel like anything i capture matches how it's like to experience it in person, but it's nice to try sometimes :p

[00:20:39] <Fenderbassist> yeah I can still carry the PA bass bins, one in each hand, where the guitarist can barely carry one lol

[00:24:43] <Satin> both experiences are amazing to me, being in person in there, taking in the sublime
[00:24:46] <Cryowolf> Fenderbassist, theres a lot of different creatine these days being marketed. But dont believe the hype of all the weird naming and stuff. Creatine is creatine. Once it's in your muscle, it's all the same. The only difference I would say is how easy it is on your stomach
[00:24:51] <Cryowolf> and might as well go with the cheapest the
[00:24:54] <Cryowolf> then*
[00:24:55] <Satin> and also being able to see individual details in a picture that blows up certain details
[00:25:13] <Satin> just different ways/things

[00:41:58] <snake> everyone who looks ripped like that is on roids
[00:42:00] <Fenderbassist> getting that big usually takes steroids
[00:42:02] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, he's at what can be achieved naturally still though. Gotta see his traps to know
[00:42:09] <Cryowolf> snake, no they're not
[00:42:14] <snake> Bco1981, its not the same when they're cold lol
[00:42:21] <snake> Cryowolf, uhuh, sure... :|
[00:42:29] <Satin> Texas sucks
[00:42:33] <snake> cringe, the ripped dudes think we don't know xD
[00:42:43] <Bco1981> snake: warm them up... with your "body"
[00:42:44] <Cryowolf> his fat percentage also matters. He could have veins like that without having low body fat
[00:42:48] <Fenderbassist> a guy that starts really young and sticks with it can get big naturally to a point
[00:42:51] <KatrinValerie> I just wanted to word it in ways that couldn't be construed as libel
[00:43:16] <Cryowolf> genetics also matter and I would swear to you that most people who use steroids, you can't tell. Cause they just don't get big enough
[00:43:31] <Fenderbassist> genetics matter a lot
[00:43:34] <Cryowolf> he's at the border of what is either amazing genetics, or steroids
[00:43:43] <Cryowolf> well amazing genetics and steroids
[00:43:46] <KatrinValerie> And hormones make a difference too
[00:44:01] <Fenderbassist> eating properly counts too
[00:44:03] <Cryowolf> steroids is usually testosterone, that would be what people normally take
[00:44:12] <snake> every part of ourselves is "genetics" it kind of goes without saying
[00:44:13] <Fenderbassist> need some saturated fat to make testosterone
[00:44:26] <Cryowolf> unless its exogenously added
[00:44:30] <Fenderbassist> and proper amount of protein often enough to support that kind of growth
[00:44:49] <Fenderbassist> you won't get super muscular on a junk bulk diet, you gotta have good proteins
[00:44:51] <Cryowolf> he is likely on steroids, but there's a chance he's natural
[00:45:00] <Cryowolf> would have to see with shirt off
[00:45:11] <KatrinValerie> got to be careful with steroids
[00:45:13] <Cryowolf> cause shirt on can make arms and chest look bigger if youve got higher fat
[00:45:19] <KatrinValerie> or you end up with boobs like me xD
[00:45:30] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, well....you take estrogen I assume :P
[00:45:33] <Cryowolf> not testosterone
[00:45:38] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: best steroid imho
[00:45:46] <Cryowolf> but yeah you can aromatize into estradiol
[00:45:48] <Cryowolf> and then you get moobs
[00:46:21] <Cryowolf> also Fenderbassist, stay the fuck away from SARMS
[00:46:24] <MootPoot> I have moobs without steroids
[00:46:28] <MootPoot> clearly I am superior
[00:46:38] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: sorry what are SARMS ?
[00:46:50] <Cryowolf> you dont know what any vendor puts in them, so you dont know if you're actually getting SARMS anyway. Also, they're mostly very untested aside from Ostarine
[00:47:09] <Cryowolf> selective-androgen receptor modulator
[00:47:10] <Fenderbassist> oh another sport supplement, legal or otherwise?
[00:47:20] <Fenderbassist> oh I never bothered with any of that stuff
[00:47:22] <Fenderbassist> I went natural
[00:47:23] <Cryowolf> it's on par with steroids
[00:47:34] <Cryowolf> but since its a research chemical, it's "legal" to purchase
[00:47:37] <Fenderbassist> I see
[00:47:42] <Fenderbassist> I wouldn't mess with any of that stuff
[00:47:44] <Cryowolf> but also it's a research chemical
[00:47:51] <Cryowolf> many of them arent even in human trials
[00:48:00] <Cryowolf> some were abandoned from human trials
[00:48:04] <Cryowolf> cause safety profile wasnt sufficient
[00:48:16] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[00:48:22] <Fenderbassist> good to know
[00:48:31] <Cryowolf> yet people take them....cause they can't get a hold of steroids, so they visit a random site and buy em. But you also dont know if you actually bought the real deal
[00:48:37] <Cryowolf> since there's no agency to regulate that
[00:48:50] <Fenderbassist> not a good idea
[00:48:55] <Cryowolf> so yeah, never buy that stuff
[00:48:55] <Fenderbassist> is asking for trouble
[00:49:01] <Fenderbassist> better to live healthy
[00:49:03] <Cryowolf> testosterone would be better if you had to
[00:49:12] <Cryowolf> what you should do is get your doctor to give you TRT
[00:49:24] <Fenderbassist> I would only consider that, via a physician who isn't a whacko
[00:49:27] <Cryowolf> get your testosterone into mid levels
[00:49:32] <Fenderbassist> given my OLD AGE :P
[00:49:34] <Cryowolf> like 500-600
[00:49:34] <Fenderbassist> :)
[00:49:46] <Fenderbassist> yeah I feel like I'm between 500 and 600 y.o. lol
[00:49:48] <Cryowolf> 500-600 would be what someone in their 30s have
[00:49:57] <Fenderbassist> I'm like the Mummy from the movies
[00:49:58] <Cryowolf> you probably have 300-400
[00:50:02] <Fenderbassist> 500 years old
[00:50:06] <Cryowolf> lol
[00:50:08] <Fenderbassist> lol
[00:50:13] <Cryowolf> but with trt you can get up to 500
[00:50:18] <Cryowolf> and put muscle back on fast
[00:50:25] <Fenderbassist> I'll get tested one of these days
[00:50:32] <KatrinValerie> I see numbers without units and my BP rises
[00:50:33] <Cryowolf> cause exogenous introduction to your body, you'll have all of it be free test
[00:50:50] <Cryowolf> but make sure its via a doctor
[00:50:52] <Cryowolf> a good one
[00:50:53] <Satin> i'm 'bout to go 100
[00:51:17] <KatrinValerie> I will assume ng/dL
[00:51:20] <Cryowolf> so they test your blood, bp, hr etc
[00:51:30] <Fenderbassist> exactly
[00:51:38] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: what's your BP? 140?
[00:51:57] <Satin> 69
[00:51:58] <Cryowolf> theres teo ways to measure it KatrinValerie, if it seems like 100x over what it is in what you normally use, then it's the other one :P
[00:52:00] <TsundereNoises> hawt
[00:52:01] <Fenderbassist> my last BP measurement (I get them every week) was 122/86
[00:52:13] <Cryowolf> I have naturally low BP, especially when I work out
[00:52:14] <Fenderbassist> a tiny bit high
[00:52:33] <Cryowolf> when I was in my prime before I got cancer, I had like 108/59 with a resting HR of 54

[00:59:45] <Cryowolf> if I go lie down for 30 mins it ends up at around 64
[00:59:49] <Bco1981> Nanobot: lol
[00:59:51] <Satin> i know yeah
[00:59:59] <Nanobot> And she just crashed again
[01:00:01] <Satin> my heartrate is always more active whenever i'm slightly moving i think
[01:00:07] <Satin> even when in the hospital
[01:00:14] <Satin> the nurses were always concerned slightly about my heartrate being faster lol
[01:00:17] <Bco1981> en curse still doing it's job.
[01:00:43] <Jigsy> "I-It's because of you, nurse-san!"
[01:00:51] <TsundereNoises> kawaii
[01:00:57] <Jigsy> *blush* *fidgit*
[01:01:05] <KatrinValerie> when I was in the ICU after my first grandmal the nurses were concerned about my low heart rate XD
[01:01:25] <KatrinValerie> back then I was still really active and my heart rate would drop to 40 when I was close to falling asleep
[01:01:37] <KatrinValerie> and then the stupid ICU monitor thing would ring an alarm and wake me up
[01:02:06] <Nanobot> Third crash. I don't think her costume reveal is happening right now.
[01:02:26] <Cryowolf> one of those heartrate devices that measure it automatically stopped being able to read my bp and hr and showed a bp of 350/180 and a HR of 210
[01:02:30] <Cryowolf> so they panicked first
[01:02:36] <Cryowolf> I was swarmed by nurses
[01:02:43] <KatrinValerie> broken device?
[01:02:45] <Cryowolf> they hooked me up to EEG etc
[01:02:52] <Cryowolf> no it only did that with me for some reason
[01:02:52] <Satin> because of all the blood loss stuff, the cortisol imbalance stuff is still causing my blood pressure to be on the higher end last i checked but i don't have numbers
[01:02:54] <Cryowolf> just me
[01:02:58] <Urchin[emacs]> heart rate is easy to measure if you have a pulse oximeter
[01:02:59] <Satin> just what i remember i think being told by the doc
[01:03:02] <Cryowolf> then they took it manually
[01:03:08] <Cryowolf> and it was normal
[01:03:26] <KatrinValerie> Satin: sounds bad
[01:03:31] <Urchin[emacs]> which have gotten more common since the pandemic started (as blood oxygenation is an indicator if medical intervention with the ventilator is required)
[01:03:55] <Satin> KatrinValerie: i mean, it is, but it's better than bleeding to death
[01:04:04] <Satin> which i was close to lolz
[01:04:08] <KatrinValerie> oof
[01:04:28] <Satin> the cortisol bullshit is also behind somtehing hpv axis ptsd something
[01:04:34] <TsundereNoises> it's so weird to read things like "no informed consent documentation was found" regarding medical procedures in the 1800s
[01:04:36] <Satin> and i have bad tremors often
[01:04:40] <Cryowolf> My pain threshold has gone up since my surgeries this year 
[01:04:41] <TsundereNoises> like I'm sure that's true, but it's not helpful
[01:04:46] <Satin> TsundereNoises: lol
[01:04:52] <Satin> Cryowolf: same
[01:04:53] <TsundereNoises> and kind of hurts the point via weak evidence
[01:05:19] <Cryowolf> Satin, I mean I still feel the pain but, it gets locked away
[01:05:30] <Cryowolf> if it's acute that is
[01:05:32] <Cryowolf> not chronic
[01:05:39] <Satin> Cryowolf: student nurse jabbed me in the wrong place in a follow up procudure to take out a stent in my liver
[01:05:42] <Satin> for the iv
[01:05:43] <Cryowolf> I wouldnt be able to compartmentalize chronic pain
[01:05:49] <Satin> and i just went "euuuhih it's ok"
[01:05:50] <Satin> lmao
[01:05:56] <Cryowolf> lol
[01:05:58] <TsundereNoises> I feel like bullshitty evidence kind of hurts even an otherwise strong argument
[01:06:01] <TsundereNoises> like just leave off the BS
[01:06:20] <Cryowolf> I was more concerned with things that would make me vomit
[01:06:42] <Satin> i mean to be fair, i'm apparently harder to get my veins found, from all the repeated surgeries and stuff and drying up + my body just being me, but still
[01:06:44] <Cryowolf> like having a v-sond or whatever theyre called in English up my nose and down my throat to my stomach
[01:06:47] <Satin> the experienced nurse immediatly did it
[01:06:50] <Cryowolf> to catch the stomach acid
[01:06:53] <Cryowolf> and juices
[01:06:56] <Jigsy> Ultrasound?
[01:07:04] <Cryowolf> so they dont bubble up and cause damage
[01:07:06] <Jigsy> Oh.
[01:07:09] <Jigsy> An endoscopy?
[01:07:12] <Satin> Cryowolf: i had an NG tube down my nose for a while
[01:07:13] <Cryowolf> no
[01:07:18] <Satin> not the same thing but it was for food
[01:07:20] <Cryowolf> it was a tube I wore 24/7
[01:07:23] <Jigsy> I had to have an endoscopy.
[01:07:26] <Jigsy> Hated it.
[01:07:36] <Cryowolf> Satin, ah
[01:07:39] <Satin> "A nasogastric tube (NG tube) is a special tube that carries food and medicine to the stomach through the nose. It can be used for all feedings or for giving a person extra calories. You'll learn to take good care of the tubing and the skin around the nostrils so that the skin doesn't get irritated."
[01:07:40] <Cryowolf> I had food in my CVK
[01:07:41] <Satin> i hated it
[01:07:50] <Jigsy> The only bit I remember is a cute Indian nurse going...
[01:07:52] <Cryowolf> injected directly into my bloodsream
[01:07:52] <Satin> hated it so much
[01:07:55] <Jigsy> "His heart rate just shot up."
[01:08:06] <Satin> but they did it bceause i wasn't eating enough or something
[01:08:18] <Satin> or couldn't eat enough to sustain stuff
[01:08:25] <Cryowolf> same
[01:08:35] <Cryowolf> my stomach sack was crushed into a pancake
[01:08:36] <Cryowolf> I couldnt eat
[01:08:40] <Cryowolf> physically unable
[01:08:40] <Satin> dang
[01:08:51] <Satin> my stomach was messed up, id on't think it was crushed
[01:08:57] <Satin> but it was weird times
[01:09:02] <Cryowolf> well the tumor had pancaked it
[01:09:09] <KatrinValerie> not being able to eat is so horrible
[01:09:12] <Cryowolf> so I received nutrients through myCVK
[01:09:17] <Satin> took ages even after the hospital where finally going to the restroom was like "yes, that's more normal."
[01:09:20] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, not once you get those nutrients
[01:09:23] <Cryowolf> your apetite goes away
[01:09:24] <Satin> "and not green weird stuff coming out of me"
[01:09:46] <Satin> yeah i missed being able to eat, but mostly because i hated the ng tube
[01:09:50] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I never got that luxury when I had stomach issues to the point where I could not keep food down
[01:10:01] <Satin> and they sort of threatened to put the ng tube back on me or something in a way
[01:10:15] <Satin> so i urgently ate as much as i could to show them i was going to be able to eat xd
[01:10:25] <Cryowolf> the tube in my nose sucked up juices and acid and it was green, with little brownish lumps (that was slime I had coughed out of my lungs and swallowed). The tube was there to suck it all up since they had removed half the stomach sack and needed to keep acid away so it would heal
[01:10:31] <Satin> the worse part of the ng tubes was no water etc 
[01:10:43] <Satin> Cryowolf: wild
[01:10:50] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, oh there was no luxury about my situation :P
[01:10:55] <Satin> i can imagine
[01:11:01] <KatrinValerie> true
[01:12:30] <KatrinValerie> i wonder if I should stop self medicating so my stomach issues get checked properly for once
[01:12:39] * Jigsy stretches.
[01:12:43] <Jigsy> Hardly played this game at all today.
[01:12:44] <Cryowolf> probably?
[01:12:46] <KatrinValerie> but I don't want to end up losing all the weight I fought so hard to gain
[01:13:12] <Cryowolf> does pot help?
[01:13:19] <KatrinValerie> A whole lot
[01:13:26] <Cryowolf> is that your selfmedication?
[01:13:30] <KatrinValerie> Yes
[01:13:46] <Jigsy> Guess I'll do some more of my no-levelling up FFXIII challenge.
[01:13:47] <KatrinValerie> I don't get as bad stomach pains and I do not get nauseous anymore
[01:13:53] <Cryowolf> hmmm
[01:13:56] <KatrinValerie> if I wean it off, it starts back up after a week or so
[01:14:04] <KatrinValerie> the stomach issues
[01:14:22] <Cryowolf> Does Metoclopramide help?
[01:14:28] <Cryowolf> did you ever get that?
[01:14:37] <Cryowolf> alongside Esomeprazole
[01:14:44] <KatrinValerie> It does help temporarily against the nausea
[01:14:50] <KatrinValerie> but I couldn't take it for long
[01:15:04] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I had pantoprazol
[01:15:16] <Cryowolf> why couldnt you take it for long?
[01:15:24] <KatrinValerie> My GP said I needed to stop it
[01:15:26] <Cryowolf> I took it like 3-4 a day for months
[01:15:47] <Cryowolf> and I would still have it if it wasn't out of stock everywhere
[01:15:53] <Cryowolf> and factories unable to produce it

[01:21:43] <Fenderbassist> one girl, very pretty, met 10 of her biggest fans at a restaurant
[01:22:00] <Fenderbassist> and they all watched the stream of THEM instead of looking at the girl and talking to her

[01:22:33] <Matt|home> .....
[01:22:34] <Cryowolf> and you heard this from an autist
[01:22:41] <Cryowolf> an autist just complained about people not being social
[01:22:44] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: relatable 
[01:22:51] <Matt|home> is that actually a thing from japan and not just a fantasy trope? extreme communication difficulties?

[01:25:23] <MootPoot> Bco1981: literally all the chinese streaming apps
[01:25:23] <Satin> i think the likelyhood of autism for such a significant phenomona is low
[01:25:35] <Matt|home> i mean communication is such a fundamental evolutionary adaptation that severe social phobia _should_ wipe itself out over time no?
[01:26:09] <Cryowolf> no, the only way for severe social phobia to wipe itself out is through natural selection if we return toi primitive times
[01:26:16] <Cryowolf> where that gene would die out
[01:26:33] <Cryowolf> eugenics in action but naturally
[01:26:37] <Matt|home> if it's environmental then that would indicate a really big problem with those geographical areas for social development
[01:26:39] <Satin> you're too quick to draw connections between evolutionary psychology and social phenomona/human behaviour
[01:27:05] <Bco1981> MootPoot: that has 1080p60...
[01:27:11] <Matt|home> im curious about it. i heard japan got really westernized over the years, so im curious what differences exist between us to make that a significant phenomenon
[01:27:13] <Satin> there's a myarid of reasons, culture, economic circumstances, societal conceptions
[01:27:27] <Satin> studying those factors is far more fruitful than "must be this gene"
[01:27:29] <MootPoot> Bco1981: best you can get in most cases 
[01:27:32] <MootPoot> Sadly 
[01:27:48] <MootPoot> I saw one streamer once with 4k30

[01:46:22] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: muslim teacher in quebec can't teach anymore because she wants to wear a hijab
[01:46:34] <TsundereNoises> new thing
[01:46:39] <emmeka> oh, old news.
[01:46:40] <emmeka> not new.
[01:46:43] <TsundereNoises> because of the no government religion law
[01:46:45] <TsundereNoises> news*
[01:46:47] <TsundereNoises> sorry
[01:47:21] <emmeka> TsundereNoises so uhhh there's history to this to unpack.
[01:47:59] <TsundereNoises> stumbled across it while reading other stuff, is it an exciting clusterfuck?
[01:48:18] <TsundereNoises> or just you mean state-sponsored catholicism?
[01:48:51] <emmeka> QC takes secularism very very seriously, it is a foundational value there, owing to la révolution tranquille and the whole clusterfuck that was the essentially Catholic state of la grande noirceur
[01:49:02] <TsundereNoises> I did think it was new news because I can't be bothered reading dates when it's a tangent of a tangent
[01:49:55] <TsundereNoises> as an atheist, I still feel like they're doing it wrong
[01:51:14] <Jigsy> So if all the leaves are brown and the skies are gray, why don't they just move?
[01:51:27] <TsundereNoises> because orange leaves are pretty
[01:51:30] <TsundereNoises> before they get brown
[01:51:38] <emmeka> TsundereNoises basically the entire process of modernizing/industrializing Québec, very rapidly, was tied up with removal of the church from all elements of the state. In Québec, you can't wear crosses if you're a public sector worker, religious schools are banned, it is banned for someone to take their spouse's last name in Christian tradition, public religion of most kinds of banned.
[01:51:49] <emmeka> initially this was a process targetted entirely at the Catholic church
[01:51:50] <Fenderbassist> California Dreamin by The Mommas and The Poppas
[01:52:25] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I wish we could ban at least funding going to religious schools here
[01:52:35] <emmeka> TsundereNoises but then in recent times there have been right populist forces in QC, like the CAQ, that have been sorting of trying to push the issue of secularism more onto Muslims
[01:52:37] <TsundereNoises> and maybe force teaching of non-revisionist history, that'd be nice
[01:52:58] <emmeka> so they're kind of trying to take a core value of society there and wield it against immigrants
[01:53:06] <TsundereNoises> and succeeding
[01:53:23] <davic> done working overtime for this week
[01:53:25] <davic> hello lads
[01:53:29] <TsundereNoises> I mean having legal protections against making people feel outcast for not being in the majority religion is something I can absolutely get behind
[01:53:31] <TsundereNoises> but this is...
[01:53:49] <TsundereNoises> hi davic
[01:54:47] <Fenderbassist> hi davic
[01:54:49] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the first attempt at this law was in 2013, and the party trying to pass it was voted out at the time. But then the CAQ went and won a whole election, and then they went and passed a similar law themselves, and it has so far withstood court tests
[01:55:00] <Satin> MootPoot: is it normal to take an object incoming and then just... cast it to a certain type?

[01:55:25] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I mean looks like this is going to get one
[01:55:32] <emmeka> TsundereNoises if it's any consolation, besides doing things like banning hijabs on public servants, it also bans crosses, and proclaims Québec an officially secular state.
[01:55:52] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and I can get behind that
[01:56:13] <TsundereNoises> but I think laws should generally be there to protect the people without the power
[01:57:34] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: at least it's less crazy than our new idea down here that freedom of religion = freedom to be bigoted
[01:58:08] <TsundereNoises> which I'm worried is catching on a bit too well, especially with the current state of the district courts
[01:58:13] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the previous law proposed by the PQ was actually explicitly racist, it banned all Muslim symbols but basically permitted Christian ones
[01:58:25] <emmeka> but the current one by the CAQ, they have learned, and decided to just go all out
[01:58:30] <TsundereNoises> can we call that "pulling a switzerland"
[01:58:46] <emmeka> it bans every single religious symbol, except permanent tattoos and hairstyles
[01:59:27] <emmeka> also iirc it grandfathered in existing workers?
[01:59:33] <MootPoot> PQ?
[01:59:33] <emmeka> so idk what that story is about
[01:59:43] <MootPoot> Quebec provincial court?

[02:00:26] <TsundereNoises> am I drunk?
[02:00:36] <Satin> are you?
[02:00:43] <MootPoot> It had a downfall?
[02:00:45] <TsundereNoises> no, sadly

[02:01:20] <emmeka> MootPoot yes. a new party, the CAQ, currently holds power there. It kind of came out of nowhere. Both 2 big parties there collapsed in the last election, only a few seats each

[02:02:19] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: it's okay
[02:02:21] <emmeka> it's not as if Muslims are targetted by the law specifically, even
[02:02:23] <TsundereNoises> I just wanted to mention it
[02:02:58] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I keeping stumbling across more and more annoying things on sidetracks from anything I meant to be doing
[02:03:03] <Satin> TsundereNoises: which yuri manga?
[02:03:04] <TsundereNoises> I'm several layers down at this point
[02:03:07] <emmeka> maybe if your culture tells you that it's absolutely necessary to enforce religious symbols, don't live in a nation which considers not doing so to be a fundamental national value
[02:03:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: all of 'em, Katie

[02:03:45] <Satin> davic: i just don't understand OOP stuff properly, and I'm confused when this sort of thing happens
[02:03:49] <TsundereNoises> Satin: the problem is right now I'm not particularly drunk on life, I'm having a yuri withdrawl
[02:03:54] <TsundereNoises> might read that vampire thing Urchin mentioned
[02:03:58] <Satin> the entire object is being passed, and then magically, through casting, you can turn it into a window type
[02:03:59] <emmeka> TsundereNoises and fwiw this is a law that applies *only* to public sector workers, and only when on-duty
[02:04:23] <emmeka> if you're working for a government that proclaims itself officially secular in all things, you should probably present that secularism
[02:05:03] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: kids being exposed to representation of different cultures is inherently valuable
[02:05:05] <emmeka> or you know, go into the private sector and do whatever you want because it's a free country
[02:05:11] <TsundereNoises> I'm opposed to teaching religion
[02:05:11] <TsundereNoises> but
[02:05:29] <Satin> this is fundamentally up to what people want their culture/government to be like
[02:05:42] <Satin> not every place has to be "multicultural" or held to those standards
[02:05:44] <MootPoot> I'd rather have religion taught then socially ingrained 
[02:05:46] <davic> Satin: well im not 100% sure about C++ or what ever that is
[02:05:51] <Satin> davic: C
[02:05:55] <emmeka> Satin except here. then it does. it's in the constitution.
[02:06:02] <MootPoot> Socially ingrained religion seems to result in more lunatics 
[02:06:05] <MootPoot> Imo
[02:06:12] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you'd rather have religion taught than have your kids see a muslim 
[02:06:16] <davic> in Erlang/Elixir (and other) casting it to different types is a "fingers crossed and it might work"
[02:06:20] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: ? Wym
[02:06:24] <Satin> emmeka: your constitution emphasizes multiculturalism and diversity?
[02:06:32] <Satin> then shouldn't the hijab wearing while teaching be allowed?
[02:06:33] <MootPoot> I'd be fine with both at the same time 
[02:07:10] <MootPoot> Satin: it's Quebec, they're a bit ..special
[02:07:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and anyway, I'd argue there are fucking yuge social benefits to being exposed to other cultures, and allowing people to self-segregate is inherently bad for society
[02:07:15] <MootPoot> Let them be 
[02:07:16] <TsundereNoises> and contagious
[02:07:29] <emmeka> Satin Sec 27 of the charter of rights and freedoms. It requires that the charter is interpretted in a way that preserves and enhances the multicultural nature of Canadians
[02:07:47] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: what I mean by taught is like , religion as a subject in public schools, you can take it if you want - any one you want 
[02:07:50] <Satin> emmeka: then this quebec thing violates that?
[02:07:57] <MootPoot> Not explicitly religious schools 
[02:07:59] <Satin> principally, maybe not legally necessarly
[02:08:02] <emmeka> yes, but it's ok, but it's passed notwithstanding
[02:08:07] <emmeka> because you can just do that here
[02:08:13] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm actually opposed to that if it isn't like a 1 class that covers 10 different religions kind of thing
[02:08:19] <TsundereNoises> peer pressure is a thing
[02:08:24] <TsundereNoises> as is parental pressure
[02:08:30] <emmeka> say outright that a law is unconstitutional, and pass it anyway, and so long as you're being honest it's fine
[02:08:37] <Satin> le fuck
[02:08:42] <MootPoot> Sure, but like peer and parental pressure will always exist 
[02:09:00] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes, but they shouldn't be further enabled by the government against kids who have no other option
[02:09:07] <Satin> emmeka: weird, but i see...
[02:09:08] <emmeka> Satin yep. we have a clause in our constitution that allows you to ignore the constitution
[02:09:08] <MootPoot> It's upto the school to teach it as a subject rather then a ideology 
[02:09:15] <emmeka> it's better this way, really
[02:09:31] <MootPoot> Satin: it has a break statement in it 
[02:09:32] <MootPoot> Lol
[02:09:38] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: and creating a single class for a single religion is just asking for it to be taught as an ideology
[02:09:40] <Satin> i mean, yeah, i don't really care to scrutinize that, my overall point was just, it should depend on them ultimately
[02:09:43] <emmeka> instead of having to go through legal gymnastics to get courts to squint and say "yeaaaaaah that's constitutional, kind of sort of enough", we can just be honest
[02:09:48] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I disagree 
[02:10:06] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: practically you're never going to stay on top of enforcement
[02:10:12] <Satin> I hold the US to different cultural standards and values than other places
[02:10:14] <TsundereNoises> especially on such a slippery issue
[02:10:45] <emmeka> Satin but personally I would consider this law to be compatible with the official multiculturalism clause, the one it isn't compatible with is the part about freedom of religion and express
[02:10:49] <emmeka> *expression
[02:10:50] <TsundereNoises> Satin: do you think a teacher should be allowed to wear a hijab, that's fundamentally what we're arguing about
[02:10:52] <Satin> many of US want the US to be a certain way and treat people of different backgrounds a different way, and we were built on certian claimed ideals, even if they weren't actually followed
[02:11:03] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yes, but in the US. Not necessarily in Canada.
[02:11:19] <Satin> that's their business
[02:11:28] <TsundereNoises> Satin: Why are you only allowed to whine about places where you can vote, that's boring
[02:11:31] <emmeka> but I'm not committed personally to defending the right of religious expression and think secularization is fine so far as it upholds multiculturalism
[02:11:59] <Satin> TsundereNoises: because culture and cultural conceptions vary, I think it's fine to make arguments and whine about it for sure :p
[02:11:59] <TsundereNoises> I think literally every country has plenty of fucked up things
[02:12:07] <TsundereNoises> Canada is actually pretty great on average from where I'm sitting
[02:12:17] <Satin> I wouldn't apply american ideals of multiculturalism on india for example
[02:12:44] <Satin> the whole cultural conception of what religion and identity even is, is less about individuals and more about distinct ethnicities and communities
[02:12:48] <Satin> downsides and upsides
[02:12:52] <Satin> different history and context
[02:12:59] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I sure as hell don't think we're perfect here, but I hate the slippery slope to Saudi Arabia, if you get what I mean
[02:13:06] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yes
[02:13:07] <Satin> i do
[02:13:11] <emmeka> I think our notion of things is that someone's cultural identity, their heritage and nation, is separate from their Canadian-ness
[02:13:53] <emmeka> and that generally existing cultural identities are to be preserved, rather than assimilating immigrants into some sort of one national culture
[02:14:00] <Satin> the US is just a mess in that regard, but we think about things, especially in recent times as white-default-culture is being dismantled, as something like that
[02:14:02] <TsundereNoises> are first nations people on reservations canadian citizens?
[02:14:18] <emmeka> TsundereNoises now, yes. wasn't that way until the 70s...
[02:14:27] <MootPoot> WOAH 
[02:14:28] * Satin strongly thinks the US needs to frickin' emphasize a new sense of national identity though that goes beyond those things though

[02:15:01] <MootPoot> right , its diamond
[02:15:02] <emmeka> I can't pan that!
[02:15:25] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I certainly don't think our culture is right about anything, but I think being allowed to have discussions with people in other countries who disagree and have REASONS is more important than whatever cultural relativism stuff
[02:16:01] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I didn't mean to come off as if I was suggesting we can't criticize or critique other cultures or give free passes to Bad Things in other cultures sorry.
[02:16:01] <TsundereNoises> Satin: we ARE emphasizing a new sense of national identity, you've surely heard about what a good christian Jefferson was...
[02:16:13] <Satin> I think it's just good to keep the relativism aspect in mind to a degree.
[02:16:18] <TsundereNoises> Satin: that's very much how it came across, but no worries
[02:16:21] <emmeka> but why would you really, really want people to be able to openly and freely express their religious beliefs specifically while representing the government
[02:16:35] <emmeka> doesn't that just sound like the worst thing ever
[02:16:49] <emmeka> ask yourself, do you want Christians to have that power? no. this takes that away from them.
[02:16:54] <TsundereNoises> and I think while it's definitely important not to take all our default beliefs for granted, cultural relativism can be a hell of a good way to justify all kinds of bs
[02:16:57] <Satin> I can both criticize Saudi Arabia 's way of treating women as unjust and wrong, with such laws and punishments, but think that the idea of wearing a hijab being commonly associated with decency in their culture isn't necessairly the problem
[02:17:11] <TsundereNoises> and emmeka has some good points here
[02:17:34] <emmeka> does it also take it away from minority religions? sure, but who cares. I don't think random Muslims working for the government are a problem, but I'm also not committed to their supposed right to be a devout Muslim while on the clock as a civil servant
[02:17:38] <Satin> or heavily critizice india's backwards way of treating women as the 2nd gender currently, and all of that, and them needing to liberate but at the same time emphasize the difference in cultural conceptions
[02:17:39] <TsundereNoises> but it's hard to swallow for me, and I'm not sure how I really feel
[02:17:46] <TsundereNoises> which is the BEST KIND of political discussion
[02:17:51] <TsundereNoises> and hasn't happened to me in far too long
[02:17:55] <TsundereNoises> mostly because I talk to idiots
[02:18:12] <Satin> idk it's easy to me
[02:18:14] <Satin> easier*
[02:18:44] <Satin> Quebec government and culture has their thing going on with secularism, and that's ok, as long as it's not used to come down and suppress muslims in general 
[02:19:01] <emmeka> fun Québec secularism fact: Québec bans religious marriages, and also, mandates equality in spousal naming. That is, a wife cannot legally take her husband's name, and keeps her own.
[02:19:05] <Satin> now, if muslims were an even bigger chunk of the population in that region, and there was more history, maybe some more oppression in general
[02:19:06] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I think the issue that gets me with all this is gay rights issues
[02:19:08] <Satin> then that changes things
[02:19:11] <emmeka> all marriages there are civil and secular
[02:19:17] <TsundereNoises> I think there's pretty clearly a moral right
[02:19:19] <emmeka> at least, as far as the paperwork goes
[02:19:39] <Satin> and maybe at that point, this whole secularism stanning stuff is inadeuquate 
[02:19:40] <MootPoot> The name thing is a bit weird 
[02:19:58] <MootPoot> Makes sense to not have name changing like we used to 
[02:20:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I sort of feel like the specific history is a bit irrelevant to what's right and wrong
[02:20:09] <MootPoot> Now that we're more independent I guess 
[02:20:24] <MootPoot> Afaik before it was more of group identifier 
[02:20:28] <emmeka> MootPoot it's not really when you get used to it being the way things are done with francophones. My wife didn't change her name.
[02:20:32] <TsundereNoises> the name thing is like weird but whatever, kind of funny nothing else to me
[02:20:32] <Satin> TsundereNoises: not to me. sometimes it is with things like gay rights, but at other times, history does matter heavily
[02:20:45] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I'm very glad I talked to emmeka about this
[02:21:09] <MootPoot> emmeka: yeah, I get it, but I guess it's more like, before you married the family, and now you marry the person 
[02:21:09] <emmeka> TsundereNoises when that change was made, it was a big deal, considered a major feminist advancement and a huge victory for secularism
[02:21:10] <Satin> movements, identities, are constructed from sometimes myths, but history, and so on
[02:21:51] <Satin> the boundaries of what people feel is right and wrong are governed by those factors as well
[02:21:53] <emmeka> it completely removed religious rule from marriage and turned it into an entirely civil and equal thing
[02:22:00] <MootPoot> Banning martial name changing is a big victory? 
[02:22:06] <MootPoot> Hnm
[02:22:13] * MootPoot shrugs
[02:22:16] <MootPoot> If they say so 
[02:23:35] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I feel like that's relevant to UNDERSTANDING why people do/feel things but that right and wrong are more fundamental than that
[02:23:52] <TsundereNoises> although for IMPLEMENTATION I would agree history is important
[02:24:03] <Satin> not to me, and this is where my postmodernism-ish sense of the world kicks in
[02:24:12] * Satin loops in curves
[02:24:12] <TsundereNoises> and I do think laws should be about practicality, not just morality
[02:24:32] <TsundereNoises> like I'm conceptually fine with the state taking a life, but I'm opposed to the death penalty for practical reasons
[02:24:46] <TsundereNoises> i.e. no sane person can trust our justice system to be infallible
[02:24:50] <Satin> never change though tsun, you believing that is better than me not finding any such fundamental rigid rules that i can hold onto

[04:00:50] <MootPoot> snake: when you built that web scraper, was there a platform you built it off of?
[04:01:03] <snake> node.js
[04:01:16] <snake> and http
[04:01:16] <MootPoot> any guides etc?
[04:01:24] <snake> just the docs
[04:01:28] <MootPoot> node docs
[04:01:29] <MootPoot> okay
[04:01:34] <MootPoot> and you run it locally?
[04:01:41] <MootPoot> browser extension?
[04:01:51] <snake> MootPoot, wanna see how i use a promise and uh callbacks?
[04:01:53] <snake> its very neat
[04:01:58] <snake> nah i just run it from terminal
[04:02:07] <MootPoot> I'mma be legit - I never really got the idea of promises
[04:02:23] <snake> right they are crazy af at first and very difficult to get for some reason
[04:02:39] <snake> i used to write a big fucking mess and just say "shit that's just how promises are" but now i kinda get it
[04:02:52] <MootPoot> I was taught it in class, and tried to do it myself
[04:02:54] <MootPoot> still dont get them
[04:03:02] <snake> basically you need to treat the promise like a value when you're passing it into a function
[04:03:27] <snake> then make the whole function htmlPromise.then(...)
[04:03:38] <snake> like if you were to pass in an html promise for instance
[04:03:48] <MootPoot> your promise becomes a value, and when a function is excuted using that value, your promise fires, and until it returns something your app waits
[04:03:51] <MootPoot> is that it?
[04:04:34] <snake> promise fires when you create it, but essentially yes
[04:04:42] <snake> you make the function that needs your value wait for the value
[04:04:46] <snake> inside the function
[04:04:54] <snake> its prolly clearer with an eggsample
[04:04:56] <snake> from my code
[04:05:09] <MootPoot> snake: so basically
[04:05:13] <MootPoot> fuck promises
[04:05:15] <snake> fuck im working on my essay 4 tho xD its due at midnight
[04:05:17] <MootPoot> its just a async method
[04:05:19] <MootPoot> thats it
[04:05:33] <snake> MootPoot, sometimes they're basically needed
[04:05:46] <snake> and i dont like async/await the words are backwards IMO and so i avoid it
[04:07:15] <snake> hmm if i get 5 pages instead of 6 i wonder if i will still get a B at least
[04:07:49] <snake> MootPoot, i'll talk to you more about this if you want tomorrow, i really need to finish this damn essay LOL
[04:07:51] <snake> im fucked
[04:07:55] <MootPoot> lol
[04:07:57] <MootPoot> go finish it

[04:10:21] <MootPoot> idk why but JS has always been a pain for me
[04:10:33] <snake> its wishy washy
[04:10:34] <MootPoot> its just the syntax - its TOO loose

[05:03:52] <ButterNoodle> I suggest getting off on the hentainet like MootPoot suggested
[05:03:57] <TsundereNoises> but the news just quotes people telling obvious lies without questioning them
[05:04:03] <ButterNoodle> yea
[05:04:04] <TsundereNoises> local news, even worse than national
[05:04:05] <ButterNoodle> thats the news
[05:04:17] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I mean, I think I'd be less annoyed on the hentainet
[05:04:30] <TsundereNoises> I'm trying to find facts in a giant pile of bullshit, that's more annoying
[05:04:53] <ButterNoodle> jfc.. my local news was reporting on a teen that died from a negligent discharge with all kids of wild ass stories a month or so ago..
[05:04:57] <Fenderbassist> TsundereNoises: I feel your pain, it can be so annoying
[05:05:11] <ButterNoodle> its like trying to find the turd in the needle stack

[05:33:22] <Cryowolf> it could still gain power witha  suddenn downburst or what theyre called no?
[05:36:13] <Fenderbassist> Omega037: Lord willing it will not be so bad
[05:36:20] <Fenderbassist> I hope it really weakens a lot
[05:37:05] <Omega037> My house has been standing for 50+ years
[05:37:13] <Omega037> So long as you have a basement, it is fine
[05:37:52] <Cryowolf> what about against f5s? need a powerful basement?

[05:46:38] <TsundereNoises> it's much better when it just stays cold
[05:50:15] * MootPoot is still sorting tabs
[05:50:18] <MootPoot> 500 left
[05:50:21] <MootPoot> out of 740
[05:50:50] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: that's both horrifying and impressive
[05:50:51] <TsundereNoises> congrats
[05:51:08] <TsundereNoises> I clicked it on a whim but this is kind of neat to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lh-jMSpmFA
[05:51:09] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Southern Minnesota Winter Storm Live #IRL 12/10/2021 | Duration: 
[05:51:10] <MootPoot> highest was about 1000 tabs at one point
[05:51:27] <TsundereNoises> I'm proud of you killing half
[05:51:36] <TsundereNoises> I have like 20 tabs open and it's driving me crazy
[05:52:54] <Fenderbassist> yeah that would drive me nuts
[05:52:59] <Fenderbassist> I usually have no more than 3 tabs open
[05:53:15] <Fenderbassist> I don't think my brain could handle remembering what 20-1000 tabs were tracking
[05:53:20] <TsundereNoises> I open more than that momentarily, but Ih ate to have them open long term
[05:53:28] <Fenderbassist> I can understand how you feel
[05:53:41] <TsundereNoises> I frequently open like 10 when they're all links from the same thing I want to check, but then I try to close them asap
[05:53:56] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[05:54:04] <TsundereNoises> and here it went too far
[05:54:15] <TsundereNoises> I have to be careful not to become a Mootpoot
[05:54:34] <MootPoot> well
[05:54:45] <MootPoot> it really depends on what browser and/or what tab management tools you use
[05:55:07] <TsundereNoises> it seems almost psychically heavy
[05:55:18] <MootPoot> opening that many tabs in chrome/chromium? fuck that
[05:55:22] <TsundereNoises> like independent of practical brower or sorting concerns
[05:55:23] <MootPoot> firefire....mehhhh
[05:55:34] <MootPoot> vivaldi and opera?
[05:55:37] <MootPoot> not too bad actually
[05:55:47] <Fenderbassist> Arachnid on DOS :)
[05:55:52] <TsundereNoises> aren't those just chromium
[05:55:53] <Fenderbassist> oh wait, it doesn't have tabs lol
[05:56:09] <TsundereNoises> I don't think I could go back to a tab-free lifestyle
[05:56:17] <MootPoot> well
[05:56:18] <Fenderbassist> ditto, it's too convenient
[05:56:21] <TsundereNoises> they're just too nice for like "which of these 5 options did you REALLY want"
[05:56:26] <TsundereNoises> just open all 5 in a new tab
[05:56:30] <MootPoot> yes- but the "its just chromium" is skippng over what makes them good
[05:56:37] <MootPoot> although firefox is not chromium
[05:56:45] <TsundereNoises> yeah I meant vivaldi and opera
[05:57:22] <MootPoot> They have really good tab management built in
[05:57:35] <MootPoot> While you can get add-ons for the others...it dosent scale well 
[05:58:06] <MootPoot> Beyond like 300 tabs , either the extensions are limited or they just can't handle it 
[05:58:27] <MootPoot> Using the native manager in opera/Vivaldi manages to keep up
[05:59:23] <Cryowolf> I didnt think I'd enjoy a Chinese Man...wa? or is that Korean? Well their anime, Daily Life of the Immortal King

[16:16:01] <Sadale> aw

[16:16:45] <KatrinValerie> Eh, mostly made cash for IBM

[16:18:14] <Sadale> Mine just built shit. He's a construction worker. A manual labor I don't have a problem of having a dad being a manual labor per se. But he's stupid and annoying af. He's a drama king. :<
[16:18:45] <Sadale> He's like a person who's programmed to generate drama in my family. :/
[16:18:59] <KatrinValerie> Sounds exhausting
[16:19:27] <Sadale> yep. For now I'm still tolerating him. If it gets to the point that it's stops worthing to tolerate him, I'd just move out.
[16:19:36] <dfch> Sorry for your loss, kv.
[16:19:49] <KatrinValerie> it brings up mixed feelings
[16:19:50] <Sadale> Moving out is expensive. But mental health is as important. For now I can still tolerate him
[16:20:22] <KatrinValerie> too many bad things happened in the past and his death resurfaced these memories obviously
[16:20:39] <KatrinValerie> been remembering things I wish I had forgotten
[16:20:43] <Sadale> aww :(
[16:20:56] <Sadale> I see. So his death isn't a problem. But the memories associated with that is.
[16:21:01] <Sadale> sad :(
[16:21:25] <Sadale> Funny how I kind of want my stupid dad to die sooner rather than later. xD
[16:21:27] <KatrinValerie> The heart breaking part is that he only harmed me when he was drunk

[16:21:36] <dfch> I can relate, kv, it's... Natural? We are only human.
[16:21:36] <KatrinValerie> he could be a very caring person
[16:22:18] <KatrinValerie> but alcohol always brought out the worst in him

[16:23:10] <dfch> It's ok to pm or not answer at all..
[16:23:16] <KatrinValerie> If I take off all sugar coating, he molested me when I was kindergarten age, I don't remember how long things went on

[16:25:11] <KatrinValerie> yeah and lots of guilt associated with that, but at least there's an explanation for why that happened I guess?
[16:25:15] <KatrinValerie> not that it makes things better
[16:25:40] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, now that he's dead. You couldn't ask him anymore. :/
[16:25:49] <KatrinValerie> About what?
[16:26:03] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, your dad molesting you
[16:26:06] <KatrinValerie> I don't think he remembered any of the things he did to me
[16:26:19] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, Perhaps you could ask someone else in your family tho. I mean he's dead. So he can't get jailed for that.
[16:26:24] <KatrinValerie> he'd only do that when he was so drunk that he'd recall nothing the next day
[16:26:32] <Sadale> oh wow
[16:26:43] <Sadale> It sounds so wrong. But he's drunk so w/e :/

[20:57:34] <MootPoot> I dont know why, but low fps 3dcg looks so much worse then nomal 2d anime
[20:57:51] <MootPoot> even though both are pretty low
[20:58:02] <Miyukii> 3dcg in cheap modern anime is truly a plague
[20:58:23] <Miyukii> I'd rather have the old fashioned powerpoint slides if they're gonna cheap out
[20:58:25] <MootPoot> I'm okay with 3dcg as well, but jesus its 2021 crank up the fidelity and FPS
[20:58:58] <Miyukii> same with cheap copypasted 3d models as background crowd
[20:59:16] <MootPoot> ^ Im okay with that
[20:59:21] <MootPoot> easy to ignore
[20:59:27] <MootPoot> if it reduces production costs 
[20:59:33] <Miyukii> MootPoot, that means they can't use that Core2Duo they found in a dumpster for rendering their anime

[21:00:03] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Muteking the Dancing Hero | Episode: 11
[21:00:05] <MootPoot> all of japan's anime production is probably still running on a pentium 4 with the integer calculation fault
[21:00:19] <Miyukii> 3dcg when done right can be just fine, even without a high budget
[21:00:29] <Miyukii> or back when the technology and computers were shit
[21:00:40] <pepper> 2nd animators have an intuitive sense of motion and how to convey it with limited frames, with 3d you have to translate that without being able to tap into that
[21:00:51] <MootPoot> fucking hentai artists in their basement are completely outclassing the japanese corporate 3dcg artists
[21:01:28] <pepper> :s/2nd/2d

[21:19:55] <KatrinValerie> Glad I am not operating anything with apache on it
[21:19:57] <KatrinValerie> hopefully
[21:20:00] <KatrinValerie> who knows
[21:20:09] <KatrinValerie> oh good grief it might be on my router
[21:20:15] <ButterNoodle> lol
[21:20:30] <ButterNoodle> never expose anything to the public without WAF
[21:20:39] <ButterNoodle> idc what ur runnin
[21:21:09] <ButterNoodle> although apache is a sieve out of the box
[21:21:48] <ButterNoodle> apparently apache doesnt know how to patch.. 
[21:22:14] <ButterNoodle> guess I need to update my IDS too
[21:22:37] <KatrinValerie> nah it doesn't
[21:22:52] <MootPoot> So apparently....my router has a function to allow access remotely to my network for a specific device 
[21:22:54] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: I have been using nginx for years because of that
[21:22:59] <MootPoot> Remotely as in outside of my network 
[21:23:04] <KatrinValerie> the apache project has been slow for ages
[21:23:07] <MootPoot> Kinda kowaii to turn it on 
[21:23:13] <ButterNoodle> thats doesnt render it useless
[21:23:16] <KatrinValerie> and honestly the configuration is not friendly
[21:23:18] <ButterNoodle> I use both
[21:23:22] <MootPoot> render some beef
[21:23:23] <ButterNoodle> wtf..
[21:23:32] <ButterNoodle> nginx config is dog shit
[21:23:39] <ButterNoodle> ig its all what u know tbh
[21:23:41] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: I find nginx config very easy
[21:23:52] <MootPoot> nginx is meh
[21:23:54] <KatrinValerie> apache was hard to learn when I was 13
[21:23:56] <ButterNoodle> same for apache w me
[21:24:20] <ButterNoodle> I've been using apache longer.. so theres that..
[21:24:23] <KatrinValerie> I installed sql lite
[21:24:25] <KatrinValerie> and php
[21:24:28] <KatrinValerie> and apache
[21:24:37] <KatrinValerie> boom my first own webserver
[21:24:42] <ButterNoodle> I wont say one is better than the other.. they both have different things they are very good at..
[21:24:46] <ButterNoodle> hence I run both
[21:24:53] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: i have used apache much longer than nginx
[21:25:19] <KatrinValerie> but when I returned to webservers after a long break and looked at apache vs nginx, ngingx just won out
[21:25:21] <ButterNoodle> for dynamic pure web and java stuffs.. I run that on apache
[21:25:59] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: my stack consists of uwsgi running python scripts and nginx integrates with that nicely
[21:26:03] <ButterNoodle> I use nginx for proxy/reverse-proxy/load balancing/light dynamic pages
[21:26:21] <ButterNoodle> tbh for my personal use.. nginx is fine these days
[21:26:39] <ButterNoodle> u can run modsecurity on it
[21:26:44] <ButterNoodle> so u got waf
[21:26:56] <ButterNoodle> that was the big prob I had w nginx for years
[21:27:21] <ButterNoodle> there may be a day that I just use nginx on public facing servers..
[21:27:55] <KatrinValerie> yeah my nginx proxies stuff to the uwsgi thingy
[21:28:13] <KatrinValerie> and then my python application consumes the http requests
[21:28:21] <ButterNoodle> pretty bad ass for that
[21:28:26] <ButterNoodle> and terminating SSL..
[21:29:11] <KatrinValerie> setting up ssl with nginx is not hard compared to apache, but maybe it is just because I used apache when I was younger and less experienced
[21:29:31] <ButterNoodle> I'm a big F5 guy, so nginx is lil brudder to an actual load balancer
[21:29:41] <ButterNoodle> yea its no different
[21:29:56] <ButterNoodle> the hardest thing to get around on nginx is cgi..
[21:30:51] <ButterNoodle> apache lets u run cgi in the the same memory space with the server iirc out of the box, but you actually should be setting it up the same PITA way as nginx
[21:31:15] <ButterNoodle> and that is most of the complaints I hear about nginx setup
[21:31:47] <ButterNoodle> I do think nginx's resource model is quite a bit more efficient
[21:32:03] <ButterNoodle> cant say I have OOM'd a nginx box
[21:33:49] <KatrinValerie> The project I was working on was supposed to be really scaleable
[21:33:56] <KatrinValerie> so nginx was a natural choice
[21:33:58] <MootPoot> cum is areally scalable
[21:34:03] <MootPoot> really*
[21:34:07] <KatrinValerie> scaling apache looked much more complex

[23:00:25] <Fenderbassist> big congrats
[23:00:46] <Fenderbassist> two pistols that can share magazines
[23:00:47] <ButterNoodle> yea going to look at it in a bit..
[23:01:04] <ButterNoodle> :| I have more than 2 p220s
[23:01:07] <ButterNoodle> slready
[23:01:21] <Fenderbassist> so now you will want 20 magazines :)
[23:01:32] <ButterNoodle> yes.. I think I have 10
[23:01:45] <Fenderbassist> what a fantastic pistol to have several of
[23:01:52] <MootPoot> wha
[23:01:55] <MootPoot> I want a sig
[23:01:56] <ButterNoodle> ik.. I want more 226s tbh
[23:02:06] <ButterNoodle> but they are not in the lords caliber
[23:02:23] <ButterNoodle> I have a bunch of mecgar stainless mags to go with them
[23:02:25] <Fenderbassist> go with what works for you
[23:02:32] <Fenderbassist> cool
[23:02:46] <ButterNoodle> I dont think I would carry a 220, but they are awesome to shoot at the range
[23:03:03] <Fenderbassist> it makes you happy, that's what counts
[23:03:07] <ButterNoodle> I have carried my 220 equinox -some-
[23:03:15] <Fenderbassist> I just bought my fifth and sixth P bass, same reason
[23:03:29] <ButterNoodle> yes.. do what feels good and makes u happy :)
[23:03:41] <Fenderbassist> plus I need a functional pair while the "mains" have the fret ends dressed
[23:03:58] <Fenderbassist> (they are starting to stick out of the sides of the neck due to wood shrinkage from being in desert)
[23:04:10] <ButterNoodle> be careful.. you'll want ur backups to be pimped out like ur daily drivers
[23:04:18] <Fenderbassist> like little daggers lol
[23:04:21] <Fenderbassist> hehe
[23:04:21] <ButterNoodle> woah
[23:04:32] <Fenderbassist> fortunately they came stock just the way I want them
[23:04:41] <Fenderbassist> the parts builds are the ones I had to pick and choose stuff
[23:04:51] <Fenderbassist> and need those fret ends cut
[23:04:56] <Fenderbassist> well, filed
[23:05:00] <ButterNoodle> thats always been my issue with guitars..
[23:05:03] <Fenderbassist> filed down to match the wood
[23:05:12] <ButterNoodle> do I buy already ready.. or pimp out
[23:05:28] <ButterNoodle> I still want an explorer..
[23:05:28] <Fenderbassist> it's fun both ways
[23:05:34] <Fenderbassist> a Gibson or an Epiphone?
[23:05:52] <Fenderbassist> Gib$$$$$$ons cost
[23:05:57] <ButterNoodle> but do I buy the epi and give it the emg 81/85 treatment.. or get a gibson and keep it factory..
[23:05:59] <Fenderbassist> Ephiphones very affordable
[23:06:14] <Fenderbassist> I'd do Epi first
[23:06:17] <ButterNoodle> yea the gib is still probably $4-500 more
[23:06:17] <Fenderbassist> and see how often you play it
[23:06:29] <Fenderbassist> or even more than that with the limited supply
[23:06:34] <Fenderbassist> prices are going up up up up up
[23:06:35] <ButterNoodle> thats the problem.. I dont play anymore so I cant justify either O.O
[23:06:47] <Fenderbassist> get an Epi if you want something for fun
[23:06:49] <Fenderbassist> play it stock
[23:07:03] <Fenderbassist> and then if it still has your interest, install the EMG pickups and board
[23:07:16] <ButterNoodle> I mean even a shit piece dean would sound awesome with emg kit in it
[23:07:18] <ButterNoodle> but
[23:07:43] <ButterNoodle> would rather have the explorer.. and tbh the firebird would trump that
[23:07:43] <Fenderbassist> sometimes having the item sparks the hobby renewal
[23:08:10] <Fenderbassist> doesn't seem like money is an issue for you
[23:08:17] <Fenderbassist> well paid technology professional
[23:08:37] <Fenderbassist> I'm buying now cause the prices are projected to go up quite a bit again
[23:08:44] <ButterNoodle> it does.. may waste some bonus monies this year and pick up something new
[23:08:49] <ButterNoodle> still have my strat
[23:08:50] <Fenderbassist> the models I just got will go up a few hundred more each by end of next year
[23:08:54] <ButterNoodle> woah
[23:09:00] <ButterNoodle> supply/demand?
[23:09:02] <Fenderbassist> yes
[23:09:05] <Fenderbassist> and also Fender
[23:09:09] <ButterNoodle> tru
[23:10:27] <Fenderbassist> I play P basses...whether Punk, Garage Rock, Blues, Soul, New Wave, Alternative, Rockabilly or Standards
[23:10:43] <Fenderbassist> the gig determines which string versions I take
[23:10:53] <Fenderbassist> flat wounds or round wounds
[23:11:33] <Fenderbassist> kind of like how your outings determine what caliber and platform you take
[23:12:09] <Fenderbassist> do you ever play your Strat?
[23:12:47] <Fenderbassist> I know you said you "don't play anymore" but I imagine you pick the Strat up now and then

[23:16:40] <isekaijin> Has anyone here tried the M1 MacBook Pro? If so, is it worth the price?
[23:17:35] <Fenderbassist> sorry I haven't
[23:17:48] <Fenderbassist> there has to be plenty of reviews on YouTube, I imagine
