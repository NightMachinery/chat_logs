[00:37:32] <d3ph4u1769> if that's even a word lol

[01:41:57] <horseface> now i never play games, so is this useless?
[01:42:27] <luigibu> but grub mounted sdc3.. instead of sda2

[03:22:21] <tusko> I'm making the assumption (big) its not a network issue or something else specific to them
[03:23:08] <rcf> I'm absolutely certain it's not a network issue. However, I suspect their git configuration is at fault. 
[03:23:18] <tusko> I share your suspicion.

[03:25:16] <rcf> It's great... but you need to have that working knowledge of the AUR before using it. 
[03:25:44] <tusko> I agree. The ABS is legit. I just wish I understood how to manage updates better using only ABS.
[03:26:49] <rcf> Because the AUR is 1) a big gigantic pile of crap (and I say that as someone who packages things there), anyone can publish whatever and malicious things have been pushed in the past and 2) automating a turing-complete packaging setup is prone to failure by its very nature, and manual meddling will be required at some point 
[03:27:20] <nothereisnotanam> only use full if you have a considarable amount arch linux installs, and they arent powerfull enough for fast compiles, otherwise its not worth the effort
[03:27:31] <nothereisnotanam> rcf: well made packages dont use turring complete features
[03:27:48] <nothereisnotanam> but arch should have used a non turring complete dsl for PKGBUILDS, not bash

[03:31:34] <rcf> nothereisnotanam: they do, but if you are using one to hide the details (as it is suggested here), you don't know what a PKGBUILD even is. 
[03:31:57] <tusko> Well, hopefully everyone uses the ABS before they ever use an AUR helper.
[03:32:31] <tusko> So they'd at least know the PKGBUILD exists.
[03:32:31] <rcf> tusko: relevant to the problem at hand: get them to clone one of the AUR repos and pull from it without issue. Ignore building; make sure git works.

[06:47:47] <vd> that XDG spec is so stupid
[06:50:06] <vd> my conclusion back then was to unfortunately remove ~/.<shell>_profile and rely on ~/.profile which must be read from every places.

[07:27:25] <jbox> I might as well go through the install process again in regards to /boot

[07:29:24] *** Quits: tastenquaeler_ (~horst@gateway/tor-sasl/tastenquaeler) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[07:29:40] <lolok> this is why i like grub, if it cant find your /boot, yo can tell it where to look from its own shell
[07:30:05] <jbox> I'm using grub
[07:31:27] <jbox> I think this is part of the boot process, past the bootloader. I've already selected the grub menuentry and the display reset like it does at the beginning of the boot process (when it shows the splash)
[07:31:42] <twistero> so it's the kernel + initrd not being able to mount /boot?
[07:32:01] <twistero> maybe the initrd does not have correct drivers for the virtual disk
[07:32:10] <jbox> I know nothing about initrd so I don't know, sorry
[07:32:32] <twistero> you're seeing kernel logs, right?
[07:32:37] <jbox> I'm not using a virtual disk right now. I'm just booting it straight from my motherboard bios at the moment
[07:32:41] <Scimmia> the initramfs should not be mounting /boot at all
[07:33:38] <twistero> we should first pinpoint which step it's being stuck on
[07:33:51] <hexology> how much space does a typical base system installation take up nowadays?
[07:33:56] <lolok> add to the 'linux' line in your arcg grub menu entry 'systemd.debug-shell' and you should get a root shell on tty9, you can use that to fix fstab
[07:34:04] <lolok> arch*
[07:34:13] <jbox> I'm now booted into the archiso, chrooted into my install, and I manually mounted /boot just fine
[07:35:25] <lolok> so genfstab again

[08:55:43] <et09> then it prob gives you a bearer token or something
[08:55:57] <ponies> yeah it wont work though

[09:03:34] <et09> yeah that was my q 
[09:03:38] <et09> does thunderbird just have a single client id
[09:03:42] <grawity> yes
[09:03:59] <et09> not across every installation i hope
[09:04:03] <grawity> it does, why not
[09:04:17] <grawity> it's not much of a security issue, it doesn't become part of the actual bearer token
[09:04:24] <et09> ah, ic
[09:04:45] <et09> so i could literally use theirs lol
[09:04:47] <grawity> the "client secret" being public has some issues, but desktop clients use PKCE to avoid that

[11:32:43] <grawity> why not use 1.1.1.1 over DoH for connections that are in chromium, too?

[14:28:57] <bladerunner567> And I think it's odd to show 4.48GB? 
[14:29:18] <mpan> Perhaps I am blind, so someone else should take a look. But to me it seems like system is having not enough RAM.
[14:29:25] <mpan> bladerunner567: because you are supposed to have 8GiB, right?
[14:29:30] <tirnanog> baltazar: I don't think there's anything you can do about it, as far as the hardware is concerned. if it bothers you, consider booting with loglevel=3 so that only critical messages are printed to the console. you'll still be able to see all the messages in the kernel ring buffer.
[14:29:40] <mpan> So the highest available address should be around 8GiB. Not 4.48GiB.

[14:30:56] <baltazar> tirnanog: meh, ok
[14:31:15] <mpan> bladerunner567: and that is literally what the operating system receives while asking BIOS to provide it with available memory maps.
[14:31:40] <tirnanog> baltazar: in short, it doesn't divulge the mode of caching, if any, and the kernel logs that at KERN_ERR llevel, for better or worse.
[14:31:45] <bladerunner567> So the problem relies somewhere in kernel?

[17:04:33] <thurstylark> it's part of the spec
[17:05:11] <luigibu> but the boot->grub folder is also part of the EFI?
[17:05:38] <thurstylark> yes. one is the default bootloader path which will work in case you lose your nvram entries that point to the grub-specific one

[17:07:34] <luigibu> i thought efi was mounted at boot->efi.. and that boot->grub was local

[17:07:46] <grawity> and some people do that on arch, too
[17:08:09] <thurstylark> which is why I was asking where your esp was mounted previous to your hard drive move

[17:08:40] <luigibu> thansk!

[21:33:34] <phrik> Try It And See™
[21:33:48] <lmat> I selected how I want to connect to a LAN game: TCP/IP. I was surprised to find that whitelisting the (TCP) port was insufficient to get the game going and it uses UDP as well. I mentioned that this game lies: it doesn't just use TCP/IP, it also uses UDP. Someone corrected me: "TCP/IP is a protocol suit and TCP and UDP are specific protocols of this suit." I've worked with networking stacks for a long 
[21:33:54] <lmat> time, but I've never heard it put this way. Is this accurate?
[21:34:03] <mcoffin> teraflops: I tried there, but I think it fell off their radar. I'm having issues getting proton to choose the right "runtime" container environment (to make sure I'm not running the BattlEye one) ever since the anti-cheat-compatible-containers stuff has come out. It seems to be chosen on an application-by-application basis, and as far as I can tell, is not forceable by me at runtime
[21:34:16] <teraflops> oh I see
[21:34:41] <thurstylark> lmat: that's pretty consistent with my experience
[21:35:06] <lmat> thurstylark: What is? That "UDP" is "part of" "TCP/IP"?
[21:35:20] <lmat> thurstylark: Or that people say that it is? ;-)
[21:36:05] <mcoffin> So, it's running things in an anti-cheat container (lord knows why... I'd pay to know), so it won't let me load some of the addons/plugins that I'm developing, and I stopped trying for fear of running amok of the automated banning system(s) - I can't imagine they made it un-changeable, I just need to know what part of the system is deciding what environment to use, because it seems liek the mere 
[21:36:11] <mcoffin> presence of the battleye runtime envrionment on my system's disk causes changes in behavior, which is *not* what I was looking for

[23:12:58] <teraflops> a bit of mescaline and spongebob is fun 
[23:13:00] <vd> thurstylark that'd be similar to moving stuffs in /home/previouswork, /home/currentwork. no perms fuckery (after chown -R for sure) and things are still accessible out of sight in your $HOME.

[23:13:49] <thurstylark> yeah, then snapshots (btrfs or otherwise) is how people usually do this
[23:13:49] <vd> accessible but* out of sight
[23:14:20] <vd> thurstylark moving to btrfs is actually the reason why I'm thinking about all of this :D

[23:15:17] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52)
[23:16:00] <thurstylark> plus, snapshots don't include child subvols, so, for instance, if you wanted to exclude ~/.cache from your snapshots, then just make a subvol there, and your ~ snapshots won't contain anything under the ~/.cache subvol
[23:16:07] <vd> so I was like let's split "identities" stuffs first, move them out of my current $HOME logic, then eventually subvol/snapshot them later.
[23:17:44] <vd> thurstylark good point, exactly why I wanted to have siblings for "identities", because nested subvolumes are great for snapshot barriers (aka don't care) but a bit harder to manage for subvolumes you care about.

[23:47:55] *** Joins: Namarrgon (~Namarrgon@archlinux/op/Namarrgon)
[23:48:38] <kek_> BrainDamage, I mean if I set it by hand then it's okay but the installation guide doesn't mention having to set that. I thought set-ntp should sync that. I'm on windows ual boot. So atm I just set it by hand.
[23:49:01] <tirnanog> I think you misunderstand.
[23:49:04] <thurstylark> you should have also set the timezone with a symlink
[23:49:19] <tirnanog> the clock should be set to the UTC time so it probably is, in fact, correct.
[23:49:20] <thurstylark> ntp doesn't do timezone stuff for you

[23:50:05] <thurstylark> oh, like in the install iso?
[23:50:19] <tirnanog> i.e. if you want to 'see' CET, that comes as a result of defining the timezone. but your clock isn't necessarily wrong.

[23:57:44] <tirnanog> kek_: yes, you are. timezone adjustment is performed in accordance with the definition of /etc/timezone. and there's no particular need to fiddle with /etc/timezone in the live environment. once you've arch-chrooted, that's when it matters.
[23:57:54] <tirnanog> /etc/localtime, rather.
[23:58:03] <thurstylark> as long as `timedatectl` returns "System clock synchronized: yes" you should be fine to continue
[23:58:13] <tirnanog> the goal is to get the system clock right and, in so far as you've done so, just carry on.
[23:58:33] <thurstylark> linux doesn't care about local time zone like windows does
[23:58:53] <kek_> ah, that's the point of the exercise here. I admit, I don't know much about clocks in computers.
[23:58:54] <thurstylark> it calculates from UTC pretty much everywhere
[23:59:07] <thurstylark> np, that's why we're here :)
[23:59:25] <kek_> yeah I was just expecting it to show me the correct timezone (in utc, cet or whatever)
[23:59:44] <kek_> so what exactly gets synced here? hardward and "software" clock?
[23:59:57] <tirnanog> I mean, if it really bothered you from without the chroot, you could "export TZ=CET" there.
[23:59:58] <thurstylark> your hardware clock is synced with the time server
