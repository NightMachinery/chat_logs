[08:49:47] <kjani> jaafar: What distro ??
[08:49:48] <fsbot> Signs point to yes!
[08:49:49] <jaafar> I think I did it previously because I was helping test
[08:49:59] <jaafar> Ubuntu
[08:50:09] <kjani> Me too but I have emacs 29
[08:50:16] <kjani> Using the emacs-snapshot ppa
[08:50:18] <jaafar> yeah ubuntu is 26.3 now for some reason
[08:50:22] <jaafar> 29? what?
[08:50:25] <jaafar> did they release 28?
[08:50:30] <kjani> Yeah the emacs-snapshot ppa
[08:50:59] <kjani> jaafar: they did not release 28, if you build from source using the git branch the version number there is 29
[08:51:19] <kjani> That is why I said I use 29 but the PPA has helped me a lot
[08:51:31] <jaafar> ah yes OK https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Latest-version-of-Emacs.html
[08:51:54] <jaafar> I love emacs but it's such a central tool for me that I can't experiment much
[08:52:03] <jaafar> so "latest stable" is going to be my thing
[08:52:13] <jaafar> hence 27.2
[08:52:18] <homerj> jaafar: yes
[08:52:47] <homerj> I have an opinion that if various git and beta versions of software actually worked correctly, they wouldn't be git and beta versions, just the next stable one

[11:10:26] <schurig> probably nmcli or the network manager GUI has a way to delete PPPoE connections again ...

[21:07:03] <corwin> bremner: pretty much the IRC way, i guess.  Hence my plan is to feed my private logs to comicchat and restrict access to those channels using a bearer token issued by the IRC bot that feels "live" chat into the comicchat server.
