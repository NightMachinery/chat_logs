[21:47:24] <ham5urg> I want to restrict downloads to 720p or less (247). Is there a automatic way?
[21:53:48] <macaw> Apparently there is. I haven't used it, so not much help from me except for:
[21:54:25] <macaw> https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md mentions `You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in -f "best[height=720]" (or -f "[filesize>10M]")`.
[21:55:04] <ham5urg> Thanks
[21:56:23] <macaw> No problem. :)
[21:56:38] <ham5urg> Are all YT videos available in webM?

[21:57:38] <ham5urg> I've read this https://superuser.com/questions/503868/how-i-can-remove-all-google-data-from-youtube-video-downloads and would use webM if all is available in webM
[21:57:54] <macaw> There was some format that wasn't always available, but I'm unsure which one it was. Whether it was webm, mp4 or something else.
[21:58:56] <ede> ham5urg: i've seen some formats listed in yt-dlp with filesize missing, seems they are not available. or maybe yt-dlp just fails reading the address or something, didn't check it yet (wanted to do it systematically).
[21:59:24] <macaw> Webm seems like it _should_ be available everywhere, as it's Google's darling.
[22:00:05] <ham5urg> I'm unsure in choosing the best format. Idk what has to be considered.
[22:01:04] <ede> i had to get mp4 a few times (just remind it, can't name any particular video now), but with the throttling i use yt-dlp on youtube. i may check it next time when i think of it, or maybe i just should script something, hm.
[22:01:33] <ede> "best" is subjective. quality, artefacts, filesize, handling in the player, ....
[22:02:19] <ede> like they replace jpeg with webp, but i've read a blogpost about the format being smaller maybe, but not really better quality.
[22:03:13] <ham5urg> availibility of content and availibility of opensource decoder libraries are my preferences
[22:03:47] <ede> also, in mp4: avc1 vs av01. better compression usually means more work while uncompressing. had this problem already when debian switched from bzip2 to xz for the file package in .deb.
[22:03:52] <ede> *nod*
[22:04:23] <ede> was the reason why i never bought an mp3 player, though i would have liked to have something replacing my (even then) old walkman :)

[22:04:28] <ham5urg> if all is in webm and ffmpeg or vlc will play without unfree libs, I would choose it.

[22:14:27] <ham5urg> When I do something like this https://paste.debian.net/1222153/ , I get many formats. Is there something I can add to get only one format?
[22:29:41] <ede> ham5urg: what do you mean with "many formats"? looks like video+audio => file.
[22:30:58] <ham5urg> It looks like many files like ...f136.mp4 are created but are vanishing later. Only the one stays what is good. But at the first view it was unclear
[22:31:47] <ede> ah this. yes, do a -F on the url, that's the (temporary) file in a particular format. usually gets muxed later.
[22:33:03] <ede> also, just as a sidenote: they advise against using CAPITAL ONLY variables because of the risk of clashes with those from the env.
[22:33:55] <ham5urg> Could youtube-dl identify already downloaded files which have a different name? So just rename it, not download it. 
[22:35:03] <ede> to avoid downloading something you have already?
[22:35:30] <ham5urg> Yes
[22:35:51] <ede> that's why i use the ID for the filename ;)
[22:36:43] <ham5urg> I forgot that YT alters every file. A checksum is not usable.
[22:37:10] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: ars longa vita brevis)
[22:37:10] <ede> also because of json and jpeg and cut files (though can't remember how it works in mpv, but it does) which maybe are made from the comment i keep them in a directory also with the id as name
[22:37:34] <ede> depends, but fixing broken bitstreams seems to be popular
[22:38:17] <ede> also with your url being part of the download url at that moment... maybe after demuxing, not sure.
[22:39:16] <ede> i had to restart downloads a few times already, not even the JSON is granted to be the same, if it's just reordering the structures for the individual formats only.

[23:06:17] <ede> jq <$json '.title'

[23:30:44] <ede> sounds like a media center thing, also afaik mpv has a directory browser addon already implemented in JS
[23:32:09] <ede> in the past i used tvbrowser.org and mediathekview, but both java and atm i don't feel like going back to it.
