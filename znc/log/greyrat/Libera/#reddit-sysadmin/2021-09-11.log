[10:19:38] <dragonfleas> man the 1gb droplets from digital ocean are not well equipped to run complicated web servers
[10:19:56] <dragonfleas> anyone have any other vps hosts that are cheaper and have better performance?
[10:20:02] <dragonfleas> should i go back to vultr?
[10:21:01] <dragonfleas> wtf vultr has managed k8s now
[10:21:06] <dragonfleas> they've grown up so fast
[10:25:54] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: you're alive?
[10:26:18] <dragonfleas> ya
[10:26:28] <JollyRgrs> how many jobs you had this last year?
[10:26:36] <dragonfleas> 2
[10:26:42] <JollyRgrs> slowing down, eh?
[10:26:53] <JollyRgrs> also, what kind of "complicated" web servers are you talking about?
[10:27:20] <dragonfleas> this basic 1gb 1 basic cpu droplet can't even handle me being in vscode ssh remote
[10:27:30] <dragonfleas> i ran npm ci and it completely crashed
[10:27:38] <JollyRgrs> for the most part anything past serving static or barely dynamic pages enters the realm of "application server" to me... an application that may or may not have a web frontend
[10:27:40] <JollyRgrs> lol
[10:27:42] <dragonfleas> i'm going to have to bump it up to intel premium & 2gb lol
[10:27:49] <JollyRgrs> why are you doing that?
[10:28:01] <JollyRgrs> run vscode locally and have it connect to your remote system via ssh
[10:28:06] <dragonfleas> it is
[10:28:18] <JollyRgrs> oh, i thought you were X tunneling into the host
[10:28:27] <dragonfleas> nah i got vscode remote ssh setup
[10:28:36] <dragonfleas> it's pretty cool
[10:28:41] <dragonfleas> vscode server or w/e the feature is
[10:29:05] <dragonfleas> the only thing i don't like is the basic source control feature set you get on the sidebar
[10:29:27] <dragonfleas> basically you can commit and that's it, pushes, connecting to remotes, etc, all go back to commandline
[10:30:11] <JollyRgrs> if you're trying to run everything automated, just do all your code in git and have your server pull it down?
[10:30:26] <dragonfleas> that's already done
[10:30:39] <dragonfleas> it's the building from dynamic to static content that's capping CPU and installing node-modules
[10:30:54] <dragonfleas> straight up it doesn't have a good time lol
[10:33:31] <JollyRgrs> well, those super cheap VMs aren't made for compute, they're just made for serve
[10:33:36] <JollyRgrs> you get what you pay for
[10:33:52] <JollyRgrs> you're rentin a raspi, at best
[10:33:59] <dragonfleas> i know, i can build on my machine and push it up, it's just easier if i can clone -> build -> serve
[10:34:18] <dragonfleas> i might just get a beefy ass baremetal from soyoustart
[10:34:37] <dragonfleas> i just like the simplicity of using these vps services
[10:34:47] <dragonfleas> way less overhead

[11:38:03] <dragonfleas> netim is an awful dns provider
[11:38:13] <dragonfleas> i bought a slovenian domain from them because i couldn't find anywhere else to buy one LOL
[11:38:58] <dragonfleas> they literally don't let you set your TTL under 24 hours
[11:39:07] <dragonfleas> that is fucking awful
[11:39:27] <dragonfleas> sea, i wrote the api lol
[11:40:29] <pcspkr> could have bought from gandi
[11:40:35] <pcspkr> tho it's a special price even there
[11:40:42] <JollyRgrs> wait what?
[11:40:58] <JollyRgrs> you couldn't find anywhere on the world wide web to buy a domain except from netim?
[11:41:18] <dragonfleas> for slovenian domains, everywhere else was WAY overpriced
[11:41:21] <JollyRgrs> or were you specifically needing a slovenian domain?
[11:41:28] <dragonfleas> specifically needing a slovenian one
[11:41:42] <pcspkr> why is that though

[12:02:06] <Hunterkll> to give you an idea
[12:02:12] <Hunterkll> they made OVH look god-tier super good

[12:02:26] <Activ8> mmm bacon n onion n egg sandwich n a cuppa. YAWN ü•± 
[12:04:14] <Cl0udNinja> uhg tryin to figure out this fucking code is making me rage
[12:04:20] <dragonfleas> JollyRgrs, no i wrote this in a weekend lol, i haven't bought the cert yet
[12:04:28] <Cl0udNinja> LETS MAKE A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND NOT DOCUMENT A SINGLE FUCKING BIT OF IT
[12:06:38] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: uh... you gonna pay for a cert for a thing like that?
[12:06:38] <Activ8> Documentation what‚Äôs that boss
[12:06:43] <Cl0udNinja> heh
[12:06:54] <dragonfleas> i guess i could letsencrypt right
[12:06:56] <dragonfleas> those are free
[12:06:57] <JollyRgrs> also... what is vinesauce?
[12:07:08] <JollyRgrs> yeah. LE for sure
[12:07:11] <dragonfleas> it's like a streamer community
[12:07:15] <JollyRgrs> why would you ever pay for a chump site?
[12:07:32] <JollyRgrs> a streamer on twitch who got his start on vine?
[12:07:41] <dragonfleas> nah, he was around way before vine
[12:08:08] <dragonfleas> this is my first time setting up letsencrypt so let's see how it goes lol
[12:08:34] <dragonfleas> the certbot thing i mean
[12:08:48] <JollyRgrs> oh... "Vincent "Funny Calzone Man" Pizzapasta (born May 12, 1985) is the founder of Vinesauce. He is known for his Corruption Videos, Tomodachi Life streams, and Shovelware Showcase."
[12:08:55] <JollyRgrs> so... someone i hsouldn't care about at all
[12:09:03] <JollyRgrs> also yeah, certbot is pretty basic/ez stuff
[12:09:15] <JollyRgrs> just use the testing/non-prod cert thing first
[12:09:34] <JollyRgrs> LE doesn't let you pull a new cert every 2 minutes... so test in test, then change to prod when you got your config settled
[12:09:38] <Activ8> Nah jump straight in there nothing needs testing
[12:10:07] <Activ8> were in real life not simulation lol
[12:10:37] <dragonfleas> >vincent pizzapasta LMAO
[12:13:43] <Activ8> haha
[12:13:54] <Activ8> Docker Engine starting...
[12:14:05] <dragonfleas> yeah i'm not seeing anything that allows me to get a test cert with certbot, and i'm reading through all their docs
[12:14:33] <Activ8> meh you don't need test certs man just bang em in and cross ya fingers n toes
[12:15:02] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/
[12:15:13] <dragonfleas> oh it's not on the certbot website
[12:15:17] <JollyRgrs> If you‚Äôre using Certbot, you can use our staging environment with the --dry-run flag.
[12:15:28] <JollyRgrs> i said LE doesn't like it
[12:15:37] <JollyRgrs> certbot doesn't care how many times you run their script, it's just a .sh
[12:16:03] <dragonfleas> i'm gonna switch hosts first lol
[12:16:08] <dragonfleas> digital ocean is garbage doo doo stinky
[12:16:18] <dragonfleas> idk where i should move it but i'll find somewhere
[12:16:22] <Cl0udNinja> speaking of hosts and such
[12:16:25] <Cl0udNinja> GCP.. is the suck
[12:16:55] <Cl0udNinja> this week was my first week ever diving into GCP, and I've not had this many complaints about a product/platform since the beginning of my IT career
[12:16:56] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: you looked into hosting with MikeSpears?
[12:17:19] <Activ8> what's MikeSpears hosting website
[12:17:25] <Cl0udNinja> gibbyfarts.com
[12:17:26] <Hunterkll> i'd rather GCP than DO 
[12:17:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:17:30] <MikeSpears> I'm redeveloping things right now
[12:17:43] <Hunterkll> at least GCP doesn't go down like cryptic1 if you wave a quarter in his face
[12:17:44] <JollyRgrs> Activ8: i cba to remember, but MikeSpears should be able to tell ya

[12:18:45] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, true though, I would rather GCP than DO, but... GCP is just fucking ridiculous... like.. for google being google, they sure as shit did a terrible job with GCPs functionality
[12:19:07] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: they prob had a specific thing in mind and if you are outside of that, the workflow might be trash?
[12:19:07] <dragonfleas> i might just go "serverless"

[12:19:11] <JollyRgrs> who knows
[12:19:28] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, yeah thats pretty much it... and like, its just in general trash imo
[12:19:33] <Cl0udNinja> its all fucking qemu kvms
[12:19:38] <JollyRgrs> i didn't use google for a DNS registrar for a reason (also, it's "beta" who knows when it'll get yanked)
[12:19:41] <Activ8> oh dear
[12:19:43] <Activ8> https://i.imgur.com/CQcZ4VZ.png
[12:19:53] <Activ8> do I really have to fill this in before accessing a website
[12:20:01] <Cl0udNinja> Activ8, lol
[12:20:03] <Activ8> that's worse than GDPR popups
[12:20:05] <Activ8> :(
[12:20:06] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: that's what i used to run... i mean, i still do but now i manage them via proxmox b/c i was tired of doing it manually from cli
[12:20:20] <JollyRgrs> Activ8: lol i hate those
[12:20:21] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, sure, thats fine, but like, a 'huge' cloud provider..
[12:20:26] <Activ8> I'll do this just once mike, just once
[12:20:34] <Activ8> next time I get that it's getting a big fat X
[12:20:34] <Cl0udNinja> who charges the same amount, or more than AWS for a fucking qemu kvm
[12:20:38] <Cl0udNinja> gtfo with that shit
[12:20:45] <JollyRgrs> lol
[12:20:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:20:53] <Hunterkll> mikespears with the paranoid stupid level cloudflare setup
[12:20:54] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:21:01] <Cl0udNinja> their method for creating images is dumb af
[12:21:06] <Hunterkll> ha
[12:21:10] <Hunterkll> it fuckin' captcha's me too
[12:21:12] <Cl0udNinja> 'make a vm and then upload it', but the process has a billion gotchas
[12:21:17] <JollyRgrs> well, tbh, if that's what you get... wouldn't it be less issues as you are more aware of what goes on in the backend?
[12:21:20] <Hunterkll> way to make sure i never visit your site
[12:21:26] <Cl0udNinja> so we're gonna dupe the process we're using for our AWS images
[12:21:33] <Activ8> mike needs to turn his paranoid indicator down a little in cloudflare lol
[12:21:34] <MikeSpears> Some fuckhead keeps trying to hit my site with L7
[12:21:40] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: yeah, sounds like GCP is not the way to go
[12:21:45] <MikeSpears> Thats why attack mode is on
[12:21:53] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: oh sry, my bad, do you want me to turn it off?
[12:22:03] <MikeSpears> It's not you
[12:22:06] <MikeSpears> Lol
[12:22:12] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, we're a software / storage provider, the ultimate goal is to provide our software on all platforms, VM, Metal, and Cloud
[12:22:17] <Activ8> oh hey I'm in, got the capture wrong 10 times though
[12:22:21] <MikeSpears> Lmao
[12:22:29] <MikeSpears> Sorry about that Activ8
[12:22:44] <JollyRgrs> "which one is a truck?" ... all pics of el caminos
[12:22:46] <Activ8> it's fine I was curious so was prepared to sit n click 
[12:23:02] <Cl0udNinja> Azure is gonna be almost the same as AWS, should be pretty straight forward, but GCP I'm gonna have to write a bunch of shit to deal with automating the process because they dont have a packer module thats close to what we do for AWS, but ofc Azure has one
[12:23:02] <Activ8> well I couldn't get past because it was telling me there was more trucks when there wasn't
[12:23:04] <MikeSpears> I'll be moving the site to an nginx box along with redeveloping it here soon. 
[12:23:11] <JollyRgrs> g'nite kids, i'm hitting the sack
[12:23:23] <Cl0udNinja> JollyRgrs, "they're literally the same image"
[12:23:25] <Hunterkll> yea i'd move it off your own stuff entirely
[12:23:33] <MikeSpears> Once I have it on nginx, can do some neat stuff to kill L7 attacks without needing CF as much
[12:23:35] <Hunterkll> there's a reason even major super-high end hosts dont host it on their own infra per-say
[12:23:41] <MikeSpears> It's not on my infra
[12:23:47] <MikeSpears> It's offsite
[12:23:57] <Hunterkll> tf then shared host's problem shouldn't be an issue
[12:23:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:23:58] <Cl0udNinja> MikeSpears is a NIMI
[12:24:01] <Cl0udNinja> NOT IN MY INFRA

[12:24:40] <MikeSpears> Why?
[12:24:55] <Hunterkll> host that shit on someone else's infra they manage for less cost

[12:26:28] <Cl0udNinja> I should probably patch them at some point

[12:29:03] <Hunterkll> any chance I can 
[12:29:17] <MikeSpears> Hunterkll: there are no decent shared providers...
[12:29:22] <Cl0udNinja> we do so much weird shit at work
[12:29:28] <dragonfleas> yeah these serverless offerings aren't great for just cute lil websites
[12:29:31] <MikeSpears> Not at least if you care about who your neighbors are
[12:29:33] <Hunterkll> Azure and AWS are pretty decent......
[12:29:40] <dragonfleas> vercel wanna charge me 20 a month for serverless functions
[12:29:43] <MikeSpears> That's differe
[12:29:50] <MikeSpears> Different 
[12:29:52] <dragonfleas> maybe i should try out lambda and amplify
[12:29:59] <Cl0udNinja> we've got docker containers that run from our software, docker containers that run as our software, provide images for AWS, GCP, Azure
[12:30:04] <Hunterkll> MikeSpears: not really, it's standard static shared webhosting 
[12:30:05] <Cl0udNinja> I cant get away from running an OS
[12:30:07] <Hunterkll> at least what i'm using
[12:30:11] <MikeSpears> When you're talking about shared hosting that's not aws/azure 
[12:30:14] <Hunterkll> well, i say static, but i've got shit like docuwiki etc
[12:30:20] <Hunterkll> i'm not using compute stuff
[12:30:26] <Hunterkll> i'm using the same shit i use at namecheap
[12:30:33] <Hunterkll> though namecheap is less complicated to manage
[12:30:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:30:34] <Cl0udNinja> MikeSpears, right, imo shared hosting is like a VPS similar to linode or the like
[12:30:39] <Hunterkll> and azure's more expensive
[12:30:41] <Activ8> that's a great price MikeSpears anyway well worth it good stuff
[12:30:51] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: shared hosting is 1 box hosting 384093284 websites
[12:30:54] <Cl0udNinja> right
[12:30:55] <Hunterkll> not VPS shit
[12:31:00] <Cl0udNinja> oh right
[12:31:03] <Hunterkll> VPS is running your own shit
[12:31:03] <Cl0udNinja> I get what you mean
[12:31:05] <MikeSpears> Yep
[12:31:12] <Activ8> who does all the support tickets? you or a team of agents?
[12:31:16] <MikeSpears> Me
[12:31:19] <Cl0udNinja> "heres your web ftp, dont fuck it up"
[12:31:22] <MikeSpears> I don't get that many
[12:31:33] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: basically - https://aws.amazon.com/websites/
[12:31:34] <Hunterkll> like that
[12:31:43] <Activ8> you probably don't I get a error 500 on your support page
[12:31:45] <Cl0udNinja> fuckin amazon literally got everything these days
[12:31:56] <Hunterkll> or this - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-web-hosting-plans-for-azure-web-sites/
[12:32:06] <Activ8> https://clients.spearwarenetworks.com/client/plugin/support_manager/client_tickets/add/1/
[12:32:08] <Activ8> error 500
[12:32:08] <Cl0udNinja> did you know you can buy satellite time via AWS?
[12:32:22] <MikeSpears> Yep that's a known issue
[12:32:27] <Hunterkll> or this - https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared/
[12:32:33] <Hunterkll> i actually really like my namecheap package
[12:32:35] <MikeSpears> Like I said, things are being moved/changed 
[12:32:39] <Activ8> ahhhh all good then mike just testing the site out
[12:32:55] <Hunterkll> I run like ~15 sites off it, some with moderately high traffic/transfer rates
[12:33:01] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, have you used packer and Azure?
[12:33:08] <Hunterkll> nope
[12:33:15] <Cl0udNinja> bleh you old turd
[12:33:16] <Hunterkll> i've helped someone unfuck their machine from packer's shenanigans though 
[12:33:26] <Hunterkll> so i'm at least really familiar with it 
[12:33:26] <Activ8> very nice, what is the client frontend do you use? cpanel or plesk or some custom stuff?
[12:33:26] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:33:29] <Cl0udNinja> eh we've got our process sorted out pretty well
[12:33:48] <Cl0udNinja> I was just gonna ask if you knew difficulty of makin an image via packer on azure
[12:33:51] *** Joins: diego-treitos (~obranco@gateway/tor-sasl/obranco)
[12:33:53] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: packer created a fuckin network bridge and all sorts of other weird shit because they didn't have a hyper-v vswitch set marked external already configured
[12:33:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:34:00] *** Quits: obranco (~obranco@gateway/tor-sasl/obranco) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:34:24] <Cl0udNinja> euh, pretty sure we wont run into shit like that lol
[12:34:39] <Cl0udNinja> we have an AWS EBS Surrogate that does a chroot install of our shit, and Azure has a similar chroot install packer plugin
[12:34:54] <Hunterkll> ye
[12:34:58] <Hunterkll> he was using this - https://github.com/camjjack/hyper-v-packer-templates
[12:35:01] <Cl0udNinja> thats gonna be my task next month I think
[12:35:17] <Cl0udNinja> this coming sprint I'm automating the gcp image process
[12:35:24] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> I made pancakes using cake mix, this must be how pioneers feel
[12:35:45] <Cl0udNinja> they must've come out like bricks
[12:35:53] <Cl0udNinja> or really really big fluff stacks
[12:36:12] <Hunterkll> but yea namecheap's hosting has been great for me
[12:36:27] <Hunterkll> one of my sites does about 1TB in transfers a month and they handle it just fine
[12:36:28] <Cl0udNinja> I use linode and softkvm
[12:36:41] <Hunterkll> another hosts a huge documentation repo that has a bunch of active users/editors 
[12:36:42] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> I experimented with batter thickness, too thick and yea they're giant puffy stacks, thin enough though and they're like pancakes but so soft and tender that you can barely flip them
[12:37:01] <Cl0udNinja> linode for my web, mail and bnc boxes, and softkvm for my media server because I got a nice deal on big storage
[12:37:17] <Hunterkll> yea this is all for websites
[12:37:27] <Cl0udNinja> pyathalon gotta practice the pan flip
[12:37:28] <Hunterkll> that are external/public 
[12:37:30] <Cl0udNinja> or use 2 pans

[13:05:14] <Cl0udNinja> yup
[13:13:47] <dragonfleas> so what are the best vps providers
[13:14:12] <dragonfleas> i just tried out like 3 different serverless solutions and they all suck unless you are on next.js lol
[13:14:19] <Cl0udNinja> depends what you're after
[13:14:54] <Cl0udNinja> if you need lots of storage, stuff like linode and whatnot are gonna be expensive, but if you just need somewhere to host a site pretty much any will do
[13:15:25] <Cl0udNinja> linode at least, is on AWS, so mostly stable
[13:15:41] <Cl0udNinja> idk where softkvm is hosted, but I got a good deal on 500GB storage
[13:17:19] <Cl0udNinja> :D camping trip scheduled
[13:25:08] <Activ8> so what are the best vps providers - that question is very much open ended.  How long is a piece of string?
[13:25:24] <Cl0udNinja> ^
[13:26:00] <Activ8> the question should be, I need a VPS for "this reason", which VPS should I go for?
[13:28:06] <catbeard> the question is what do you need the vps for
[13:28:22] <catbeard> what app
[13:29:07] <Hunterkll> eh
[13:29:12] <Hunterkll> linode's rock solid traditionally
[13:29:17] <Hunterkll> OVH is pretty good 
[13:29:29] <catbeard> and do you need it self-managed or managed
[13:29:31] <Hunterkll> Azure and AWS you can get a year free
[13:29:39] <Hunterkll> Oracle you can get two VMs for free with 1GB ram and 50GB disk each
[13:29:39] <dragonfleas> oh man
[13:29:45] <Hunterkll> for life
[13:29:47] <dragonfleas> this linode 20 dollar instance is fucking amazing
[13:29:52] <dragonfleas> it's WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the DO one
[13:29:58] <Hunterkll> no shit
[13:30:00] <Hunterkll> DO is trash tier 
[13:30:06] <Hunterkll> they're like OVH from 15 years ago
[13:30:06] <Hunterkll> :D
[13:30:28] <dragonfleas> i've already expended my free tier of azure, gcp, and aws lmao
[13:30:38] <Hunterkll> Oracle
[13:30:44] <Hunterkll> 1GB ram, 50GB disk, *Two* instances

[13:30:54] <dragonfleas> oh wait
[13:31:03] <dragonfleas> free for life you say? :eyes-emoji:
[13:31:04] <Activ8> free for life until they tell you otherwise lol
[13:31:12] <Hunterkll> yes
[13:31:16] <Hunterkll> and that's *two* instances
[13:31:21] <Activ8> be careful you don't go over your free tier otherwise you will get an auto charge lol
[13:31:32] <Activ8> be VERY careful
[13:31:35] <Hunterkll> Activ8: you have to actually convert to a paid account to do that shit
[13:31:53] <Activ8> for oracle? really?
[13:31:57] <Hunterkll> Activ8: it took me over a month andmultiple support tickets to get my account switched to paid
[13:31:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:32:06] <Hunterkll> cuz i was broken in their back end
[13:32:13] <Activ8> fuck in that case I'm jumping on that free shit right now
[13:32:34] <Hunterkll> you DO need a card to validate/set up the account(and a real phone number) 
[13:32:42] <Hunterkll> but you have to manually trigger the switch to PAYG 
[13:32:50] <Activ8> yeh sure got plenty of them, with zero funds in
[13:32:56] <Activ8> I have virtual cards now
[13:32:57] <Activ8> tehe
[13:33:20] <Hunterkll> also if you're in the weird broke half-state I was you can fuck up and end up getting some charges

[13:35:48] <Hunterkll> I cut mine into two 50GB disks per VM

[13:36:22] <Activ8> 2 amd vms with 100gb disks each
[13:36:51] <Activ8> I'm trying to find where I put my ssh key so I can import it into the cloud
[13:36:59] <Hunterkll> you do that when spinning up the VMs
[13:37:19] <Activ8> I use the same key so import it 
[13:37:26] <Hunterkll> yea you can do that
[13:37:46] <Activ8> good
[13:37:56] <Activ8> great start

[13:40:22] <dragonfleas> i think github actions is free up to a certain point though so I can just use that
[13:40:28] <dragonfleas> just set up a runner to do all my code deploys for me

[13:41:47] <dragonfleas> *thinking cap*
[13:42:15] <dragonfleas> they literally market themselves as an alternative to aws, they could at least have some sort of firebase/amplify like offering
[13:42:31] <dragonfleas> i'm gonna stop complaining and enjoy this 20 dollar great instance
[13:42:38] <Hunterkll> you mean like

[13:43:07] <dragonfleas> those aren't ez mode ci/cd
[13:43:28] <dragonfleas> all of those require a metric fuck ton of boilerplating
[13:43:51] <Hunterkll> oh okay you want docker, elastick, dokku, lxd, etc?
[13:43:54] <Hunterkll> linode has all that too
[13:43:56] <dragonfleas> look at things like netlify, vercel, etc
[13:44:07] <dragonfleas> that's what i'm talking about
[13:44:15] <Activ8> I moved my dns over to quad9
[13:44:20] <Activ8> was on cloudflare
[13:45:15] <Hunterkll> i mean
[13:45:20] <Hunterkll> they aslo got their regular api 
[13:45:26] <Hunterkll> they got everything you need
[13:45:28] <Hunterkll> if you're competent 
[13:45:37] <dragonfleas> lol
[13:46:21] <Hunterkll> https://stackshare.io/stackups/firebase-vs-linode
[13:46:25] <Hunterkll> "Realtime backend made easy", "Fast and responsive" and "Easy setup" are the key factors why developers consider Firebase; whereas "Extremely reliable", "Good value" and "Easy to configure" are the primary reasons why Linode is favored.
[13:46:42] <dragonfleas> firebase is extremely fucking reliable
[13:47:19] <dragonfleas> also easy setup and easy to configure are nearly synonymous
[13:47:41] <Hunterkll> anyway, linode is what you do if you ahve a competent infra team and want to keep costs down
[13:47:47] <Hunterkll> firebase is if you don't care how much you spend and want ez mode
[13:47:56] <dragonfleas> yeah that's right
[13:48:13] <Hunterkll> linode is if you want unlimited multi-cloud damn good scalability 
[13:48:19] <Hunterkll> firebase is if you dont care what your latency really is
[13:49:00] <dragonfleas> firebase is very very scalable
[13:49:06] <Hunterkll> for a price
[13:49:24] <dragonfleas> that's why I used supabase
[13:49:24] <Hunterkll> i can do it with AWS/Azure/Linode/GCP/Oracle compute instances for a fraction of the cost
[13:49:33] <dragonfleas> all the firebase ease of use, but all based on opensource projects
[13:49:54] <dragonfleas> https://supabase.io/
[13:50:41] *** Joins: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm)
[13:50:45] <dragonfleas> do CI/CD on AWS for a fraction of the cost of something like firebase/amplify/vercel? yeah i don't think so
[13:51:01] <Hunterkll> I said *compute instances*
[13:51:13] <Hunterkll> IE: I'm installing and running all that fancy shit your developer little bitch whiny ass wants 
[13:51:19] <Hunterkll> you just use your tools like you would on those other services
[13:51:24] <dragonfleas> :O
[13:52:17] <Hunterkll> In fact I can literally set up instances on every provider and to you it looks like one big "serverless" orgy system that you dont realize is 32095872309583 providers

[21:28:55] <Hunterkll> yea
[21:29:06] <Hunterkll> corn266: they are a pretty big bank that fuckin underpins a lot of shit 
[21:29:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:29:16] <corn266> well
[21:29:23] <corn266> i guess that's the next step
[21:29:33] <Hunterkll> i can send you a referral so we get bonuses
[21:29:35] <corn266> i got $35k in my manual and idk how to protect it
[21:29:35] <Hunterkll> they have promotions all the time

[21:31:25] <Hunterkll> lame
[21:31:34] <Hunterkll> but its $310 free if you actually get a loan for both of us
[21:31:34] <Hunterkll> LOL
[21:31:35] <corn266> bruuuuuuuuuuuh
[21:31:56] <corn266> how much you think the loans are
[21:32:10] <corn266> cause i can down a $1k loan like your mom downs dick
[21:32:11] <Hunterkll> $5k to $100k loan amounts, minimum interest rate 4.99%
[21:32:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:32:19] <corn266> eh
[21:32:29] <corn266> i'd shuffle a money or 2 but it can be done

[21:59:46] <Cl0udNinja> do you have any decent reading / guides on sockets and interrupts in code? tryin to wrap my brain around this
[22:00:51] <Hunterkll> erm?
[22:00:56] <Hunterkll> what do you mean by sockets.....
[22:01:01] <Hunterkll> datashet shows yout he pinouts.....

[22:04:11] <Cl0udNinja> so, the system has a cpu/mcu chip, and an ethernet chip... you do up a bunch of code to make a web server, and register an interrupt for the eth chip to the cpu. once the code is running... if a listen command is called, does the listen infinitely wait, or does it just tell the eth chip 'hey we are listening' and then continue on with the code beyond the listen()?
[22:04:38] <Hunterkll> what model #s
[22:04:42] <Hunterkll> because each one can do things differently
[22:04:57] <Hunterkll> if its just a raw ethernet phy without any server capability you're in for a bad time
[22:05:33] <Hunterkll> i usually use shit like how the arduino ethernet shield works
[22:06:13] <Hunterkll> the wiznet w5500 for example
[22:06:16] <Cl0udNinja> the eth chip is a wiznet 5500 (which is common on arduino shields), and mcu atmega32u4. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this code, and in general, how network sockets / interrupts work together in regard to the rest of the code
[22:06:19] <Hunterkll> yep
[22:07:00] <Hunterkll> the gist of it is
[22:07:06] <Hunterkll> you set up shit on the ethernet side and say
[22:07:12] <Hunterkll> "hey let me know when you got something for me to process"
[22:07:21] <Cl0udNinja> right, thats registering the interrupt
[22:07:25] <Hunterkll> then you read it in from the ethernet side after jumping into your processing code
[22:07:30] <Hunterkll> then go back to your normal shit
[22:08:15] <Hunterkll> here
[22:08:20] <Hunterkll> maybe a nice example

[22:09:01] <Activ8> `bofh
[22:09:01] <layer8> Activ8, BOFH says: Someone hooked the twisted pair wires into the answering machine.
[22:09:10] <Cl0udNinja> ok, so yeah I was right then, the listen just says 'hey, listen for things and then call this thing when you've got a thing', the hardware triggers the interrupt pin, and that causes the code to jump to interrupt code block, once thats done, the code returns to where it was before the jump
[22:09:12] <Cl0udNinja> right?
[22:09:30] <Hunterkll> thats a rough gist of it yea

[22:10:00] <Hunterkll> non-http telnet server
[22:10:14] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I've got a wiznet library with the code most of those are based on
[22:10:19] <Cl0udNinja> the ioLibrary one
[22:10:29] <Cl0udNinja> which should really be lolLibrary
[22:10:31] <Hunterkll> these implementations should show you what you need to get 
[22:10:36] <Hunterkll> the first one has a ton of http examples
[22:10:39] <Hunterkll> second one is a lot simpler
[22:11:09] <Hunterkll> so simple
[22:11:11] <Hunterkll> it doesnt have any code
