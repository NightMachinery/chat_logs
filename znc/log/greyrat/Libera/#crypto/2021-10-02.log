[00:01:12] <yawkat> i once reverted an edit to a wiki article where someone was very upset that OTP isnt IND-CPA secure
[00:01:20] <riv> hehe
[00:01:22] <snappy> lollipops
[00:01:37] <yawkat> let me find it
[00:01:57] <Hash> Hey I'm building the site for #security
[00:02:09] <Hash> Will be at hashsecurity.net later when 
[00:02:12] <yawkat> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chosen-plaintext_attack&diff=prev&oldid=966497815
[00:02:18] <yawkat> "The one-time pad is the only known provably secure encryption scheme publicly disclosed."
[00:02:19] <Hash> right now https://websec.anti.guru/
[00:02:22] <riv> > hashsecurity
[00:02:25] <riv> nice pun
[00:02:42] <Hash> I bought hashsecurity.org
[00:02:58] <Hash> I will have my own site, blogs, learning resources, etc. etc. projects, code for stuff
[00:03:04] <yawkat> "The attack as postulated is not an attack that anyone would consider meaningful: I can get the key if I choose the cipher-text but only the key for that cipher-text, which I knew anyway. One-time pads can only definitionally be implemented with random keys of a length equal to the plaintext. IMO, the whole subsection should be removed but I thought it too bold for a humble unregistered user."
[00:03:04] <Hash> :)
[00:03:17] <Hash> hashsecurity.net is for #security channel
[00:03:41] <Hash> I say that if you want to have a channel site 
[00:03:42] <riv> that's another good one
[00:03:43] <Hash> I can do it.
[00:03:50] <riv> if you know the message, you can recover the key
[00:04:53] <Hash> I figured hash is my name, and I did webdev for like 12 years, networking/hardware/sysadmin before that for 10 years etc. I ahve 20+ years exp, so let's do a bachelor of comp sci in cybersecurity 
[00:04:59] <Hash> I didn't want to make software anymore
[00:05:26] <Hash> So, I figured I can offer some services asap, like clean up restore and protect your cms joomla/wp etc. 
[00:05:44] <Hash> Pentesting report and other vuln. scanning fully thorough
[00:05:53] <Hash> and one more service, social engineering pen test
[00:06:03] <Hash> Others I will learn as I go
[00:06:15] <Hash> But one day, 5 years, 10 years vision, have my own company of security

[03:18:22] <damarusama> there seems to be a lot of 'password cracking tools' around, but how would you go with a random string like that? Is there a tool to 'test' different encryption until it finds one that have the words I know are in there?
[03:18:53] <damarusama> I was suprised to see that there was only numbers in the code with 1675 characters
[03:21:12] <sarnold> damarusama: sometimes tools like this can be helpful https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
[03:22:09] <damarusama> nice thanks
[03:28:53] <damarusama> this is a cool tool - I like the entropy tool to kind of get me in a certain direction, as I though it doesn't seems to be relly encrypted, 
[03:29:06] <damarusama> as the shannon entropy is like around 3

[03:39:44] <sarnold> damarusama: it probably would, yeah, though it might require knowing more about the known text than you currently do. still, it sounds promising :)
[03:40:47] <damarusama> yeah well it doesn't seems to be deeply encrypted - it's only numbers and not too random, the entropy is really low and I know some of the content... so it feels pretty close

[03:57:16] <Alipha> damarusama: no, it's a signing algorithm
[04:06:50] <damarusama> so, if the entropy is of 3.2, does that confirm that the text/code is not encrypted? but it's only transformed ? 
[04:12:38] <sarnold> the references i found for ES256 were all for use in "JWT", a signature kind of thing (as Alipha corrected me) -- those will have structure of their own, and maybe you're just measuring that structure

[23:38:18] <damarusama> if a program can decrypt a string - and if the program is working in isolation (not connecting to any remote server) that program source has the code to encrypt with the same algorith ?
[23:40:13] <ericonr> not necessarily
[23:40:42] <Wulf> damarusama: I think this is true most of the time
[23:40:49] <ericonr> also that lol
[23:41:00] <Wulf> maybe not the code, but the code could be added.
[23:41:09] <Wulf> the key material should be present at least.
[23:41:45] <damarusama> and I assume the encryption type as well
[23:42:08] <Wulf> damarusama: what's the context of your question?

[23:44:12] <damarusama> purely theorical :D
[23:45:04] <Wulf> yeah, sure
[23:45:19] <tolarz> There are programs that can encrypt in isolation, but not decrypt.
[23:45:26] <tolarz> I don't see why the reverse shouldn't be possible.
[23:46:45] <Wulf> tolarz: of course it can be possible, if the encryption functions are simply not implemented. But in general I think the encryption key can be derived from the decryption key. But not the other way round.
[23:50:10] <tolarz> Why is encryption inherently different from decryption?
[23:51:26] <Wulf> tolarz: With symmetric encryption, it's not :)
[23:51:33] <tolarz> yeah
[23:51:54] <tolarz> why does asymmetric encryption only exists the way it exists (encryption done publicly, decryption privately)?
[23:52:24] <ericonr> it kinda doesn't?
[23:52:42] <ericonr> signing schemes with RSA encrypt with the private key

[23:53:02] <Wulf> that's signing, not encrypting.
