[03:12:20] <jkk> Classic McEliece looks nice
[03:12:37] <sarnold> is that the one with 256kb signatures?
[03:12:42] <sarnold> or something silly.. heh
[03:13:20] <jkk> there is plenty of space on hd :)
[03:13:26] <jkk> its oldest and most tested
[03:13:46] <sarnold> sure, depending upon what you want it for, it could work :)

[03:27:21] <sarnold> jkk: I'm sure there's libraries of things, but I don't think any of the PQ choices are understood well enough to standardize on any specific one, yet
[03:28:39] <sarnold> jkk: the only postquantum thing I've seen in the wild is from openssh, https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
[03:28:44] <sarnold> jkk: it sounds pretty experimental
[03:28:52] <jkk> kem is used to encrypt symmetric key right?
[03:29:09] <jkk> well I am keen to use this algo for my emails
[03:29:34] <jkk> no matter how experimental it offers some degree of post quantum anonimity :)

[05:22:25] <MacGyver> And iirc already defaults to AES-XTS with two 256-bit keys because of the whole terabyte thing.

[13:51:52] <yawkat> but bouncycastle probably has it around somewhere
[13:52:05] <yawkat> you should get the ECParameterSpec from the library, not build it yourself
[13:52:51] <Deknos> you know what would be interesting?  if there would be a system with two different private keys which match to each other but are different and not computable from each other. that would mean automatic authentication as well. i wonder if this is feasible or makes sense.
[13:55:22] <yawkat> "match to each other"?
[13:55:25] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[13:56:20] <Deknos> like a public key and a private key match to each other. but you can compute the public key from the private key
[13:57:23] <palindrome> I guess I need to find something like this in python's hazmat https://pastebin.com/1U1ibpaH
[13:59:22] <yawkat> Deknos: i think that is mathematically impossible for common schemes, but you can easily create a scheme with this property
[14:00:40] <yawkat> by essentially replacing the original private key with a hash function output of some long string that is the new private key, then finding a second private key is equivalent to finding a hash function collision

[22:13:57] <TimMc> hmm!
[22:14:29] <TimMc> I mean, the RAND table isn't a *totally* awful way of doing this, but... why not pi or sqrt(2)?
[22:14:40] <TimMc> Maybe this is an older decision?
[22:16:11] <maroon> it doesn't defend against the time-traveler from the future going back to 1955
[22:16:37] <MacGyver> Because you can find any number in pi or sqrt(2).
[22:16:54] <TimMc> Well sure, that's why you choose something from the beginning.
[22:17:11] <TimMc> or an index based on something equally "rigid"
[22:17:31] <maroon> there's bias in the first 2 digits of sqrt(2)
[22:17:47] <MacGyver> I'd put more confidence in saying "these completely unrelated tables published before public key crypto existed" than in "this arbitrary constant out of all arbitrary constants I could've chosen."
[22:18:39] <TimMc> (Also, the normality of pi and sqrt(2) is unknown...)
[22:19:43] <TimMc> "Index into pi using my birthdate in YYYYMMDD" is pretty arbitrary too, and has way less opportunity for choice.
[22:19:44] <maroon> better than using the beginning is to always have a spot deeper into the fraction that's always used
[22:21:43] <TimMc> yeah, fair enough
