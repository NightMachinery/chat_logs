[03:03:26] <rickyrick> ya i don't think so
[03:03:43] <rickyrick> Short of a fancy regex expression for splititng each string by a-z and 0-9 boundaries
[03:03:54] <rickyrick> Then sorting by column
[03:04:09] <Bayes> yeah that's what I do
[03:04:17] <rickyrick> lmao
[03:04:25] <rickyrick> How bad is the splitting
[03:04:31] <Bayes> not too bad
[03:04:40] <rickyrick> regex or otherwise?
[03:04:47] <Bayes> but I find regex fun so ymmv
[03:05:37] <Bayes> in any case, lately I defaulted to using name lists as dictionaries
[03:05:50] * rickyrick brings out the holy water
[03:05:59] <rickyrick> Yeah I think that's the point
[03:06:03] <Bayes> so I do label_something(x) and I go from x to a decent label
[03:06:30] <rickyrick> Why have lists and dicts when you can just have lists

[04:00:21] <redrum88> Hi, I'm new to R and start to playing with Bayesian networks on it. Is it possible to visualize a network from bnlearn like this?: https://imgur.com/a/WKEZHfL
[04:01:16] <rickyrick> Does using plot() not work
[04:03:21] <redrum88> hm, good point. I've been using graphviz.plot(dag) but it just show the nodes.
[04:03:37] <redrum88> I'm going to try, after some packages installation finishes
[04:03:45] <rickyrick> lol?
[04:03:54] <rickyrick> Never used bnlearn to be fair
[04:03:55] <rickyrick> :^)
[04:04:18] <redrum88> haha
[04:05:01] <rickyrick> Package docs say there's a plot method for bn objects
[04:05:07] <rickyrick> idk if it's the result you want
[04:15:36] <redrum88> no, it didnt work

[20:43:58] <Bayes> OnlineCop yeah I figured
[20:44:05] <Bayes> so either chain many R commands using ;
[20:44:25] <Bayes> or see if your distro package manager provide the packages, which might make it easier for you to manage
[20:44:42] <Bayes> both should work fine
[20:45:18] <OnlineCop> I should be able to install the styler, but is anyone familiar with where this configuration file needs to reside? I'd like to, for example, ignore line length. Would I just copy in some configuration file somewhere?

[23:17:06] <Bayes> is FactoMineR still the de factor choice for multivariate analysis?

[23:30:28] <resistor4u> in ggrepel, i cannot recall the arg option to force `geom_text` and `geom_label` to draw lines indicating the points
[23:30:35] <resistor4u> anyone got that off top of head
[23:32:36] <rickyrick> Wasn't it setting min segment length to 0
[23:33:19] <resistor4u> it might be force=100 but this seems to "force" the text oout of the way unmessarily
[23:35:02] <resistor4u> rickyrick: that def works
[23:35:06] <rickyrick> hot
[23:35:20] <resistor4u> thanks
[23:36:31] <Bayes> TIL ggrepel provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels:
[23:36:41] <rickyrick> LOL
[23:36:44] <Bayes> that name made me think of regexes
[23:36:52] <fendur> me too
[23:36:56] <rickyrick> Welcome to 2014
[23:36:59] <rickyrick> Or whever ggrepel was released
[23:37:10] <rickyrick> 2016 it seems :^)
[23:37:20] <Bayes> also ggpairs takes 50 seconds to produce a pairs plot :(
[23:38:12] <rickyrick> Data is probably too big :^)
[23:38:30] <Bayes> 14:08:01 > dim(X)
[23:38:30] <Bayes> [1] 240  18
[23:38:33] <Bayes> sure
[23:38:44] <rickyrick> wat
[23:38:47] <rickyrick> Oh
[23:38:49] <rickyrick> 18 columns
[23:38:51] <rickyrick> Yeah that'll do you in
[23:39:12] <Bayes> base R takes < 10 but it's a pita to tweak as well
[23:39:14] <rickyrick> 240 * 18 * 17 points
[23:39:19] <Bayes> well, what can one do
[23:39:31] <rickyrick> Oops lost an /2
[23:39:37] <rickyrick> Yeah base R plotting is fast
[23:39:40] <Bayes> what u on ma
[23:39:41] <rickyrick> Especially if you use pch = "."
[23:39:41] <Bayes> man
[23:39:55] <rickyrick> 240x18 in a pairs plot yields 36720 total points to draw
[23:39:57] <Bayes> oh I didn't know that hax
[23:40:15] <rickyrick> Yeah that's only really if you have so many points it doesn't make sense to draw a full symbol for each
[23:40:18] <rickyrick> It just draws a pixel
[23:40:25] <Bayes> idk i never went to school
[23:40:31] <rickyrick> :^)
