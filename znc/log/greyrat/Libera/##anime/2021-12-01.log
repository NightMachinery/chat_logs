[04:32:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ?
[04:33:37] <S_T_A_N> snake is being a problem again. He refuses to use my nick because I specially asked him not to call me stan. 
[04:33:45] <amigojapan> snake: S_T_A_N wants to have underscores on his name
[04:33:54] <S_T_A_N> He does it on purpose 
[04:34:13] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, He knows. We have been though this. 
[04:34:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Why not just tab-complete S_T_A_N 's nick?
[04:35:40] <snake> amigojapan, Aurora_v_kosmose ok got it, but i dont have that feature on my irc client, and im using a 40 key keyboard, so i can't type underscores
[04:36:12] <snake> shit
[04:37:03] <snake> ok so i have tab completion but it doesnt work for stan's nick without typing one underscore
[04:37:13] <snake> it doesn't cycle thru, it just tells me a list of options
[04:38:30] <ButterNoodle> can u just rebind the enter or space bar to _
[04:38:49] <snake> yeah i could bend over backwards to write stan's nick the way he wants us to
[04:39:03] <ButterNoodle> I think he wants you to bend over
[04:39:12] <snake> or i could just type it the way i want, and the world will still keep spinning
[04:39:16] <snake> nothing bad will happen
[04:39:23] <ButterNoodle> ur dick could fall off
[04:39:26] <snake> true
[04:39:27] <ButterNoodle> or it couldnt..
[04:39:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Free dildo
[04:39:36] <snake> anyways, im a gentleman, so as i said earlier, i will try to do better
[04:41:04] <amigojapan> snake: 40 key keyboard?
[04:41:15] <ButterNoodle> like a plank
[04:41:18] <ButterNoodle> or an ergo
[04:41:28] <snake> amigojapan, yup, alpha, numbers, space, comma, period, and uh tab
[04:41:31] <ButterNoodle> well not an ergo..
[04:42:02] <MootPoot> perv
[04:42:03] <snake> its a mechanical keyboard
[04:42:08] <amigojapan> I see, weird, is it on a phone? snake 
[04:42:13] <amigojapan> Oh

[04:42:29] <MootPoot> gatorade browns

[04:42:30] <ButterNoodle> browns are for pooping
[04:42:37] <MootPoot> oh shit
[04:42:44] <MootPoot> snake: you like browns too
[04:42:45] <MootPoot> my man
[04:42:51] <S_T_A_N> The solution is you don't talk to me. You already know that but keep doing it so obviously you are trying to be a dick on purpose
[04:42:53] <snake> MootPoot, yeah i want to try them
[04:42:58] <amigojapan> snake: hard to program on that
[04:43:01] <MootPoot> I only use browns
[04:43:23] <MootPoot>  they're just quieter blues - a little less of a clean break but that is it
[04:43:26] <ButterNoodle> I take all the ladies to brown town
[04:43:38] <ButterNoodle> *only blues
[04:43:49] <snake> the solution is stan changes his nick to something reasonable, or stops caring if people write "stan". you already know that but keep having a meltdown everytime i talk to you, so you are obviously trying to be a dick on purpose
[04:43:57] * ButterNoodle looks around for someone w reds to bash

[04:55:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah
[04:55:23] <mixfix41> well if you dont use the plugins of weechat then
[04:55:23] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I want a girl to put her cream into my coffee
[04:55:31] <S_T_A_N> There is a simple solution(don't talk to me), they have been given this solution and they ignore it because they get a kick out of being an ass. 
[04:55:44] <Terminus> Aurora_v_kosmose: i just don't want to think about configuring another client. irssi works well enough.
[04:56:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Terminus: Fair enough.
[04:56:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> :/ It's C with glib
[04:56:42] <mixfix41> esp desktop notifications thats the only one ive done and its really cool
[04:56:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @ hexchat
[04:56:58] <snake> stan: you are ignoring the solution i proposed too (to your invented imaginary problem)
[04:57:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> GLIB is OO for masochists...
[04:57:29] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, see they do it again.
[04:58:12] <S_T_A_N> snake, if you aren't going to respect who I am, don't talk to me.
[04:58:15] <Terminus> specifically, i don't want to think about getting proper znc timestamp playback to work in weechat.
[04:58:23] <snake> stan: got it
[04:58:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Terminus: ah
[04:58:39] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, and again.
[04:58:53] <mixfix41> if you dont need desktop notification in irssi you can enable screen flash if you are ping on irc
[04:59:09] <S_T_A_N> He's clearly doing it on purpose to be a dick
[04:59:38] <snake> i was just responding to your message, something any respectful person would do, rather than just give you the cold shoulder
[05:00:01] <Terminus> also, every screenshot of weechat i've seen shows too much screen real estate being used for the channel and nick list. things i don't need at all.
[05:00:25] <S_T_A_N> snake, you just did the same thing, without referring to me by something I have asked you not to. Is that hard? 
[05:00:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Terminus: You can actually tune how much they take.
[05:00:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But those screenshots are mostly taken on 1024x768 or 1280x1024 monitors.
[05:01:00] <Terminus> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah, i figured. i just don't want to bother. the colors are nice though. maybe i'll give it a shot one day.
[05:01:05] <snake> stan: is it hard to come up with something mundane and pointless as an excuse to be enraged about?
[05:01:14] <S_T_A_N> Aurora_v_kosmose, and again
[05:01:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Anything not 4:3 looks quite a lot better.
[05:01:42] <Terminus> my terminals are 132x43 so whatever i use has to use the space well.
[05:01:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you're still using 4:3, I recommend checking power rating of the monitors, yearly cost and seeing if it isn't worth your while to replace them.

[06:02:36] <MootPoot> its funny to me how we as a society lose our shits over pedos but then proceed to not give two fucks about orphans
[06:02:37] <snake> it was oddly direct, and oddly members of the public
[06:02:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: indeed
[06:02:59] <MootPoot> I feel like its more about hating pedos then taking care of kids
[06:03:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And even that feels like it's more about virtue signaling than anything else

[06:30:17] <snake> amigojapan, well which is it lol
[06:30:22] <snake> it varies
[06:30:31] <snake> so if you estimate it you just use the avg probably
[06:31:28] <amigojapan> Snake, I think it is cause in Japan they always count a medical month by 28 days
[06:31:38] <snake> oh a medical month

[07:04:10] <emmeka> I remember once in one channel someone *insisted* on calling me "emmy" and it drove me absolutely insane for no rational reason, but they kept doing it just to troll me, which worked, and made me even more pissed off
[07:04:33] <snake> emmy is not even easier to write than emmeka
[07:04:36] <snake> it is roughly the same
[07:06:12] <snake> emmeka, if anyone can come in here and get enraged over something then you are easily manipulated. that is not trolling, that is just lacking critical thinking abilities
[07:06:29] <snake> like come on, it makes no difference if i write stan or hilight the guy by typing underscores
[07:06:42] <emmeka> well trolling is the more generous explanation, either that or you're just being obtuse for the sake of being obtuse
[07:06:56] <snake> im just chatting
[07:07:02] <emmeka> snake you're right, it makes no difference, it's actually the same number of keystrokes, so why are you doing it
[07:07:20] <emmeka> you're determined to pick a fight that is meaningless
[07:07:46] <snake> you are merely saying all my points against me
[07:07:55] <snake> which is fine, but it doesnt make you right

[07:11:19] <MootPoot> snake: well its better then the blockage I was having earlier
[07:11:25] <snake> emmeka, im just going to keep minding my business and do nothing to modify my behavior, since i like to easily write short nicks out instead of obsessively hitting tab constantly

[07:13:26] <emmeka> well, that's annoying, and will probably result in me having to keep dealing with this relatively stupid problem just because you've decided this is your hill to die on.

[07:16:59] <snake> !addquote <Sxem> i will have to put stan on ignore if he keeps trolling by pretending to care about forcing everyone to type s underscore tab instead of stan. i dont even capitalize, its too hard on my hands
[07:16:59] <ImoutoBot> snake: Quote added for Sxem (92)
[07:17:02] <Sxem_> underscore is the hardest to reach of all shit buttons
[07:17:09] <snake> it really is a shit key
[07:17:13] <Sxem_> underscore is the hardest to reach of all shift buttons
[07:17:19] <Sxem_> almost
[07:17:23] <snake> hyphen is easier, space is easier than that
[07:17:29] <emmeka> snake and I was prepared to ignore the earlier stupidity until I seen you do it again for no particularly good reason
[07:17:30] <Sxem_> for right handers
[07:17:36] <MootPoot> That would be self flaggelation at that point davic 
[07:18:06] <Sxem_> luckily i never talk to stan, so it hasnt been a problem. but if i keep seeing this same bullshit over and over, id have to ignore stan to make it stop
[07:18:08] <snake> emmeka, ok thanks for sharing your opinion
[07:18:28] <snake> i just wanted to comment on the issue at hand, which was whether stan should drink espresso or not
[07:18:35] <MootPoot> The underscore is the reason why Pop OS has such a dumb name 
[07:18:58] <MootPoot> But if that's the case it seems that SQL is set out to fuck us right handers 
[07:19:04] <MootPoot> With all the underscores 
[07:19:22] <snake> how to fuck with ##anime ops. step 1: choose a stupid nickname. step 2: identify users that happen to type your nick out by hand. step 3: whine like a LITTLE FUCKING BITCH EVERY SINGLE TIME THIS HAPPENS

[07:20:17] <Omega037> I am low carb, so I don't really eat cookies
[07:20:24] <snake> again, two solutions were brought up. and neither were implemented, out of lack of cooperation:
[07:20:25] <Omega037> My wife is making cauliflower latkes tomorrow
[07:20:30] <snake> 1. stop calling stan stan
[07:20:31] <MootPoot> I'm watching castlevania s3 while reading this IRC chat all while on the toilet
[07:20:38] <snake> 2. stan stops caring if people call them stan
[07:20:42] <snake> both great ideas
[07:20:53] <Sxem_> i finished s04
[07:20:59] <snake> but not worth it for either party
[07:21:00] <MootPoot> just /ignore S_T_A_N 
[07:21:03] <snake> i rest my case

[07:22:29] <emmeka> like look guys there's two separate issues here.
[07:22:36] <MootPoot> I proceeded to not care and continue talking to butter

[07:23:45] <emmeka> one is that he's being kind of ridiculous about insisting people type underscores in his nick. the other is that snake does this intentionally, and goes out of his way to repeat doing it over and over again whenever it is pointed out to him, out of pure spite or a desire to troll or whatever
[07:23:45] <S_T_A_N> emmeka, I'd ignore him but he would just keep doing it out of my sight. Like it's insane that he keeps doing it on purpose after I made it clear I care
[07:24:13] <snake> emmeka, there is one issue here from your perspective
[07:24:17] <snake> two users are fighting
[07:24:27] <snake> but who's issue is it? it doesn't have to be your issue
[07:24:30] <davic> snake and S_T_A_N I can make it easy for you two
[07:24:47] <snake> it is entirely stan's issue
[07:24:53] <snake> but we're all gonna coddle him
[07:24:56] <MootPoot> You guys are making my time on the shitter more interesting
[07:24:59] <davic> stop being cunts. Stop talking about it, get some air. Buy some stonks. Marry beaky. Go live your lives. This is fucking stupid ok?
[07:25:01] <MootPoot> Thank you
[07:25:05] <S_T_A_N> It's an issue you are creating snake  
[07:25:18] <snake> no you
[07:25:26] <S_T_A_N> You can just not call me stan. You don't have to call me S_T_A_N but don't call me stan

[07:26:40] <Sxem_> everyone must bow to your will and obey your commands?
[07:27:01] <snake> he definitely has some strange control kink, and we're just playing into it at this point
[07:27:05] <Sxem_> we are all your slaves?
[07:27:12] <Sxem_> the ego on this guy
[07:27:25] <S_T_A_N> davic, emmeka is this what you consider "Be respectful and courteous". 
[07:27:33] <snake> you are so important look, 3-4 ops are arguing that i stop typing your nick without the underline
[07:27:36] <Sxem_> maybe you shd make your own channel, where you can force ppl to call you master or whatever
[07:27:40] <emmeka> snake S_T_A_N has clarified that he doesn't care about you shortening his nick, but has a particular issue with being called stan, specifically. why? I don't fucking know. who cares. just come up with something you can both live with

[07:58:27] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[07:58:37] <MootPoot> #notmetoo
[07:58:40] <ButterNoodle> :|
[07:58:45] <MootPoot> never had a NES
[07:58:52] <MootPoot> first nintendo thing I had was a DS I think
[07:58:53] <ButterNoodle> I got one rite now
[07:59:03] <MootPoot> then wii, then wii u
[07:59:07] <MootPoot> then never again
[07:59:13] <snake> my first nintendo was the wii
[07:59:18] <snake> i loved that fucking console
[07:59:20] <MootPoot> I've been looking at the switch on occaasion  but the game library
[07:59:30] <snake> the homebrew channel changed my life
[07:59:30] <MootPoot> literally everything on there I have better elsewhere or I dont care for
[07:59:31] <emmeka> the NES was already several generations out of date when I got it, but it was my first video game console and for many years my only one
[07:59:37] <emmeka> god bless late 90s yard sales
[07:59:41] <ButterNoodle> switch is good if u want exclusive game.. thats it
[07:59:46] <emmeka> when these things could be had for like $1
[08:00:00] <ButterNoodle> now the retro gaming market has drove those prices up emmeka..
[08:00:06] <emmeka> yeah it's crazy
[08:00:09] <ButterNoodle> everyone now wants to see what its sellign for on ebay..
[08:00:13] <emmeka> I priced out some of my collection a while ago
[08:00:17] <snake> seriously i bought a switch and i have 1 game for it
[08:00:21] <snake> and idk what to do now
[08:00:29] <emmeka> I easily have thousands, by Ebay prices
[08:00:33] <snake> sell it maybe lol
[08:00:35] <emmeka> most of which I paid pennies for
[08:00:39] <ButterNoodle> I have about a dozen switch games
[08:00:51] <ButterNoodle> I dont travel anymore so I dont really play it
[08:00:53] * MootPoot checks his wallet
[08:01:00] <emmeka> snake I sold some. I had 2 sets of NES powergloves. I bought them at a flea market for $5 in like 2004. They sold for $300.
[08:01:00] <MootPoot> I have 12 dollars 
[08:01:10] <S_T_A_N> Every new switch game I get I regret because it's so underpowered. 
[08:01:22] <MootPoot> I could go get a burger but if I did I won't have any money left 
[08:01:23] <snake> emmeka, yeah i remember this story :p
[08:01:28] <snake> trader emmeka
[08:01:30] <ButterNoodle> its not made for top games
[08:01:33] <S_T_A_N> It's kinda pathetic how many exclusives for it run terribly 
[08:01:35] <ButterNoodle> its made for nintendo games
[08:01:41] <emmeka> I considered a Switch only because I'd run Android on it and then have a tablet as well
[08:01:45] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, even some of those have issues
[08:01:47] <MootPoot> Smol titty games 
[08:01:59] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N: I havent played it enough to notice..
[08:02:00] <MootPoot> emmeka: can you do that? I thought it was locked down 
[08:02:08] <emmeka> MootPoot you can with launch models.
[08:02:14] <emmeka> not with new ones, and not with the lite
[08:02:20] <MootPoot> Rip
[08:02:20] <S_T_A_N> Not yet*
[08:02:21] <ButterNoodle> its arm.. you can install arch
[08:02:24] <emmeka> so you have to track down specific serial numbers used.
[08:02:26] <MootPoot> PS3 memories 
[08:02:30] <S_T_A_N> It will get craked 
[08:02:53] <emmeka> S_T_A_N probably, but the launch models are actually trivial to do.
[08:02:56] <S_T_A_N> I kinda want to get another one so I can hack my launch model
[08:03:03] <emmeka> the hack is a softmod
[08:03:06] <MootPoot> I thought the jailbreak scene basically died with ps4/xb1
[08:03:07] <emmeka> no need to get another
[08:03:16] <amigojapan> pretender2: actually that song was already very old by the time Freddy Mercury came along
[08:03:19] <emmeka> remove the SD card with Android on it, and it goes back to being a regular Switch
[08:03:24] <S_T_A_N> emmeka, right, but it's possible something new will get found. 
[08:03:24] <MootPoot> there were still hacks but much rarer
[08:03:48] <S_T_A_N> Eventually hopefully it will reach 3DS levels of hackable 
[08:04:10] <emmeka> MootPoot nah there's a full Android distro for the Switch, it's called Switchroot
[08:04:18] <snake> "With all of this in mind, the GeForce Now leak has suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be released on PC on June 1, 2022."
[08:04:21] <snake> my wallet is ready
[08:04:32] <MootPoot> part 2?
[08:04:36] <emmeka> it is kind of sad how at some point Nintendo decided its route to profit was gimmicky consoles instead of powerful ones
[08:04:37] <MootPoot> emmeka: not bad actually
[08:04:37] <snake> just the first part
[08:04:44] <snake> part 2 isnt released anywhere yet
[08:04:49] <MootPoot> emmeka: I thought that was always the deal
[08:04:50] <emmeka> I mean, I get it, because it's working
[08:05:00] <emmeka> the Switch is the best selling game console of all time
[08:05:01] <MootPoot> nintendo never really competed on specs
[08:05:02] <amigojapan> snake: didn't you already play that on PlayStation?
[08:05:02] <emmeka> but still
[08:05:06] <emmeka> MootPoot yes they did.
[08:05:11] <snake> amigojapan, yeah, but i sold my ps4
[08:05:12] <S_T_A_N> I don't mind having a weaker console, if the games that come out on it run to a decent standard 
[08:05:17] <MootPoot> is this during the age of the boomer emmeka 
[08:05:18] <emmeka> the Gamecube was, by hardware, the single most powerful console of its generation
[08:05:21] <MootPoot> that was before my time
[08:05:24] <amigojapan> Ah ok snake

[08:06:27] <snake> amigojapan, yup
[08:06:30] <hans> i need an irc bouncher, any suggestions?
[08:06:30] <emmeka> MootPoot this actually caused all sorts of problems, when porting Gamecube games to PS2. The PS2 was spec wise inferior, and this caused some ports to lag or jank out
[08:06:42] <emmeka> an example I know of is Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life
[08:06:43] <MootPoot> huh
[08:06:46] <snake> one lucky lady from some country in africa got it for like 50% off retail price
[08:06:54] <emmeka> the PS2 version is a direct port with some bug fixes, but it lags heavily
[08:07:05] <amigojapan> hans: irccloud is the easiest. Lunarbnc offers free znc
[08:07:25] <snake> oh yeah i need to cancel my applecare

[09:10:27] <MootPoot> or obvious ones at least
[09:10:59] <amigojapan> I don't accept that as anime and ImoutoBot agrees

[09:11:31] <MootPoot> huh
[09:11:38] <amigojapan> :)
[09:11:38] <MootPoot> ah well - not like it matters
[09:11:46] <MootPoot> its a good show either way
[09:12:04] <MootPoot> gatekeeping what is anime or not dosen't really add/take away anything

[09:13:03] <MootPoot> the first part
[09:13:14] <MootPoot> the idea of 'accepting' a thing as anime or not
[09:13:53] <amigojapan> It's a Western production
[09:14:09] <MootPoot> yes, but how is that relavent to the quality of the show

[10:30:03] <SummerSkies> not necessarily for this
[10:30:28] <SummerSkies> this job should be hourly like it is, and this is one of the highest paychecks for a tipped job 
[10:30:32] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: Japan is a no tipping culture
[10:30:45] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[10:30:49] <SummerSkies> i never understood tipping 
[10:31:01] <SummerSkies> but I do like the idea of direct payment for quality from consumer to server
[10:31:33] <SummerSkies> it's just an awkward social dilemna of some people beginning to expect it or some people being dicks about not doing it
[10:33:01] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: when it comes to restaurants it makes no sense. I worked a part time job at a high end Japanese restaurant for a while and I got a ton of tips, but someone working at Denny's probably works harder and gets way less tip, cause it is a percentage of the food price
[10:34:29] <SummerSkies> why would someone at denny's be working way harder than a high end restaurant worker
[10:34:50] <SummerSkies> i could work at denny's

[17:39:49] <Cryowolf> curious to try it out so I ordered it
[17:40:05] <darkwitch> amigojapan, no, why? it's almost entirely water
[17:40:06] <Cryowolf> I did the same with this one Bco1981, https://www.maxgaming.se/sv/mikrofontillbehor-/mikrofonarm-svart

[17:40:11] <Pretender> Who is Tomako
[17:40:12] <Cryowolf> when it wa son sale for 170
[17:40:15] <Bco1981> why would you want that one ?
[17:40:22] <Cryowolf> Pretender, his wife
[17:40:35] <Pretender> Ah
[17:40:43] <Bco1981> the Gaming Handske?
[17:41:07] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, it creates an ergonomic support for your forearm and hand, it makes it so you dont drag on the mousepad and it has a surface underneath that glides
[17:41:24] <amigojapan> darkwitch: tomako says, that it might be fine for you then
[17:41:46] <Cryowolf> thats one of my pet peeves, when my hand and forearm glide on the mousemat
[17:42:25] <Cryowolf> if I can get rid of that and grab the mouse in a better more ergonomic way, while also getting less friction, why not? I'll try it if it's on sale anyway, 150 sek isnt that much
[17:42:37] <Bco1981> well it's prett cheap
[17:42:39] <Cryowolf> I mean it's 590 on full price
[17:42:41] <Bco1981> pretty*
[17:42:52] <Cryowolf> thats why I bought one on sale
[17:42:59] <Cryowolf> cause I want to see if it's good
[17:43:36] <Cryowolf> the microphone arm looked rather sturdy and movable so I bought it on sale for 170 (almost half off, now its 299 again) for my NTG-2

[17:46:04] <darkwitch> this includes things like coffee and tea
[17:46:22] <amigojapan> darkwitch: how about lemon and honey?

[17:48:23] <Cryowolf> whats in kampo?
[17:48:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the Japanese revised version of Chinese medicine
[17:48:52] <Cryowolf> cause it sounds like one of those "nature medicines" that's been approved for sale, but isn't exactly offered as a cure-all
[17:49:13] *** Quits: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.107) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:50:00] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: not a cure all. Each Campo is actually prescribed by a doctor and designed for certain illness
[17:50:01] <Cryowolf> when I look at some ingredients, it looks like what's in a lot of over the counter cough medicines. Some of them have ephedra which is prescription based in Sweden
[17:50:29] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: it's herbs
[17:50:40] <Cryowolf> google results tell me it's mostly effective for GI tract
[17:50:48] <Cryowolf> yeah but herbs can be very strong
[17:50:55] <amigojapan> Yeah
[17:50:57] <Sadale> placebo effect tho. Non-function med actually works.
[17:50:59] <Cryowolf> some can be very bad for you too
[17:51:05] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: different herbs
[17:51:27] <Cryowolf> Ephedra works for cough though, it opens up the airway and lets you cough up the slime
[17:51:37] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: and they underwent clinical studies, unlike the Chinese versions
[17:51:45] <Cryowolf> but there are other variants now like Pseudoephedrine
[17:52:22] <Cryowolf> but Epehdra has long been known to have this effect. It's even been made into a synthetic and much stronger version called Ephedrine
[17:52:35] <Cryowolf> and modified into a weaker variant to sell over the counter called Pseudoephedrine
[17:52:40] <Cryowolf> (in the US anyway)
[17:53:32] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: for some reason kampo comes in powder form
[17:53:51] <Cryowolf> I think they have to
[17:54:43] <amigojapan> To distinguish it?
[17:57:43] <Cryowolf> because then they'll be sterilized and checked so they don't contain any parasites, spores etc
[17:57:51] <Cryowolf> or other contaminants

[17:58:16] <amigojapan> I see
[17:58:29] <Cryowolf> if you can turn all those plants and stuff into powder, you can easily put that powder into a tablet

[19:22:34] <Jigsy> Yup.
[19:22:36] <TsundereNoises> like porn per capita or something, given viewership it gets lewded a lot
[19:22:53] <TsundereNoises> Anyway, not sure it's the best season to start, but it's also not bad
[19:22:58] <TsundereNoises> Mermaid is best girl though
[19:23:25] <Jigsy> I'd need 300GB of space to grab every single series.
[19:23:47] <zoidberg> Cryowolf: sailor moon
[19:23:59] <TsundereNoises> Why yes, it does take a significant chunk of my storage space
[19:24:23] <Jigsy> Currently watching Akagi.
[19:24:28] <Cryowolf> zoidberg, that "my work here is done" meme from sailor moon is wonderful
[19:24:32] <TsundereNoises> There's actually a good amount of plot in lots of magical girl shows, but I suspect cryowolf doesn't really care
[19:25:01] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: porn?
[19:25:03] <zoidberg> Hehe, yes, I like that one.
[19:25:03] <MootPoot> ok
[19:25:08] <MootPoot> I'm into precure now
[19:25:15] <MootPoot> lol
[19:25:17] <zoidberg> Lol MootPoot
[19:25:17] * Urchin[emacs] facepalms
[19:25:30] <MootPoot> Jigsy:  y'need more drives
[19:25:34] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, the question is if the amount of plot is a plot I like
[19:25:50] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I think it's because it's a kid show with enough of an adult audience, so it becomes a thing to make porn of it
[19:26:04] <Jigsy> Anything is pornographic if you try hard enough.
[19:26:13] <Cryowolf> saying I don't care is rather unfair
[19:26:20] <MootPoot> I feel like shows like this are copium for the overworked salarymen demographic 
[19:26:36] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: Well when it's clear how much you're just coming at things from preconceptions without having seen what we're talking about that's unfair too
[19:27:36] <TsundereNoises> I mean there are plenty of legit criticisms you could have, but that's not what it feels like there
[19:27:37] <MootPoot> nut in cute girls with the passion of the christ
[19:27:37] <emmeka> opinion: Steven Universe is a magical girl show for adults with a mature storyline
[19:28:17] <TsundereNoises> I still haven't gotten around to watching that and I really should
[19:28:25] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, yes it is...Not liking something is as valid as it gets
[19:28:26] <TsundereNoises> there's roughly a 99.99% chance I'll love it
[19:28:26] <SummerSkies> is it anime
[19:28:37] <emmeka> SummerSkies it's animated in Korea, so there's that?
[19:28:39] <MootPoot> I liked that camp show
[19:28:44] <MootPoot> uh
[19:28:55] <MootPoot> the one with the dorito boss
[19:28:56] <SummerSkies> emmeka: lol
[19:29:00] <emmeka> but Rebecca Sugar is god's gift to American cartoons, so who cares
[19:29:07] * Bco1981 orders another cpu+gpu
[19:29:15] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: not liking things when you're misrepresenting them and just spouting out your own weird genre prejudices is different than not liking things for actual reasons
[19:29:24] <TsundereNoises> I was joking early, it's perfectly fine not to like whatever
[19:29:35] <Cryowolf> what did I misrepresent? O.o
[19:30:02] <SummerSkies> my friend was telling me she's watching this anime from america
[19:30:06] <MootPoot> tbh I actually enjoy the subversion trope trope
[19:30:08] <SummerSkies> it's called Voltron apparently
[19:30:16] <Jigsy> 3>this anime from america
[19:30:18] <TsundereNoises> well for one, the easily defeating enemies with cuteness isn't really true of Precure at least, or really most shows
[19:30:21] <MootPoot> Jigsy: lol
[19:30:23] * Jigsy drinks his coffee slowly and angrily.
[19:30:33] <TsundereNoises> Many precure shows in particular do put a lot of time/budget into fight animation
[19:30:33] <SummerSkies> that's the joke you adopted clown
[19:30:40] <MootPoot> Jigsy: hey - the japanese call anything animated anime
[19:30:48] <TsundereNoises> now it might be a type of fight you don't like
[19:30:53] * MootPoot puts calming powder in Jigsy's coffee
[19:31:01] <SummerSkies> MootPoot and Jigsy are idiots
[19:31:05] <MootPoot> wha
[19:31:11] <MootPoot> :(
[19:31:12] <MootPoot> why me
[19:31:13] <TsundereNoises> likewise I feel like the sort of kid-tv lesson stuff is different than moe-power cgdct, although they're pretty similar
[19:31:18] <SummerSkies> MootPoot shut up and keep giving him your gay little powder
[19:31:25] <MootPoot> what
[19:31:25] <SummerSkies> im just playing
[19:31:35] <Jigsy> [16:01:01] <SummerSkies> MootPoot and Jigsy are idiots
[19:31:37] <Jigsy> Wow, rude. :<
[19:31:42] <TsundereNoises> but accurate
[19:31:44] <MootPoot> you should leave :<
[19:32:03] <SummerSkies> MootPoot i didnt mean it man i would never say that about you
[19:32:12] <TsundereNoises> I would
[19:32:18] <Jigsy> There needs to be TDCG.
[19:32:27] <MootPoot> I will sentence you to a world with no yuri TsundereNoises 
[19:32:32] <TsundereNoises> GASP
[19:32:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I would die
[19:32:38] <emmeka> is it an anime in the sense of animated series created by and produced by Japanese people, no. but just outright ignoring any animation not from Japan is a mistake, Japan has influenced American animation immeasurably at this point
[19:32:40] <Jigsy> A fate worse than death.

[19:33:18] *** mero is now known as MeroXmas
[19:33:41] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: even though there's transforming, I'd argue She-ra isn't a magical girl show though
[19:33:46] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, of course I haven't seen most magical girl shows. If there's a "darker" one, with more dread, despair, horror, sadness, anger, hatred and overcoming all of that to find some measure of joy and happiness again. Struggling against the world trying to hold you down. Then I'd give it an honest shot (which for me is 2-4 episodes)
[19:34:06] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I guess I have a narrow definition of the genre
[19:34:09] <emmeka> Jigsy did you know that the director of Avatar The Last Airbender made every single one of the staff watch FLCL before they started work on Avatar
[19:34:09] <SummerSkies> I can definitely like the animation style of early 2000 2d cartoons, that is what I would say is peak American cartoons
[19:34:15] <SummerSkies> they don't do 2d animation anymore though
[19:34:19] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: plenty of those
[19:34:19] <Cryowolf> if something doesnt have my interest after 4 episodes, I drop it. If I hate something after 2 episodes, I drop it too
[19:34:19] <MootPoot> emmeka: what
[19:34:20] <emmeka> sure they do.

[19:34:39] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: there are honestly TOO MANY darker ones like that, some great, some shit, and I was complaining about that earlier
[19:34:42] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], can you recommend me one please? A somewhat new one
[19:34:54] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: my issue wasn't your opinion, it was you just repeating uninformed prejudices out your ass
[19:34:57] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: they tend to be the somewhat new ones
[19:35:00] <Cryowolf> I don't want the edgy kind TsundereNoises
[19:35:00] <SummerSkies> emmeka: Modern day 2d animated feature films with full scale releases?
[19:35:17] <MootPoot> !g FLCL avatar production
[19:35:18] <SummerSkies> I guess there's always a chance I just haven't been hearing aout them
[19:35:19] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: FLCL - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL> | Production IG Mentions Possibility of "FLCL" Remake - Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/FLCL/comments/3j32j1/production_ig_mentions_possibility_of_flcl_remake/> | The Many Ways Avatar: the Last Airbender Remembers Love ... <https://ghostlightning.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/the-many-ways-avatar-the-last-airbender-remembers-love-for-anime/>
[19:35:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: Puella Magi Madoka Magica, for starters, a classic, make sure you watch first 3 episodes
[19:35:24] <emmeka> SummerSkies most good American animation doesn't come in the form of theatrical movie releases
[19:35:36] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I also drop shows a lot, I think it keeps me sane when trying new things
[19:35:37] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, is it necessary to talk with that tone? I mean would you think it was ok if I talked to you like that?
[19:35:50] <MootPoot> well..looking at anime movies emmeka I'd strech that to most good animation anywhere  
[19:35:57] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: and if characters seem to act like they're stupid, you're missing information
[19:36:02] <emmeka> SummerSkies but as to something recent, there was the Steven Universe movie.
[19:36:05] <TsundereNoises> Yeah Madoka is great but you NEED to get through the 3rd episode, people drop after 1 and miss out
[19:36:21] *** Joins: volki57 (~volki57@95.70.134.1)
[19:36:30] <Cryowolf> okay I'll give madoka a shot
[19:36:30] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: from my perspective you have a much worse tone toward me and things I like than I do toward you
[19:37:00] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: legal streaming is on Netflix
[19:37:03] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, I have never talked to you like that. At least not in the past several months
[19:37:07] <Cryowolf> like this year
[19:37:14] <MootPoot> madoka is the kind of japanese girl name where you KNOW you'll woke up drugged and tied to a bed in her basement 
[19:37:16] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I think this isn't much of a spoiler these days, but the first couple episodes of Madoka are kind of deliberately misleading, keep that in minde
[19:37:42] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: WTF?
[19:37:45] <SummerSkies> the collection of films that I have in mind is Iron Giant, Treasure Planet, Atlantis, Mulan, Hercules
[19:37:55] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: ?
[19:37:59] <emmeka> MootPoot I had to look it up to find the source, but it's from a Q&A with  Giancarlo Volpe at San Diego Comic-Con 2006. He was the director of Avatar, and said he ordered every single member of the staff to buy FLCL and watch every single episode of it.
[19:38:06] <SummerSkies> movies of that form seemed to stop
[19:38:19] <emmeka> SummerSkies ie, Disney works.
[19:38:51] <SummerSkies> yeah I was unsure if there are any of them that I like that weren't made by Disney but it's very possible they  made all of the ones I know
[19:39:04] <SummerSkies> emmeka: I guess it's as simple as I wish Disney stuck to 2d animation 
[19:39:27] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: Also putting Atlantis and Treasure Planet on the level of Iron Giant?
[19:39:30] <TsundereNoises> seems like nostalgia
[19:39:50] <SummerSkies> I think I would put Iron Giant quite above those two
[19:39:58] <TsundereNoises> I hate that Disney at some point rebranded to be more about princesses than they used to be
[19:40:10] <TsundereNoises> and I say that as an animated princess appreciator 
[19:40:20] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: as would I
[19:40:32] <SummerSkies> sometimes it feels like Disney peaked at toy story 3
[19:40:36] <TsundereNoises> and I think basically everyone who watched it as an adult at least
[19:40:44] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, I feel like I need to be shown and reminded of when I talked to you that way. Cause if I have in recent times talked to you that way, I have to apologize to you over it. Can you show me please?
[19:40:49] <MootPoot> madoka is a yandere name
[19:40:53] <emmeka> Disney is not the end all be all of American animation. I'd say the most promising studio of recent years has been Frederator and Cartoon Network Studios. You see the anime influence in the two heavily.
[19:41:08] <emmeka> I mean look at RWBY. It's clearly trying to be an anime. It even had chibi shorts.
[19:41:14] <MootPoot> canadian anime when
[19:41:20] <emmeka> there's plenty of Canadian anime
[19:41:23] <SummerSkies> I don't think I even know frederator but that definitely interests me to see
[19:41:31] <emmeka> I even know of at least one direct Canadian-Japanese anime collab
[19:41:36] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I don't have good logs and I don't care to search them but I'm pretty confident you've been rude before, also I think part of this may be a cultural thing, "talking out your ass" isn't that bad and is something I know I've said to like 10 people in the last 6 months
[19:41:43] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: it just means talking without knowing what you're talking about
[19:42:37] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I wish RWBY were less disappointing
[19:42:44] <emmeka> MootPoot Cybersix was created, produced and developed in Canada, but the creative team/studio was Japanese.
[19:42:53] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@181.114.17.106)
[19:43:02] * MootPoot does a double take
[19:43:08] <MootPoot> fucking mental autocorrect
[19:43:22] <TsundereNoises> Cybersex was created, produced, and developed in Canada
[19:43:25] <TsundereNoises> you should be proud
[19:43:26] <ButterNoodle> lol
[19:43:30] <MootPoot> lol
[19:43:32] <MootPoot> all of you too
[19:43:59] <TsundereNoises> I mean when you're cold and isolated from other humans it only makes sense
[19:44:33] <Cryowolf> I know I've acted rude in the past, to you and others. In this year though, after everything I went through. I've begun to realize more and more how pointless and wasteful it is to act like an ass to people for no good reason at all. So I'm pretty sure I've been an ass to you in the past, but I'm also pretty sure that this year at least, I've changed a lot and I haven''t treated you poorly. Also the talking out of your ass thing, in Sweden that'd be 
[19:44:33] <Cryowolf> something you say if you're in an argument or want to start something. It would be seen as rather hostile or demeaning
[19:44:37] <Sxem> teledildonics is about to explode, thx to covid
[19:44:42] <Sxem> invest now
[19:44:43] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm watching Cardcaptor Sakura, Li and Kero body-swap episode
[19:45:06] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: well I've also been around pretty sporadically this year and my memory is a bit shit at these things, it's possible I'm remembering something from over a year ago
[19:45:06] <Urchin[emacs]> Sxem: should have exploded last year
[19:45:28] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, okay
[19:45:42] <Sxem> it probably takes a while to develop new cybersex tech
[19:45:52] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: regardless I don't care to spend hours going through the 50% of the logs I have on this computer
[19:46:05] <TsundereNoises> which seems petty anyway
[19:46:05] <Cryowolf> Of course
[19:46:08] <Cryowolf> yes
[19:46:12] <MootPoot> Sxem: I'm about to explode
[19:46:21] <Urchin[emacs]> Sxem: there's already some, it's not like it's a new idea
[19:46:37] <emmeka> MootPoot I think at some point Rebecca Sugar even directly said that Steven Universe is supposed to be a pastiche of magical girl anime, she directly said the show was inspired by Sailor Moon and Utena.
[19:46:56] <Cryowolf> does Madoka have a particular timeline I should follow? Or do I go chronologically by release date
[19:47:20] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: from my perspective "talking out your ass" is at most minorly hostile. It's something I've said to my brother or my friends plenty of times. It's not exactly NICE, but it's less bad than saying "you're an idiot"
[19:47:23] <emmeka> chronologically, but of the movies I think the first is a recap
[19:47:33] <Sxem> i am watching a madoka-alike called Selector Infected WIXOSS
[19:47:33] <emmeka> you watch the series, and then Rebellion
[19:47:37] <emmeka> and ignore the spinoffs
[19:47:53] <zoidberg> Yes, IoD is the future.
[19:47:54] <emmeka> tbh, I'd say just watch the main series
[19:47:59] <emmeka> I think the movie was unnecessary
[19:48:02] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: the original show OR the 3 movies (the 1st 2 are retelling of the show), chronologically is fine
[19:48:15] <TsundereNoises> oh I thought the first 2 movies were a recap and the 3rd was new
[19:48:18] <TsundereNoises> am I confused
[19:48:19] <Sxem> is there any way to block ppl you have on ignore from sending you messages via ImoutoBot?
[19:48:23] <TsundereNoises> also yeah
[19:48:26] <TsundereNoises> show > movies
[19:48:26] <Sxem> do i have to put ImoutoBot on ignore?
[19:48:27] <emmeka> TsundereNoises no I think you're right
[19:48:28] <TsundereNoises> that I remember
[19:48:30] <Cryowolf> hmmm okay
[19:48:42] <emmeka> the recap movie was 2 part
[19:48:43] <MootPoot> Sxem: you better not :(
[19:49:00] <MootPoot> imoutobot is precious
[19:49:10] <emmeka> Cryowolf anyway, Rebellion is the direct sequel to the series and everything else is just spinoffs... based on a gatcha game... so ignore that
[19:49:11] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I'm pretty sure you won't like the 1st episode even if you like the show, sorry to harp on that
[19:49:18] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[19:49:26] <TsundereNoises> so series and then Rebellion (3rd movie)
[19:49:30] <TsundereNoises> ignore the rest
[19:49:46] <emmeka> Madoka Magica is a mystery series. Nothing is as it seems and you have to keep at it to peel away the layers until the big reveal.
[19:49:55] <TsundereNoises> Sxem: i'd talk to nano
[19:50:31] <TsundereNoises> It's also the source of the "But that's forbidden love" meme
[19:50:37] <TsundereNoises> that's not important
[19:50:51] * MootPoot wonders
[19:50:56] <MootPoot> Sxem: do you have me on /ignore
[19:51:05] <Cryowolf> so I'll just start at episode 1 and go from there
[19:51:12] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[19:51:16] <TsundereNoises> it's 12 episodes I think
[19:51:18] <emmeka> Sxem why, is someone doing this to you? feel free to pm me about it
[19:51:22] <MootPoot> I just realized Sxem dosen't really respond to what I say

[19:52:07] <TsundereNoises> it'll be sad if someone was harassing someone who was ignoring them completely by accident
[19:52:32] <zoidberg> MootPoot is a good boy.
[19:52:43] * MootPoot purrs
[19:52:44] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: Madoka: show then 3rd moviie
[19:52:48] <Urchin[emacs]> *movie
[19:52:59] <Cryowolf> third? not first two?
[19:53:07] <TsundereNoises> no, 1st 2 movies are recaps of the anime
[19:53:09] <emmeka> the first 2 are recaps, as we said
[19:53:10] <TsundereNoises> but with stuff cut
[19:53:13] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: recap movies I'm not too happy with, they overdid the backgrounds
[19:53:19] <emmeka> the third movie is Rebellion
[19:53:22] <Cryowolf> oh
[19:53:24] <Cryowolf> ok
[19:53:27] <MootPoot> is the thing about vampires having to ask to come in a eastern european thing
[19:53:31] <zoidberg> MootPoot: how come you‚Äôre still here? No work today?
[19:53:35] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: just as the backgrounds were too simple in TV version, BD version of the show hit a good middle ground
[19:53:54] <emmeka> MootPoot I don't think so. It's a trope I've heard before.
[19:53:56] <MootPoot> zoidberg: work is slow - they gave me 10 more things to do but extended their timeline as well
[19:54:02] <TsundereNoises> I love SHAFT
[19:54:10] * MootPoot gives TsundereNoises his SHAFT
[19:54:21] <ButterNoodle> shaft is nice
[19:54:38] * MootPoot is at work but he hasent started with his coffee yet and went to sleep at like 3am yesterday
[19:54:47] * MootPoot needs to be fucked into an awake state
[19:54:48] <TsundereNoises> get some coffee into you
[19:54:51] <Urchin[emacs]> speaking of vampires that need permission to come inside, Shiki

[19:55:41] <Cryowolf> shiki is the vampire show where the MC....changes
[19:55:45] <MootPoot> zoidberg: I already finished it - watched it while it was airing

[19:56:01] <MootPoot> send money
[19:56:04] <Sxem> i have snake on ignore and he knows i have him on ignore, but he still sent me an ImoutoBot message apologizing for calling me a moron
[19:56:05] <MootPoot> :P

[19:57:45] <Sxem> i think by apologizing for calling me a moron, he was really making sure i know he thinks im a moron, bcs he knows ive had him on ignore and complained about him using the bot @seen function to talk to me anyway

[22:10:03] <MootPoot> uh
[22:10:12] <Poeticode> i'm mesh balls deep into loose leaf teas nowadays
[22:10:14] <MootPoot> something common?
[22:10:20] <ButterNoodle> 300 WM
[22:10:22] <MootPoot> 30-06?
[22:10:24] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[22:10:33] <ButterNoodle> I mean it works.. its a great round
[22:10:38] <MootPoot> those rounds are such a pain to get stuff for...
[22:10:42] <ButterNoodle> but 300 WM is sexy
[22:10:48] <ButterNoodle> its pretty common here
[22:10:57] <ButterNoodle> its used up to elk
[22:11:08] <MootPoot> like, its common here as well but its always at inflated prices
[22:11:13] <MootPoot> compared to normal rounds
[22:11:18] <TsundereNoises> Poeticode: I love tea also
[22:11:22] <MootPoot> like 1.5x the price or more of 30-06
[22:11:23] <ButterNoodle> *normal = surplus
[22:11:39] <TsundereNoises> the secret is just to drink moar caffeine, then you can enjoy tea AND coffee
[22:12:15] <MootPoot> stuff that is common and not price inflated = 22lr, 9mm, .223, .224 , 7.62x39, 308,30-06 and 12ga
[22:12:18] <ButterNoodle> for sierra jhpbt MKs they are gonna be about the same $$
[22:12:20] <Poeticode> TsundereNoises damn i never thought of that. Or maybe have coffee and kukicha or hojicha
[22:12:33] <omero> at home, I use only the traditional stove-top bialetti
[22:12:34] <TsundereNoises> all of 'em, katie
[22:12:35] <MootPoot> anything else either load it urself or be prepared to pay premium prices
[22:12:56] <MootPoot> like those "premium nosler" something which is like 3 bucks a round
[22:12:58] <omero> its a moka machine, and grind coffee manually and mix it
[22:12:58] <MootPoot> fucccccccccccccccccck that
[22:13:04] <MootPoot> 50 dollars for a box of 20
[22:13:11] <ButterNoodle> trying to keep <MOA.. gonna pay for that premium stuff regardless
[22:13:14] <TsundereNoises> I love houjicha and genmaicha
[22:13:16] <MootPoot> I'm sorry I'm not made of money, I'm made of cum
[22:13:29] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: sell the cum for money.. stupid
[22:14:07] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: well premium components is one thing
[22:14:09] <ButterNoodle> *cum free and loaded here
[22:14:15] <MootPoot> they are like 20% more or so
[22:14:24] <MootPoot> premium loaded ammo tho?
[22:14:27] <omero> none of the home expresso machine are worth spending on... and possibly DeLonghi is one of the wrost
[22:14:27] <MootPoot> fuck that 
[22:14:39] <TsundereNoises> I don't think MootPoot cum is a premium component, seems more like a mass-produced store brand
[22:14:53] <ButterNoodle> buying a 1200 bolt gun and putting 800 of glass on top of it.. not gonna be an everyday range toy
[22:15:05] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: premium loaded 7.62x39 is like 3x the price of normal 
[22:15:07] <MootPoot> sad
[22:15:13] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: girls prefer volume
[22:15:21] <MootPoot> I would know, because I heard it online
[22:15:31] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: I prefer the premium, single sourced semen varieties to sell my seed to
[22:15:49] <ButterNoodle> all the rage with the ladies
[22:15:54] <TsundereNoises> omero: yeah, I don't care to bother with espresso at home, I'd rather just have it as a nice treat on a $1000 machine someone at a coffee shop paid for and have nice drip coffee at home
[22:16:04] * TsundereNoises has no idea what a nice espresso machine costs
[22:16:19] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: 2K
[22:16:20] <omero> TsundereNoises: at home the best thing is a moka

[22:19:49] <MootPoot> two
[22:20:08] <MootPoot> well I do pump through like 300-400 rounds of 7.62x39 every time I go
[22:20:09] <ButterNoodle> go to the 700 yard range and check sight and hold overs
[22:20:20] <MootPoot> about 2000-3000 rounds through my howa bolt a year
[22:20:34] <ButterNoodle> then burn up some cheap 308

[22:22:10] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I've kind of found that I'm unable to care about new vtubers until they've been around for a while and settled in
[22:22:22] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I think it's made worse by how rabid the internet gets over fresh blood
[22:22:38] <TsundereNoises> I AM liking this 6th gen "Minato Aqua" girl though
[22:22:44] <TsundereNoises> she's pretty gangsta

[22:23:50] <Nanobot> I like seeing new interactions. For me, the real debut doesn't happen until the collab ban is lifted.
[22:24:41] <TsundereNoises> I kind of get to the same place the opposite way, I think I don't care until the collab ban is lifted either
[22:25:18] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: a relationship man I see
[22:26:00] <TsundereNoises> yes, until the yuri ships are firmly established I have trouble caring
[22:26:40] <Cryowolf> collab ban?
[22:26:53] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises is the guy who hides in the closet while watching two girls make copius amounts of yuri together
[22:28:06] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: new hololive members are banned from doing collabs with senpais for the first month.
[22:28:16] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: new hololive vtubers are only allowed to collaborate with older generations after about a month
[22:28:26] <Cryowolf> oh
[22:28:33] <Cryowolf> weird
[22:28:34] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you know, there are a couple surprisingly good manga in that vein...
[22:28:52] * ButterNoodle gets out the main vein
[22:28:55] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: the idea is to allow them to establish a dynamic with their generation-mates and not get overshadowed by more established senpai
[22:28:58] <Cryowolf> you'd think that would be a fantastic way to introduce your audience to a new member
[22:29:19] <Cryowolf> I see
[22:29:23] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: but if you've been into it for a while, you just want to see them interact with your favorites
[22:29:39] <TsundereNoises> well usually right after the ban is up they have a whole bunch of collabs with older girls
[22:30:16] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I really like new dynamics that develop though, like the rise of MiComet

[23:28:43] <SummerSkies> I was born in 1995 
[23:28:59] <TsundereNoises> it is actually possible to read books that were published before you were born
[23:29:14] <SummerSkies> TsundereNoises: in most cases the book is better, it is the authors original idea, unscathed imagination fruit

[23:49:07] <MootPoot> I would say use firefox - but firefox is kinda shit
[23:49:29] <MootPoot> I guess you only really have chormium if you're into that FOSS shit
[23:49:55] <MootPoot> and otherwise vivaldi / opera me guess
[23:50:21] <TsundereNoises> browser war time now?
[23:50:42] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm sticking to firefox
[23:50:45] <Urchin[emacs]> and it's open source
[23:51:26] <MootPoot> if only firefox didnt slow down to a POS if you actually opened more then a 100 tabs
[23:51:43] <MootPoot> or you know - decent tab handling features
[23:52:40] <MootPoot> I went from IE -> netscape-> firefox->chrome->chromium->chrome->firefox->opera->firefox->chrome->vivaldi
[23:52:54] <MootPoot> vivaldi is the only one that hasen't let me down in some way yet

[23:54:57] <Urchin[emacs]> hi Llamamoe 
[23:56:33] <MootPoot> every time I use firefox it kills itself the way people claim windows does - slows down to a unusable POS  
[23:56:39] <MootPoot> over the course of a few months
[23:57:41] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: you keep one instance running for a few months?
[23:57:52] <MootPoot> sometimes
[23:58:00] <MootPoot> usually I restart my PC at least monthly
[23:58:10] <MootPoot> but even after a restart it dosen't really fix the problem
[23:58:20] <MootPoot> nor does a reset on firefox
[23:58:22] <Urchin[emacs]> I usually restart the firefox if it starts acting out
[23:58:39] * Urchin[emacs] shrugs
[23:59:46] <Llamamoe> Heya Urchin[emacs]
[23:59:51] <Llamamoe> I have my first ever job interview tomorrow!!!
