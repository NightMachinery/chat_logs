[05:03:25] <yanchai> hi guys
[05:03:52] <yanchai> what to look for if i want my django api able to push notification realtime to android app?
[05:04:19] <yanchai> i want to explore how to send realtime notification to android apps via django restful api
[05:05:58] <dang`r`us> I think if you google django push notifications you'll find appropriate libraries
[05:06:05] <dang`r`us> at least that was the case when I worked with that ~5 years ago
[05:06:40] <yanchai> also is it possitble to use mysql on my server rather than using firebase?
[05:08:58] <pembo13> yanchai, sending push notifications has little to do with Django Rest Framework
[05:09:29] <pembo13> yanchai, I believe use of Firebase is for sending the Android notifications, and is required
[05:13:58] <dang`r`us> mysql is possible but kinda discouraged; postgresql typical the DB of choice
[05:14:31] <dang`r`us> firebase might be required for push now; it wasn't back then
[05:15:17] <yanchai> the idea is to send notification to android whenever there are changes on my mysql database on my web server.
[05:15:34] <dang`r`us> https://github.com/jazzband/django-push-notifications lists GCM as alternative to FCM (Firebase cloud messaging)
[05:15:47] <dang`r`us> but you -will- need to register with -some- Google service; that's not a database
[05:16:04] <yanchai> oh cool
[05:16:45] <dang`r`us> I'd probably phrase this feature differently, you likely don't want to send a notification on *every* database change, instead on certain "events" (to use a random higher level term)
[05:17:01] <yanchai> i have a website running but just want to send real time notification to my android app. what i did is i created an api for my website and my android app
[05:17:26] <yanchai> yes thats it!
[05:17:27] <dang`r`us> ah, GCM has been discontinued it seems. So you will need a firebase key
[05:17:41] <dang`r`us> (in 2018)
[05:17:57] <yanchai> so using firebase for push notification only not related to database right?
[05:18:18] <yanchai> like my database is still from my webserver mysql just using firebase to push?
[05:18:31] <dang`r`us> yeah
[05:18:42] <yanchai> ok i understand thanks
[05:21:45] <dang`r`us> yw

[10:15:19] <dodo> also, pastebin.com sucks, please see /topic for the future
[10:16:18] <AugustusCaesar24> I know that username is wrong, but what could I possibly replace it with for them to join with minimal data loss and have the UserInformation model be a OneToOne model?
[10:16:29] <AugustusCaesar24> Noted: Ill use dpaste in the future
[10:17:27] <dodo> the core user model already has a username, you shouldn't have a username field at all
[10:25:36] <AugustusCaesar24> so if I want to create a OneToOne relationship between the UserInformation and the User model how can I do that?
[10:25:48] <AugustusCaesar24> I can get rid of the username field no problem
[10:26:20] *** Joins: Thanatos (~Thanatos@197.210.47.93)
[10:27:03] <AugustusCaesar24> I have to give the UserInformation user OneToOne field something for default because there are already rows in each model
[10:27:48] <AugustusCaesar24> I am sure there must be a way to do something like this, but I dont know it
[10:30:08] <AugustusCaesar24> I think worst case scenario I can set the default to null so all the existing data inside of UserInformation has null in their relationship, but then I have to go through the admin view and try to put a relationship between them for like 1k users and dont make any errors or else the integrity of the site is fried
[10:30:13] <AugustusCaesar24> but I think thats a bad solution

[11:08:27] <dodo> AugustusCaesar24: yes, nullable, and create a data migration that creates the information objects
[11:09:09] <dodo> or creates the connection as necessary
[11:09:21] <dodo> and once that runs another migration can change the field to non-nullable
[11:10:35] <AugustusCaesar24> dodo I found this thing called data migrations. Do you think that could help solve the problem and turn UserInformation into a OneToOne field with the User model?

[18:47:10] <pycode> hello everybody i am getting a strange behavior using multiprocessing inside a django command...are there any limitation?
[18:47:32] <pycode> because i am seeing that python script (memory usage) is growing
[18:47:47] <pycode> so for some reason it seems that py does not clean the memory
[18:58:14] <LordKalma> how do handle media/images on django-rest-framework?
[18:58:29] <LordKalma> do you have a MediaItem(models.Model)?
[18:58:34] <pembo13> LordKalma, define "handle"
[18:59:17] <LordKalma> like, if I'm on my frontend and I want to see what files are available...
[18:59:28] <LordKalma> do you just write a view, or do you write a serializable model instead?
[19:01:23] <LordKalma> https://stackoverflow.com/a/54059126/5168563
[19:01:26] <LordKalma> perhaps something like this?
[19:02:47] <pembo13> LordKalma, if you have a model, then you serialize it, if not, just a regular view should work
[19:03:09] <LordKalma> I still haven't wrote anything, and the media I need won't be part of a particular other model
[19:03:12] <LordKalma> so that's why I'm asking
[19:03:40] <LordKalma> I think I'm going with a model, like that example, feels more natural to me... I hope it's not hard to make a derived field with Pillow for a thumbnail :p
