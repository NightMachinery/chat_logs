[00:34:43] <bartolin> tbrowder: regarding the potential TLS problem with your site: This smells like a problem with an expired Root Certificate that is still referenced by your Let's Encrypt certificate. This is a somewhat complex, but IMHO this blog post explains it quite good: https://scotthelme.co.uk/lets-encrypt-old-root-expiration/
[00:43:24] <bartolin> tbrowder: As far as I understand that particular problem will affect mostly (some) old clients. But maybe that's the case here. You can see the problem with the following command: 'echo QUIT | openssl s_client -connect usafa-1965.org:443 -showcerts'. The last certificate in the chain refers to the expired DST Root CA X3. (quite OT, but since I read about this topic in September I thought I could mention it ...)
[00:44:25] <tbrowder> bartolin: thnx, i remember that thread from earlier but decided i couldn’t do  much about it at the moment.
[00:46:50] <tbrowder> i did a tldr on the link, but i don’t think there is anything i can do for my friends if they have probs.
[00:48:01] <tbrowder> but, duh, i haven’t yet tried access from my own mini (i mutter as i slap forehead)!…..
[00:49:08] <bartolin> probably not. Let's Encrpyt offers an alternative chain, but old clients will probably have problems with that as well (if the expired cert is the culprint). Upgrading the clients is the real solution.

[01:10:15] <japhb> bartolin: If only device vendors supported updates to older devices ....  :-(
[01:11:20] <perryprog> pretty sure macOS has a basic workaround for manually trusting a newer CA
[01:14:30] *** greaser|q is now known as GreaseMonkey
[01:17:43] <perryprog> I /think/ (take this with a large grain of salt) you should just be able to download the cross-signed .pem for ISRG Root X1 on https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/ and drag-and-drop that into Keychain Acess

[01:26:13] <El_Che> the only real solution for old clients that don't receive updates, like old phones. is root them and install a supported os
[01:27:57] <patrickb> How can I coerce a Str to an enum of the same name?
[01:28:47] <timo> m: say Bool::{"True"}

[01:32:34] <patrickb> timo: Thanks
[01:37:19] <tbrowder> perryprog: thnx, i can probably help the guys with that after i check out on my mac. BUT i powered up my mac when i left here at 1518 and it’s now 1602 and the progress bar under the apple looks complete but no further action!
[01:38:36] <tbrowder> the display, ms, and kb are on a kvm switch and it all powered up intially on it just fine…bummer
[01:41:33] <perryprog> tbrowder is that an update progress bar or just the "I'm rebooting" progress bar?
[01:41:50] <perryprog> if it's an update one, it can take quite some time. Otherwise I'd give it another hour before hard restarting it.
[01:43:04] <El_Che> my it-managed mac has an 18h record on an update (on a fast line)
[01:44:46] <El_Che> (I upgrade my work ubuntu way faster than that :) )
[01:45:13] <El_Che> tbrowder: in case you need to reinstall it, mac have a nice bootmode where you can reinstall it from the internet
[01:47:31] <tbrowder> ok, thx. so do you usually lv it powered on? i don’t normally power down except when leaving for for days away from home.
[01:48:14] <perryprog> Yeah I usually leave a mini powered on
[01:48:22] <El_Che> during the update, yes. Normally: no. It's laptop that I don't use often
[01:48:37] <tbrowder> and this is a brand new xperience fr me
[01:55:54] <El_Che> it's fun

[21:52:14] <algorev> Hello!
[21:52:26] <algorev> I need some help understanding the hyperoperator
[21:53:08] <algorev> As far as i understand it's kinda like zipping two lists together by applying an operation to pairs of elements
[21:53:17] <tonyo> at least you have somewhat of a reasonable expectation that when osx upgrades most of your stuff will still work

[21:53:57] <tonyo> linux update means i have no idea if my video driver is going to work
[21:53:57] <algorev> What i don't understand is: what is the meaning of the orientation of the guillemets?
[21:54:28] <algorev> How is <<+>> different from <<+<< or even >>+<<
[21:56:07] <algorev> Putting the guillemets whichever way does not seem to change anythingt
[21:56:40] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%3C%3C has some info
[21:56:55] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) >>*>> 2

[21:57:00] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) <<*<< 2

[21:58:16] <tbrowder> i don't know my mac os version, but i'll check...

[21:59:22] <tonyo> m: say (1,2,3) <<*>> 2
[21:59:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95164a768: OUTPUT: «(2 4 6)␤»
[21:59:39] <algorev> What does it mean, then, if you do <<+>> or >>+<<, for example?
[22:01:14] <[Coke]> if the lists are the same size, I don't think it matters with that operator. If they're different, you get a warning, or it loops.
[22:01:35] <algorev> I see.
[22:01:37] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) <<+<< (4,5,6,7,8,9)

[22:02:10] <algorev> Ohhhh makes sense
[22:02:14] <algorev> Ok thankssss
[22:02:33] <[Coke]> (ah, truncated is another option)
[22:03:02] <[Coke]> ... I agree this could use some better intro text on the docs site
[22:04:15] <algorev> I agree  that the  docs, while complete, are kinda intimidating
[22:04:58] <algorev> I mean there's all you could ever need
[22:05:28] <algorev> But my brain kinda freezes when i see sentences llike "Assignment metaoperators can be hyped." while being utterly new to everything raku

[22:08:52] <tonyo> the docs do kind of bleed a bunch of concepts into one another

[22:09:45] <Geth> ¦ doc: This is another false link that probably needs removing.
[22:09:45] <Geth> ¦ doc: There is no `routine_Str`or `method_Str` documented in `Any`. I could not find a single reference to `.Str` that I could replace the reference with.
[22:09:45] <Geth> ¦ doc: Removing the link does not seem to me to be important, but it probably should be an issue that `Str` is not documented in a single place. Strings and stringification are important enough to need a separate document.
