[00:04:14] <riv> I really want a physical copy of a book that I have a PDF for :(
[00:04:33] <riv> it costs about 50 quid on amazon, it costs about 15 quid to print on demand it seems - still too pricy
[00:04:37] <riv> it's annoying..
[00:05:00] <riv> i don't think libraries have it, i can't borrow from the university anyway
[00:08:03] <rwb> i'd go for the 15 quid option if you can. do you have an e-reader? i hear those are quite nice for reading too
[00:10:34] <rhn> corner shops should be able to print that for much cheaper, no?
[00:11:05] <riv> no e-reader, i can't decide if it would work for me
[00:11:14] <riv> rhn I will look into it!
[00:12:35] <epilys> buy used?
[00:13:45] <rhn> per page cost is usually low, but if you want it bound you're going to pay a bit more

[03:49:20] <quanticle> Why do you want sulfuric acid?
[03:49:33] <quanticle> Can't you use HCl instead?
[03:49:41] <quanticle> You can get that as drain cleaner.
[03:49:43] <mouseghost> why HCl?
[03:49:53] <mouseghost> most popular drain cleaner here i NaOH
[03:49:54] <mouseghost> is
[03:50:10] <fro> why did they forbid selling it there?
[03:50:23] <mouseghost> precursor for explosives afaik, fro
[03:50:29] <fro> oh
[03:50:36] <mouseghost> also drugs
[03:50:53] <mouseghost> well, its not a overall ban, but you gotta get it on invoice and overall be not a regular customer afaik
[03:51:04] <quanticle> Well, they're not wrong, but at the same time so many things are precursors to explosives that if you ban everything that could be a precursor to an explosive, you'd end up banning most useful things.
[03:51:44] <mouseghost> i also dont understand how that prevents anyone from getting it IF they wanted to do something, but w/e i guess
[03:52:07] <quanticle> I think the idea is that if you're buying it by the ton, they'll notice
[03:52:43] <quanticle> And it might be after the fact but they can use the info to track down who might have been making explosives *after* the attack
[03:52:50] <mouseghost> or like, ordering nitric and sulfuric acid and also toluen or some other shit in the same shop :D
[03:52:52] <quanticle> i.e. not prevention but capture afterwards
[03:52:54] <mouseghost> totally not suspicious
[03:53:11] <mouseghost> but hoooow
[03:53:20] <mouseghost> hmm
[03:53:23] <mouseghost> maybe youre right
[03:53:28] <edk> well buying nitric would be excessively stupid
[03:53:55] <quanticle> Well, like after there's been a bombing, they can go around to all the shops and ask for their records. That way they have a list of names and not like, "Oh yeah there was this really shady looking dude who didn't answer any questions, wore a hat and sunglasses and paid cash"
[03:54:31] <mouseghost> edk, why?
[03:55:12] <mouseghost> hm
[03:55:26] <mouseghost> yeah maybe it does make sense, afterall
