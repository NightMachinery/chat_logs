[08:18:52] <Sadale> newbie2021, jerking off to hentai ain't fucked up :P
[08:19:14] <Sadale> newbie2021, it's far better than jerking off to normal porn because no real human appearance is used for producing the hentai.
[08:20:13] <Sadale> Being a porn star as a human could make your life difficult if you get found out. Not to mention the STDs that you could get while filming.
[08:20:22] <newbie2021> Sadale: no. U r fucked up

[08:37:41] <luke-jr> newbie2021: liar
[08:37:44] <Sadale> Saxle, if your IRC client has autojoin, ensure that you'd join after you successfully identify. Otherwise you'd still be leaking your IP address.
[08:37:46] <Saxle> Can still see IP though on my end
[08:37:58] <Saxle> Oh really
[08:38:00] <Sadale> Saxle, yes. You can still see yours. But I can't see yours.
[08:38:08] <Saxle> Thanks Sadale
[08:38:13] <Sadale> Saxle, Try /whois Sadale. You couldn't see my IP address.
[08:38:38] <Saxle> dang can't hack ya Sadale :P
[08:39:00] <ButterNoodle> lol imagine not using a bouncer  in 2021
[08:39:00] <Sadale> Saxle, just to clarify how it works. Before you identify, there'd be no cloak. So if you join before you identify, people would see your IP address in hostname until you identify.
[08:39:14] <Sadale> Not using a bouncer isn't uncommon.
[08:39:14] <amigojapan> Saxle: you can't hack me cause I am using irccloud

[08:46:44] <newbie2021> Maybe it aged badly
[08:47:12] <amigojapan> newbie2021: I did not read it. But the acting it a bit exaggerated

[08:48:31] <amigojapan> newbie2021: I did not dislike dune
[08:49:37] <amigojapan> I read several Asimov novels too
[08:49:43] <newbie2021> Dune is just a pop culture thing. It's popularity blown up. Marketers did a really good job, that's all

[17:42:14] <MootPoot> I didnt want to buy it, but apparetly hue uses zigbee
[17:42:20] <MootPoot> not normal wifi
[17:42:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't have experience with docker
[17:42:53] <MootPoot> yeah docker is a pain
[17:42:56] <MootPoot> at least anydesk works now
[17:43:21] <MootPoot> so apparently
[17:43:29] <MootPoot> zigbee is some sort of point-to point wireless network
[17:43:34] <MootPoot> mesh 2.4ghz
[17:43:43] <MootPoot> kind of like wifi but very low speed
[17:43:53] <MootPoot> 240 or somthing kbps
[17:44:08] <MootPoot> so all your stuff just chain links itself to other stuff
[17:44:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the is for iot
[17:44:28] <MootPoot> yeah
[17:44:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's not like WiFi in it is not even internet related
[17:44:53] <MootPoot> so the idea is, the diyhub is on docker, it hooks into the hue hub which serves as the zigbee adapter kinda
[17:45:11] <MootPoot> so I can write what I want and make diyhub do it
[17:45:13] <amigojapan> I see
[17:45:29] <MootPoot> since diyhub pretends to be a alexa/google home
[17:45:48] <amigojapan> I see
[17:46:53] <MootPoot> the guy wants 125 for 3 lights and I'm offering him 150 for 3 lights and the hub
[17:47:02] <MootPoot> if I bought new it would cost...250-300 I think

[20:42:18] <Sadale> Bco1981, I've heard about that. But I'm not sure about the extact details. I don't think it affects Hong Kong SAR, China tho. That's because it's an SAR, that's a special administrative region.
[20:43:07] <Sadale> So the law there in mainland China wouldn't be applicable here. A separate legislation process has to be done here to ban mining.
[20:43:18] <sscout> I think they banned the legal exchanges, no?
[20:43:41] <Sadale> Not sure. I've only heard about that cryptoban on reddit. You have to ask someone in mainland China to learn more about that.
