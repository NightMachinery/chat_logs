[12:14:20] <p-i-_> Looking at https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html under Blocking (at bottom) it says 'SOCKS proxy handshakes' are blocking. If I use libcurl to HTTP POST, does this handshake happen only the first time (if I'm doing a 'warmer' POST and then later multiple simul POSTs to the same domain)?
[12:36:55] <p-i-_> I'm looking to find an engineer with libcurl experience able to take out a small project (boilerplate code to execute 8 simultaneous HTTP POSTs using libcurl using C/C++).
[12:37:08] <p-i-_> Can anyone recommend a suitable place to post up?
[12:37:53] <p-i-_> I floated a job on upwork, but I don't feel confident I'll reach the (few) engineers with this specific skillset through that platform.
[12:47:37] <bagder> socks proxies are not blocking these days btw

[13:26:26] <bagder> I've kind of started my xmas now so I'll be "working" for the next week or so, on and off, mostly off
[13:34:51] <p-i-_> How to build https://curl.se/libcurl/c/multi-app.html (ubuntu)? I haven't built C code in years...
[13:35:16] <p-i-_> `gcc test.c` gives test.c:79:12: warning: implicit declaration of function ‚Äòcurl_multi_poll‚Äô
[13:35:34] <bagder> do you have libcurl-dev installed?
[13:35:44] <p-i-_> Presumably it isn't finding symbols as I neeed to link libcurl
[13:36:28] <bagder> its a lack of a prototype
[13:36:35] <bagder> you might have an old libcurl
[13:36:41] <bagder> or rather I think you do
[13:36:53] <p-i-_> Maybe not... I installed pycurl with pip a while back & assumed it would be in the dep-tree
[13:38:16] <bagder> pycurl is probably just the python binding that will use the libcurl you have
[13:38:51] <p-i-_> Does ubuntu come with a libcurl preinstalled?
[13:38:59] <p-i-_> Looking at my bash `history` I've never installed it
[13:39:07] <bagder> possibly, but most probably not the *dev package
[13:39:57] <p-i-_> `sudo apt-get install -y libcurl-dev` throws a wobbly https://bpa.st/Y2ZA
[13:40:07] <p-i-_> Which of the 3 cands do I want? last one?
[13:40:16] <bagder> libcurl4-openssl-dev probably
[13:40:29] <bagder> its the most widely used one
[13:41:38] <p-i-_> https://bpa.st/7K3Q hmm, looks like my ubuntu box has it already (maybe c/o pip install pycurl)
[13:42:03] <bagder> 7.58.0 also says it is a fairly old version
[13:42:36] <p-i-_> So `sudo apt-get update -y` to get the latest?
[13:42:53] <bagder> I doubt that
[13:43:00] <bagder> ubuntu doesn't update its packages
[13:43:13] <p-i-_> Does that mean I should be building from source?
[13:43:29] <bagder> if you want a modern version, that's one way yes
[13:44:20] <p-i-_> But even if I have an old-ish version, I think I should be able to compile the example code, right?
[13:44:34] <bagder> not if the example uses APIs not present in that old version
[13:44:45] <p-i-_> oh gee.. that old huh
[13:45:12] <bagder> curl_multi_poll was added in 7.66.0
[13:45:32] <bagder> you *can* tweak the code to use curl_multi_wait instead
[13:45:42] <bagder> (added in libcurl 7.28.0)
[13:46:23] <p-i-_> ok I found some instructions here https://yannmjl.medium.com/how-to-manually-update-curl-on-ubuntu-server-899476062ad6

[13:59:56] <p-i-_> ok I've installed latest (7.70.0) on my system and I've done `ln -s /usr/local/bin/curl /usr/bin/curl` and `sudo ldconfig` but I'm still getting "undefined reference"s https://bpa.st/AKZQ
[14:00:14] <bagder> did you mean 7.80.0 ?
[14:00:34] <bagder> and a symlink for the executable won't do any difference
[14:00:35] <p-i-_> curl 7.70.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.70.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4
[14:00:44] <bagder> 7.80.0 is the latest though
[14:01:01] <bagder> I would be very careful with symlinking stuff
[14:01:35] <p-i-_> oops, I was being dumb. Blindly copied `wget https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.70.0.zip` out of the tut.
[14:02:00] <p-i-_> But those undefined refs are to curl_easy_init & friends.
[14:02:21] <bagder> yes, because you didn't use -lcurl 
[14:03:20] <p-i-_> `gcc -lcurl test.c`
[14:03:29] <p-i-_> ^ that's giving undefined refs
[14:03:58] <bagder> if you can't get that going, you're in for a ride
[14:04:24] <bagder> where is your libcurl and how does gcc find it?
[14:04:50] <bagder> you probably need -L
[14:08:46] <p-i-_> yeah that's why I was hunting around for someone who does this kind of thing for a living. I may have found an engineer on upwork.
[14:09:47] <p-i-_> I did `sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/curl /usr/bin/curl` so my curl is in both those locations, and /usr/bin is in my $PATH
[14:10:04] <p-i-_> Maybe I need to point gcc to the headers from the source.
