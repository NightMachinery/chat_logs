Money gives you freedom, and having a guaranteed amount will help you and your family.
[02:55:35] <Gustavo6046> Yeah I think he's shying away.

[02:56:01] <jim> what songs did propaganda make?
[02:56:09] <Gustavo6046> jim: my favourite is Pipoca com Guaraná
[02:56:20] <bilb_ono> I am making a unix style utility in python that works only by accepting input from stdin. I realize that I cannot use a debugger because the debugger interferes with the input. This makes me wonder how people that are making unix utilities generally debug their prograbms. Do they use print debugging only? Or are there somehow debuggers that work through various pipes, etc.

[06:52:13] <n4dir> with a backup it seems not too exciting an operation

[06:52:42] <n4dir> you can always change the repo later.

[06:53:14] <pnbeast> Bless, are you trying to figure out how IRC works by typing random things into the channel?
[06:53:15] <n4dir> though mint, i wouldn't expect any problems with any given mirror. To be honest
[06:53:47] <Woodsman> so im backing up to be safe, but when i upgrade to new version it will be just like my computer is now?
[06:53:50] <Woodsman> thats my question

[06:54:48] <n4dir> if you want to upgrade, that is a different thing. Not sure how Mint thinks about upgrade versus re-installation
[06:55:00] <Woodsman> well,no,

[10:07:54] <alkisg> Intelo: for example, old xorg programs like xterm etc have settings on their own; you'd change the fonts there;
[10:08:14] <alkisg> gtk based programs like gedit, pluma etc, respect the gnome / mate dpi setttings set in dconf;

[10:08:41] <alkisg> So it depends on the programs you're using, which setting they respect. You'd mostly want dpi
[10:08:51] <dieggsy> Intelo: I've Xft.dpi in .Xresources with some success before, or setting the monitor size correctly in e.g. /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-monitor.conf + some combination of GDK_SCALE and GDK_DPI_SCALE

[10:10:15] <Guest2026> I have trouble resizing a VM partition with gparted live cd. resize2fs fails due to I/O error and asks to e2fsck. After e2fsck fix this repeats over and over.
[10:10:16] <alkisg> The person there says that he ended up using Xorg -dpi
[10:10:28] <alkisg> Because xfce doesn't have good dpi handling like gnome/mate/kde do

[12:45:33] <xiaomiao> no that's just a convenient number

Looking for some suggestions as I'm about to run some remote training courses where my students need to work on the CLI through SSH, and I would like to look at what they are typing (and share with the others). My own ideas are either a tmux session I attach to or my own tmate infrastructure. If anyone have any suggestions, I would appreciate it.

[17:43:14] <Psi-Jack> What version of Debian?
[17:43:19] <kernel> buster
[17:43:35] <Psi-Jack> Stop giving names when asking versions.

[17:44:08] *** Joins: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman)
[17:44:40] <kernel> i change it: original line is: OIDENTD=/usr/sbin/oidentd
[17:45:00] <ananke> kernel: so you changed it and you wonder that it broke? don't. use OIDENT_OPTIONS instead
[17:45:27] <Psi-Jack> kernel: Hmm, wow. So debian 10 still used the init.d wrapper. Yikes.
[17:45:36] <Psi-Jack> Debian 11's fixed this, it's now a systemd service unit.
[17:45:50] <Psi-Jack> And...
[17:45:58] <Psi-Jack> Line 15 is NOT got the -a
[17:46:14] <Psi-Jack> heh

[18:09:23] <faekjarz> Which distro has the most feature-rich installer, regarding to setting up storage? E.g. the Ubuntu Server / minimal installer lost a lot of convenient features over the years. Is there a distro that lets me do whatever i want, like ZFS on LUKS, or XFS on LUKS without the LVM layer in between? ...from a nice TUI/GUI, of course.
[18:09:45] <peetaur> rapha: how do you use that syntax? show a command?
[18:10:56] <ananke> faekjarz: openSUSE has a decent set of features with its expert partitioner, but I'm not sure if it has ZFS. that's going to be difficult to find on most major distros

[19:36:35] <hexnewbie> sambauer: Giving management access to read the logs (including auth.log, the journal, as well as btmp/wtmp/lastlog which are recorded by PAM directly), is nice, whatever tool you liked. However, the suggestion here was to send those logs in real time to another machine, which is far from bulletproof, but you can't go in and edit the logs after the fact to hide an earlier login.

NVIDIA definitely works (even if I also steer clear of it, I help some coworkers who didn't listen to me to steer clear of it, and it definitely works fine), but it raises the difficulty level.

[23:12:10] <loquat> n4dir: apart from that the interview didn't go very well. I had prepared myself for more complex questions. It was just a general interview and the subcontractor assured me it wasn't a technical one. At some point they switched to a technical interview in english which is not my native language and I was with some cheap headphones. The guy asked me what would I do if the file system was full.
[23:12:12] <loquat> Assuming that I already knew the file system were full, I answered: well I would resize the volume with lvm but I simply had to answer him about df. I don't know if I will accept in case they call me back though. I asked them "what about the company laptop?" They told me if I could use mine and I was like: is this a joke?
