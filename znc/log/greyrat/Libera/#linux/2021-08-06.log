[00:22:51] <fakuve> I dont know if thisone goes in here . But assuming the good vibe we have in this Channel I'm gonna throw it in here :D . So in the shared directory of `nextcloud` if I have a certain Directory structure and I change it (keeping the files but in different directories) If I do that locally (in my Computer) then upon syncing the Cloud Server will understand that the files are still there and will just re-arrange
[00:22:54] <fakuve> them (not re-upload them) is it? I guess that is a basic for a `syncing` algorithm

[00:25:26] <ayecee> that'll be great for casual friday
[00:26:17] <ayecee> for that to work, it would have to find the matching file on the server somehow.
[00:26:34] <ayecee> in any of the directories of the share
[00:26:49] <fakuve> by filename , by any short of hash generated
[00:27:10] <fakuve> its quite complex the thing I dont fully understand how it works internally . There is a lot of `php` and `SQL`
[00:27:13] <ayecee> right, so it would have to build a list of all files on the server to compare against, for each file

[03:37:08] <ayecee> so like, start with the question
[03:37:12] <greatcoof> should i warry about those during artix install
[03:37:33] <ayecee> nah. you've already plumped for artix, how much worse could it get
[03:37:45] <rascul> i would be more worried about installing a half baked distro like artix
[03:37:54] <greatcoof> ayecee: i mean yeah ,lol
[03:37:57] <blackgatonegro> rascul some 486 computers that weren't pentium didn't work with the power button, the led indicator just changed anyway.
[03:38:08] <TJ-> earlier iptables issue for AsenM solved. the dport wasn't matching since a nat table rule was doing DNAT on the port number
[03:38:27] <rascul> blackgatonegro they did, you just didn't realize it

[03:39:47] <rascul> well i guess the switch itself also could have physically died
[03:40:01] <ayecee> well but then it wouldn't change the displayed speed
[03:40:16] <rascul> the displayed speed didn't mean much anyway
[03:40:18] <greatcoof> ayecee: so I didn't do something wrong?
[03:40:35] <greatcoof> ayecee: (other than installing artix :p)

[05:18:26] <blackgatonegro> Yeah is a bit confusing.

[05:33:09] <ayecee> more or less yes
[05:33:10] <mlu> in fact, the difference between a typical VM and Docker is that VMs provide a virtual hardware interface, while Docker provides a virtual Linux kernel interface (through the use of containers)

[05:33:18] <TheDcoder> That's cool

[07:08:12] <jaggz> tomreyn, in my system, with X, I often use "cmd | cx" (copy to x clipboard)  and "px | cmd"
[07:08:24] <jaggz> also let's me use, in text vim: :r!px to read it
[07:08:38] <tomreyn> okay, but you said you had no X there
[07:08:50] <jaggz> (since my terminal-based vim for some reason doesn't accept the x clipboard, even though it's compiled with it.. dunno)
[07:09:04] <jaggz> tomreyn, right.. so I have those commands which are convenient here locally, but not when I'm on a remote system without X

[10:22:22] <Psi-Jack> Well, contraversial nick, asking why his "blocking" style of /etc/hosts to block "porn sites", isn't working.

[10:22:45] <Sauvin> What's the "controversial nick"?
[10:22:48] <Psi-Jack> Pretty much an attention troll IMHO.
[10:22:56] <jochum> kk
[10:23:00] <Psi-Jack> Sauvin: Well, emacsvsvim. 🙂
[10:23:18] <Sauvin> That's not "controversial". It's just evocative.

[10:24:15] <tirnanog> not everything is guaranteed to use your libc-provided stub resolver, in which case /etc/hosts doesn't come into it.
[10:24:32] <tirnanog> or, to put it more accurately, not everything is guaranteed to use the glib name service switch.
[10:24:35] <Psi-Jack> Sauvin: No, I just look up things I don't know with google chrome, at webster. 😛
[10:24:38] <tirnanog> glibc, damn it.
[10:24:42] <Psi-Jack> dict don't use a proper dictionary. heh

[16:25:31] <sublim20> ubuntu might be a good choice velkro
[16:26:00] <velkro> thanks
[16:26:16] <velkro> and all those have good support, i presume in a sense of a very big userbase also?
[16:26:17] <n4dir> still i'd say it also depends on the knowledge you already got, velkro . debian sure is considered to be stable, but it might involve a bit of "action"
[16:26:32] <velkro> i like to tinker here and there, and learn a lot
[16:26:33] <n4dir> thats valid for both, debian and ubuntu too.
[16:26:55] <n4dir> the userbase part i mean
[16:27:01] <sublim20> ubuntu is what i recommend to people who want to try out 'linux'
[16:27:03] <jochum> I've been using Ubuntu for years, no fan of it anymore.
[16:27:05] <velkro> and what about opensuse, I read that one version is basically the enterprise version? how solid is that?
[16:27:16] <velkro> jochum why's that?
[16:27:20] <TomyWork> sreggin, that was the song i was complaining about
[16:27:34] <jochum> Friend of mine went with suse, he had lots of troubles with it (he good at linux stuff)
[16:28:20] <jochum> velkro: ubuntu, stuff changed, every release theres something else and the biggest thing - stuff like lxd is not for other distros just for ubuntu.
[16:28:20] <n4dir> we sure can exclude Slackware, Arch and Gentoo (and based on for all three). I would say.
[16:29:06] <n4dir> i think they have long term releases though, jochum
[16:29:11] <jochum> velkro: they invented LXD (i did some dev on it) - my debian server never got LXD, during that time snapd came - its bad in my case . no luck with it.
[16:29:29] <jochum> n4dir: yeah, but i want NEW software ;P
[16:29:43] *** Joins: rewrit3 (~rewrit3@user/rewrit3)
[16:29:49] <n4dir> jochum: ha. sure. But i think or assumed his main point was stability
[16:30:17] <sublim20> is it stability, ease of use?  what are the criteria velkro for choosing this distribution
[16:31:03] <sublim20> it sounds like they'll be people being plopped in front of a computer.  people who have never used linux before.
[16:31:07] <velkro> ease of use can be intermediate, I know how to read what installers want from me
[16:31:21] <n4dir> sublim20: in that case probably really rather something like ubuntu
[16:31:23] <velkro> but i can't fix stuff if i get a black screen after booting
[16:31:41] <clarity> velkro: That can happen on any distro
[16:31:46] <velkro> also it has to ne new enough so it supports enough software to not be obsolete (i'm learning development and data analysis)
[16:32:03] <TomyWork> jochum, suse is atrocious and I don't get why anyone actually likes it. I have to deal with it at work and installing anything but the most basic software is always an ordeal
[16:32:05] <velkro> clarity, probably, but i guess it happens on rolling distros more
[16:32:25] <jochum> velkro: i recommend you Ubuntu in this case, switch to debian when you like :)
[16:32:34] <clarity> Not in my experience, but who am I to say anything
[16:32:42] <jochum> ohh rolling - ubuntu is not rolling
[16:32:52] <TomyWork> debian's hard stance on non-free drivers makes it not suited for beginners

[16:47:45] <phogg> once upon a time fedora didn't even officially support upgrades, recommending to install the new version over top instead
[16:48:12] <n4dir> So that at max it should take you half an hour to put the system back on track
[16:48:20] <n4dir> say 1 hour, but not more

[16:58:08] <clarity> velkro: Ok, so that's fairly recent hardware.  If I had to guess, bad graphics drivers.  In cases like this rolling release distros can be better.
[16:58:28] <Khaytsus> luvalon1: Literally anything waiting for the CPU adds "load", so lots of waiting things could show a high load.
[16:58:34] <jochum> early pulseaudio = many crashes, some lag and other stuff.

[18:21:26] <luvalon1> webserver port open to public --> connecting from home to vps
[18:21:42] <luvalon1> webserver is container inside the vps, this one then forwards to the container running on same machine

[18:23:18] <ayecee> jochum: connecting from where, to where
[18:23:22] <jochum> luvalon1: so software listening on port 9000 is on host, webserver on container?
[18:23:26] <BCMM> rty: raising priority of a process needs root, and also just sort of pushes the problem around, e.g. your desktop shell might lock up instead
[18:23:45] <rty> BCMM: yeah, makes sense
[18:23:56] <luvalon1> okay wait ill do a graphic for you guys quickly apparently its a little confusing
[18:24:11] <ayecee> that's probably because of the words
[18:24:31] <BCMM> rty: actually, you don't have to run `nice` *every* time you start a build. you could, for example, open a nice shell
[18:24:48] <jochum> ayecee: I think he has Home->Internet->VPS->Docker->Nginx/Apache

[18:25:08] <rty> BCMM: what do you mean?
[18:25:24] <jochum> I'm not sure Docker->9000 or just 9000

[18:26:01] <BCMM> rty: well, i'm sort of guessing at what the problem might be. but if, for example, you're developing some software and you periodically have to rebuild it by running `make`, then instead of typing `nice make` every time, you could type `nice bash` once, and then do your development inside the resulting shell

[19:04:24] <ayecee> ah. i thought nginx was running on the host instead of in a container.
[19:04:51] <ayecee> luvalon1: do all your containers have 172.17.0.* addresses?
[19:05:06] <luvalon1> yeah but each in their own network (which is isolated)
[19:05:29] <luvalon1> to make them able to talk to each other, one normally exposes the port from contaienr to host, then it is accessible on host with that port
[19:05:38] <ayecee> okay, so you might have an input rule that allows traffic from 172.23.0.0/24 or whatever the subnet is, instead of -i lo
[19:05:53] <jochum> luvalon1: no you create a second network and let them talk over that.
[19:06:07] <ananke> luvalon1: you create additional networks, and have each container access those
[19:06:17] <ayecee> ick
[19:06:22] <ananke> docker-compose makes it quite trivial
[19:06:23] <ayecee> that sounds like a nuisance to configure.

[19:06:32] <ananke> ayecee: it's dead simple
[19:06:41] <luvalon1> okay t hats true, also possible, but even then, should it be like I said no? if I expose to host, then using loopback it should be accessible

[22:01:24] <BCMM> isn't there a tool that can watch evdev events? the name escapes me
[22:01:25] <ayecee> kapaun: i suppose you'd have to find out first how the mouse communicates events for those buttons
[22:01:29] <kapaun> My end goal is to remap the two keys on the left side (which send button 8 and 9) to the two keys on the right side and change the left side to type 8 and 9 as hotkeys for a video game
[22:01:40] <kapaun> 8 and 9 as in the keys, not the buttons
[22:02:13] <hexnewbie> kapaun: If xev doesn't print anything when you press the extra button inside the xev window, try “evtest /dev/input/eventX” where eventX is the device of the mouse
[22:02:25] <BCMM> evtest, that was it!

[22:06:42] <ayecee> sometimes they add these things because using one chip in human interface stuff costs less than having separate chips for everything

[23:01:29] <usr123> akk: Thanks. By the way, as a suggestion is it well worth the time to invest in tmux? The only reason I want it is so I can name my terminal windows so I can keep a track of what's running where.
[23:01:52] <usr123> And I normally don't work with a lot of terminals. Maybe two or three at once at max.
[23:02:05] <Psi-Jack> I use one terminal and one terminal only.

[23:02:23] <akk> usr123: I don't know, I've never used tmux. But I have a shell alias that sets the titlebar of the current terminal, so I can say titlebar gimp build for the terminal where I'm building gimp (or whatever).

[23:53:07] <usr123> To just have the host.
[23:53:16] <shan> rascul: right
[23:53:16] <ayecee> usr123: try this one: PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;what the hell man\007"
[23:53:21] <akik> this changes the prompt to greenish PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033[36m;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"'
[23:53:32] <rascul> shan unmount it immediately, the longer it's mounted the greater the chance of the data being overwritten

[23:55:38] <rascul> shan also your next step after recovering (or failing to recover) your data is to implement a backup solution, and test it
[23:55:44] <usr123> ayecee: Nothing changes.
[23:55:47] <ayecee> i missed a ' at the end, that's where that error came from
[23:56:25] <usr123> I added the ' at the end, and the terminal name doesn't change
[23:56:25] <ayecee> oh right, because bash's prompt command replaces that immediately after.
[23:56:52] <ayecee> try this then: echo -ne "\033]0;what the hell man\007"; sleep 60

[23:58:29] <ayecee> or some other string, just to make it clear that it changed.
[23:58:32] <usr123> I remove the one with sleep
[23:58:39] <usr123> removed*
[23:58:44] <ayecee> uh what? removed it from where?

[23:58:54] <ayecee> that was a command to run, not something to put in the file
[23:59:12] <usr123> Okay, I've been adding all the commands you sent to .bashrc
[23:59:18] <usr123> and opening new terminal to test it
[23:59:18] <ayecee> okay well stop that
[23:59:21] <usr123> I'll run it
[23:59:47] <usr123> Right, I ran PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;what the hell man\007"' , nothing changed
