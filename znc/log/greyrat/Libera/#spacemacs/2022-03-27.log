[01:08:10] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> oh shit, it's not identical, I have an org-plus-contrib package in elpa directory that sets `indent-line-function` to `org-indent-line` and should no longer be there I think. I guess at some point the default changed? Is that how people are writing org files now, with no indentation and enabling `org-indent-mode`?
[01:24:45] <FromGitter> <westrom:matrix.org> So for some reason, spacemacs will not respect my font choices. It gets the first one just fine, but for all CJK characters, it doesn't use my second choice. Instead it uses Noto Serif, which is in my fontconfig, but not listed at the top.
