[00:27:12] <skeemer> people is there any good book on game development
[00:27:17] <skeemer> also only 2d
[00:27:29] <skeemer> so that i can learn the various techniques used and so on...
[00:28:00] <skeemer> Icefoz, it is not possible to follow others while they develop ?
[00:43:20] <Icefoz> skeemer: I don't know.
[00:43:29] <Icefoz> skeemer: I am fond of this book though: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/ 
[00:47:30] <dthompson> Icefoz: there is no theme for the jam. pick a lisp and go ham
[00:53:25] <Icefoz> *oh no*
[00:53:30] <Icefoz> I better start thinking of a game design
[00:54:02] <Icefoz> Or at least a genre
[00:54:13] <skeemer> dthompson, any good book recommendations ?

[07:46:15] <Pixel_Outlaw> I'm learning Clojure for work. I wonder how the JVM is for action games. I can imagine the sudden jerk from time to time as it garbage collects.
[07:46:45] <technomancy> nah nowadays there's been concurrent GC for a good long whil/e
[07:47:28] <Pixel_Outlaw> It's been interesting, I still kind of like Common Lisp but I've not scratched the surface of Clojure.

[12:50:25] <borodust> i heard it uses not very conventional list heavy approach

[13:55:24] <Jach> skeemer: I read it, generally I liked it. It's fun. My main critique is basically the "list heavy" approach alluded to, and lots of functional programming style, like too many (for my tastes) inner functions with (labels...) instead of factored out functions, lots of caddr/cadr/etc instead of structs/objects/helper functions or even just second/third/fourth, a lot felt like a Scheme programmer forced to write in CL, and didn't stick v
[13:55:24] <Jach> ery well in my brain
[14:08:30] <mfiano> it's a decent book about lisp, and a lousy book on game development
[14:10:30] <Jach> Fair summary. The only 'graphical' game is porting one of the text games to run on a browser page, if you're not using CLISP you'll need to change some stuff for the server component.

[18:30:18] <borodust> Icefoz: yay!
[18:34:51] <Icefoz> I was resisting the urge to start work on it last night, too.  Never considered that an advantage to the Ludum Dare style where there's a theme kept secret until the jam starts, but it does make it pretty impossible to even plan for the game before it happens.  XD
