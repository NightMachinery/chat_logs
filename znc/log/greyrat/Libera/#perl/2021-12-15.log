[17:43:04] <hethw> question: can I use binmode in a tempfile() wrapper so that you can print directly in the predefined binmode https://perldoc.perl.org/File::Temp#SYNOPSIS
[17:43:05] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ File::Temp - return name and handle of a temporary file safely - Perldoc Browser ]
[17:43:31] <hethw> in the example you set binmode before printing

[17:46:47] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ File::Temp - return name and handle of a temporary file safely - Perldoc Browser ]
[17:46:52] <tirnanog> hethw: yes.
[17:48:34] <hethw> so I can set the default to binmode UTF8 for example
[17:48:49] <hethw> what's the scope of that?
[17:51:51] <tirnanog> binmode operates on the given filehandle. the scope of the variable referencing the handle is distinct from that, so returning $fh from a wrapping function would keep it alive unless the function were to be called in a void context.

[17:57:25] <hethw> so if I understand correct: I can make a wrapper around tempfile and set binmode utf8 on the filehandle in the wrapper and it will replace all previous binmode sets
[17:58:18] <hethw> and will therefore always write in utf8 in the filehandle
[17:58:44] <LeoNerd> Yes but you could also do that by a bunch of nicer ways

[18:09:52] <tirnanog> other than that, yes. you appear to have the right idea.
[18:12:48] <hethw> but sadly it's the other way around you first call tempfile and then print to it so all binmode sets will override the default in the tempfile wrapper

[19:07:19] <Grinnz> hethw: 1) always use :encoding(UTF-8) layer, not :utf8; 2) File::Temp tempfiles are always opened in binary mode, so they don't translate newlines to begin with. if you want them to, on windows you would need to apply :encoding(UTF-8):crlf
[19:07:36] <Grinnz> but it's unlikely that's actually necessary
[19:08:30] <hethw> about 2) you mean tempfile source sets binmode to binary somewhere
[19:08:34] <Grinnz> hethw: and 3) binmode does *not* replace the existing layer set, it applies on top, and some pseudo-layers affect the existing layers when you do that. see https://perldoc.perl.org/PerlIO#Layers for specific info

[19:10:17] <Grinnz> as long as everything using that wrapper knows that tempfile now expects characters, not bytes, that's fine

[19:11:38] <Grinnz> the worst that can happen is something is currently printing bytes already, so you get double-encoded output

[19:54:13] <Altreus> can I run perl -d and provide a single c, so that it doesn't stop at $global_phase++ waiting for me to tell it that I do, indeed, want it to run the program?
[19:55:36] <rindolf> Altreus: you can script the debugger
[19:56:54] <phryk> How do I access a package that is not defined in its own file, but alongside another package that is already being use'd? Perl keeps trying to load that already loaded package from its own file generated from the namespace and then falls flat on its face… :F
