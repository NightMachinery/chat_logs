[01:25:12] <alschaapman> It was my understanding that since the location with all the repository packages is configured in pacman as a cache directory, those packages will not *also* be cached in /var/cache/pacman/pkg

[03:26:40] <Namarrgon> ldiamond: you can add another partition after you wrote the image but that may disturb the partition table. it's usually simpler to install arch regularly to the device.
[03:27:16] <ldiamond> Namarrgon: yea it's a iso9660 partition on the full device.
[03:28:00] <ldiamond> I wanted to do a backup of a laptop with dd on a SSD and thought I could use the arch install iso directly on the ssd itself.
[03:29:28] <ldiamond> But I just noticed (might be new) that you can now boot the install with "copy to ram" option, which I assume means I can easily remove the USB device (or format the SSD)
[03:29:50] <Namarrgon> the laptop has only a single usb port?
[03:30:01] <Namarrgon> ah, nvm
[03:31:18] <kevr> earnestly: apologies, i just realized that i took that out of context 100%.

[06:26:09] <kevr> Feuermagier: So, with MST, the OS does require a compatible driver to be able to utilize it. That was not always in the Linux kernel, and this may be the problem at hand possibly. I do believe it is supported now, but, perhaps there's something with the device in question not working out.
[06:26:17] <kevr> like a udev rule or something like this.
[06:26:35] <kevr> The main OS that supported MST at its beginning was Windows; mac didn't even support it for a long ass time.
[06:26:55] <thurstylark> fenugrec: pipewire might be for you, then 
[06:26:59] <kevr> kernel logs will give us as many details that the kernel knows

[06:27:35] <thurstylark> it helps that I've been waist-deep in my own pipewire rabbit hole too :P
[06:27:38] <kevr> i gotcha
[06:27:59] <kevr> so let's take a look at the logs and see what they say; we may be able to find the issue in there.
[06:28:23] <ponies> fenugrec: journalctl -k
[06:29:41] <fenugrec> I'm reading up on it, but TBH even after years of mucking with linux I still don't know how alsa and pulse even fit together. alsa has kernel-level stuff, but pulseaudio is "a middleware between apps and ahrdware devices, using ALSA or OSS", but "pulseaudio builds only on the kernel component, but ....." ...

[06:41:28] <Feuermagier> kevr, yes. behaviour gets weird if i unplug them while the system is running. cables are display port to DVI adapters, but these come after the splitter. The splitter is connected directly to the mainboard
[06:41:30] *** Joins: obale (~obale@user/obale)
[06:41:39] <kevr> that might be an issue
[06:42:00] <thurstylark> that's definitely an issue
[06:42:05] <Feuermagier> kevr, no. I have my main display connected via HDMI and the splitter to the single DP output of the mainboard
[06:42:06] <kevr> the monitors also need to support MST for it to work at all, as far as i'm reading. that doesn't explain though why it _was_ working for you at one point.
[06:42:13] <kevr> hmm.
[06:42:27] <kevr> and for MST to be supported, it has to be over DP 1.2
[06:42:45] <kevr> DP 1.2 -> DVI is not supplying the display with DP 1.2.
[06:42:48] <thurstylark> afaik DP *emulates* those connections to allow passive adapters
[06:43:02] <thurstylark> you're losing all the DP fun bits 
[06:43:13] <kevr> hm..
[06:43:53] <Feuermagier> kevr, my guess is that the splitter handles everything up to itself with DP 1.2 (mainboard supports DP 1.2). What comes after the splitter is hopefully managed correctly *by* the splitter.
[06:44:07] <kevr> Feuermagier: frankly, i'm not really seeing blazing issues in any of your logs, and i don't have anything that supports MST and have never used it; i think at this point, i'm not really sure how to help you more here, other than googling.

[06:51:20] <kevr> fsck is failing to restore things?
[06:51:21] *** Quits: kj7rrv (~kj7rrv@user/kj7rrv) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:51:28] <Dr-008> but this is missing. also cabled internet is a no go, or at least im not familair with the `ip` commands
[06:51:31] <thrice> Dr-008: well, two possibilities.  There is no networking tool (wireless, dhcp client) by default.  If you installed them, and your network interface isn't there, perhaps you forgot linux-firmware

[06:51:55] *** Joins: kj7rrv (~kj7rrv@user/kj7rrv)
[06:52:04] <Dr-008> i installed linux-firmware, but maybe its missing. but pacman is new to me
[06:52:06] <Feuermagier> kevr, no. I have not run it yet. But are there other reasons for filesystem errors to occur?
[06:52:17] *** Joins: J_Darnley (~J_Darnley@d51A44418.access.telenet.be)
[06:52:26] <kevr> ah, gotcha
[06:52:36] <kevr> yeah, when you turn off your computer without gracefully powering down
[06:52:40] *** Joins: MercilessDeth (~brad@136.49.59.177)
[06:52:44] <kevr> the next fsck will restore inodes most of the time
[06:52:52] <Feuermagier> ah, I guess mine has seen a few powerouts
[06:52:53] <Dr-008> thrice, do you know how i could fix this now? i dont mind reinstalling, but im certain i installed this package
[06:52:59] <thrice> Dr-008: well, systemd-networkd is available by default.  I haven't used it, but I think a small config will work:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-networkd#Wired_adapter_using_DHCP
[06:53:01] <phrik> Title: systemd-networkd - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[06:53:12] <Feuermagier> kevr, should it always run at boot? - or does that take a lot of time?
[06:53:17] <Dr-008> ok thanks
[06:53:18] <thrice> (for wired)
[06:53:31] <kevr> i would suggest running it at boot. it does take some time, but not a lot.
[06:53:40] <thrice> Dr-008: if you plan to use gnome or kde, you'll likely switch to networkmanager
[06:54:14] <kevr> then you dont have to worry about doing it manually.
[06:54:23] <Dr-008> thrice, well. ive installed ubuntu, debian, fedora and now archlinux. i think im going to keep arch all text based
[06:54:34] <Dr-008> ubuntu = gnome, debian = kde
[06:54:41] <Dr-008> i believe there was a third
[06:54:50] <Dr-008> which is fitting for your name
[06:55:02] <Dr-008> but im sure there's also a fourth and fifth ;)
[06:55:10] *** Joins: mrbanie (~mrbanie@user/mrbanie)
[06:55:10] <thrice> well, even if you want wireless, networkmanager is pretty nice, and comes with a terminal client
[06:55:24] <thrice> but, if it's always wired, that wiki page is the simplest approach
[06:55:33] <thrice> or, *a* simple approach
[06:55:45] <Dr-008> nah, its not always wired. but then i can install iwconfig via pacman
[06:55:46] <Dr-008> so thanks
[06:56:03] <thrice> iwconfig will not likely solve your problem
[06:56:37] <thrice> if it's encrypted, you'll need something like wpa_supplicant or iwd to authenticate
[06:57:03] <Dr-008> also, there's no vi or nano. so should i all `echo "settings" >> config.file.something` for now? or is there another tool

[06:57:58] <fenugrec> Dr-008, not sure if 'ed' is included by default P )
[06:58:14] <thrice> you can also just boot the arch iso, mount your partitions, and chroot in there (skip the formatting / pacstrap part of the install guide)
[06:58:51] <Dr-008> thrice, nope. i thought i could do this once i was booted up into it. but you see how i cant. but i will
[06:59:06] <Dr-008> ah
[06:59:07] <Dr-008> nice
[06:59:25] <Dr-008> then i will do that and google some more on my phone

[12:06:20] <roxlu> hi, a couple of weeks ago I updated my arch install after which I couldn't start i3 anymore; I couldn't really figure out why and as quickfix I reinstalled packages up to a certain date. Now I've got a bit more time and want to do a full update again.
[12:06:41] <roxlu> is there anything which would allow me to go back to the current state of my install when something fails?
[12:07:03] <jensen> Let me know if anyone is experiencing occasional flashing and potential performance issues lately on Firefox (I'm on Sway/Wayland, stock kernel, AMD, i5-2500k)
[12:09:02] <beastDivision> Overl: maybe check if you have secure boot enabled preventing you from selecting the disk, also make sure it is properly bootable for your setup, ie, MBR/UEFI etc
[12:09:11] <jensen> roxlu: if you're only concerned about what you're installing, just refer to /var/log/pacman.log to see what you've installed/uninstalled
[12:09:27] <beastDivision> the wiki walks you through a bunch of different configurations for dual booting Overl 
[12:09:44] <Foxboron> roxlu: not without doing lvm/btrfs/zfs snapshots of the system
[12:09:53] <roxlu> ok thanks jensen and Foxboron 
[12:10:11] <Foxboron> roxlu: generally you can use the archive to revert package states
[12:10:21] <Foxboron> but it's better to just figure out the underlying issue
[12:10:36] <Overl> oh, I found it. Its not in the big priority list but in some small submenu... thanks though for trying to help beastDivision 
[12:10:40] <roxlu> I updated a similar PC recently which did work and I was thinking that it could be because the working PC had no `nomodeset` kernel option.

[14:06:35] <Khorne> Yea :)
[14:06:51] <beastDivision> I generally woulnd't recommend trying to use special fonts or fancy output in a barebones hardware terminal out. those thigns are best left to an emulator, unless you like got really good reason too 
[14:06:56] <overl> oh yea... on the laptops tty its fudged too... my bad

[22:37:35] <th0rne> I think also worth pointing out is that your mileage probably most depends on where you're coming from.
