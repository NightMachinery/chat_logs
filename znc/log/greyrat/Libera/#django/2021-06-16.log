[02:57:58] <zamba> hi! i have the models Event, Run, Runner and Result.. one Event can have several Run(s) and each Run will usually have a set of results, with runners and their corresponding time..
[02:58:26] <zamba> now i want to create an event detail page.. where i want to display all the runs for that event and get the results for that run
[02:58:34] <zamba> but how should i write the query for that?
[02:58:53] <zamba> right now i have the following under get_context_data(): runs = Run.objects.filter(event=self.event).order_by("distance")
[02:59:00] <zamba> which works as expected
[02:59:27] <zamba> but i want to also have a queryset under each of the Run objects that lists the order of the results

[07:23:58] *** Joins: sadg (~odd@45.83.220.210)
[07:24:19] <FunkyBob> mihael: it merely means that class is defined within the other classes namespace
[07:24:33] <FunkyBob> as a property of that class
[07:24:40] <mihael> Ah, so it's just a scoping mechanism
[07:25:03] <FunkyBob> much like in the django tutorial you'll see class Meta defined inside a model or form class
[07:25:54] <mihael> Ah so that class will become a property of the containing class
[07:26:31] <mihael> FunkyBob have you tried implementing multiple user types via proxy? what do you think of it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0hdXr2MOEA

[08:18:15] <FunkyBob> mihael: what "multiple user types" do you have/need?
[08:18:35] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: it's not the one function I asked you to describe, but the whole workflow.
[08:18:54] <wallbroken> however it has become frustrating and depressing for me to pray for someone to help me. so i will ask if anyone is willing to develop the paid feature
[08:19:48] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: it's the common flow implemeneted to each website
[08:20:11] <wallbroken> and "the whole workflow" is what i described
[08:20:40] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yeah, we've been through this before... what you think is common knowlege, isn't. so I asked you to be clear and explicit .. and document the whole workflow
[08:20:53] <FunkyBob> but you claimed you didn't understand what Iwas asking for
[08:21:15] <wallbroken> are you serious?
[08:21:25] <FunkyBob> very
[08:21:36] <wallbroken> have you ever needed to update your email to amazon or whatever website?
[08:21:44] <wallbroken> you didn't see what happens?
[08:21:49] <mihael> FunkyBob, so right now I have a User which container the authentication fields(email, passwrd, username, etc.) That user can be an admin, Player, Coach, a normal user. Each user can only assume one role
[08:22:15] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: irrelevant. if you want someone to implement this for you, you will need to clearly describe what you want
[08:22:26] <wallbroken> i already did
[08:22:37] <wallbroken> i access to management form page
[08:22:40] <wallbroken> update the email

[08:23:15] <FunkyBob> again, don't document it here in IRC... it will get lost
[08:23:33] <wallbroken> why are you asking to me to make this?
[08:23:57] <FunkyBob> I said -- if you want someone else to write this for you, they will need to know this
[08:24:28] <FunkyBob> I originally asked you to document this so I could walk you through implementing the solution
[08:24:37] <FunkyBob> but you spent all your efforts fighting me instead...
[08:25:19] <FunkyBob> mihael: ok... so you have a 'role' field on the user?
[08:25:38] <mihael> FunkyBob Currently, I dont
[08:25:59] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/g2gz
[08:26:38] <FunkyBob> mihael: so what differentiates these users?
[08:27:26] <mihael> before I just needed to differentiate between admin and not, so I only have the is_admin boolean field
[08:27:31] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: well, that's progress... now include all the checks/vaalidations the server will need to make... where it can fail/error/break
[08:27:58] <wallbroken> validations??
[08:28:01] <mihael> but now, since there are 4 types, I wanted to implement different User type, which is what i'm looking into right now on how to do
[08:29:59] <FunkyBob> mihael: do you need to store different details about each?
[08:30:08] *** Quits: summersault (~summersau@179.221.251.16) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:31:03] <mihael> FunkyBob Yeah, I do
[08:32:16] <FunkyBob> mihael: directly on the user model, or on related models?
[08:32:40] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: what are you asking to me?
[08:33:31] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yesterday you said the code needed to check various things... like that the new email was unique, and so on... that's not in your current workflow description
[08:34:07] <wallbroken> yes
[08:34:18] <wallbroken> i just told if it's possible to check that email is unique
[08:35:53] <mihael> FunkyBob so each User Type like Player will have its own unique details specific for them
[08:36:32] <FunkyBob> mihael: yes... looking for a little more detail than that :)
[08:38:45] <mihael> I'm sorry for the vagueness, each user will have different fields: https://dpaste.org/K21D there will be more though
[08:40:04] <FunkyBob> so, Player and coach will both have team_name... shouldn't there be a Team record, instead?
[08:41:03] <mihael> FunkyBob ah yeah, there will be a relationship between a Team class/model to that
[08:42:19] <mihael> I'm confused how should I go on deploying/implementing the different user types. Can you give me an example or point me to the right direction please

[08:42:52] <FunkyBob> a lot of the time I find either it can be inferred from related data, or you add a role / user-type field

[08:46:41] <FunkyBob> mihael: well, either you can, for instance, tell they're a Coach for a Team because Team.coach fkeys to them...
[08:46:52] <FunkyBob> or they're a player becuse they're in a Team.players m2m relation
[08:47:00] <FunkyBob> that's -inferred- roles
[08:47:06] <mihael> How do I implement the different User Types?
[08:47:16] <FunkyBob> explicit is to add a field to your User model with role = ... and a list of choices
[08:47:22] <FunkyBob> mihael: you.. don't
[08:48:42] <mihael> ah so Under my User model, I can define a class Role that will allow me to select which type of user it would be, but how would I implement the unique fields for each user type?

[08:49:15] *** Joins: stwe (~sw@p5b0637a6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[08:49:23] <FunkyBob> as is often the case the answer is "it depends"
[08:49:29] <FunkyBob> on what they are, what they mean
[08:49:42] <FunkyBob> so I ask for more details so we can figure that out
[08:50:40] <mihael> so a Player will have a Player Profile(kind of), which will contain player specific info like their total scores, total blocks, etc.
[08:51:10] <mihael> a Coach will have different Profile like their current season, etc.
[08:51:15] <FunkyBob> so  you're not storing their stats per game, for instance?
[08:51:26] <FunkyBob> total scores would be the sum of scores over their games, yes?
[08:51:42] <mihael> For now, not per game.
[08:51:47] <mihael> Yes, the sum of scores over their games
[08:53:09] <wallbroken> ok, you stopped answering
[08:53:54] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: did you update the workflow?
[08:54:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: if you feel you can hand that document off to someone and be certain you'll get back what you want... then it's complete
[08:55:01] <FunkyBob> but what I saw was nowhere near detailed enough
[08:55:25] <FunkyBob> but hey, it's your money
[08:55:40] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/Q2C4
[08:55:54] <FunkyBob> mihael: yeah, so in that case eventually you'd have a Match and some sort of PlayedIn record showing the stats of that player in that match, etc...
[08:56:14] <FunkyBob> mihael: so those unique fields aren't actually stored on the User record, but instead calculated from related records

[10:33:07] <PaulWay[w]> And I already have more than enough work for myself and my work on Django thanks.
[10:33:07] <bparker> also known as most specifications
[10:33:12] <PaulWay[w]> Maybe.
[10:33:20] <PaulWay[w]> I've got two models, a Host and an InventoryHost, linked by a OneToOneField from Host to InventoryHost.
[10:34:00] <wallbroken> my specifications are logically clear. and are common.
[10:34:06] <PaulWay[w]> We don't control the InventoryHost table (long story), so we have Host's `inventory` field set to `on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING`.
[10:34:15] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: not from everything I've seen.
[10:34:56] <wallbroken> the design of the application in my mind is clear
[10:35:04] <bparker> key words there
[10:35:07] <bparker> in my mind
[10:35:26] <PaulWay[w]> I've discovered that if I have a Host with no matching InventoryHost, I cannot find that record using Host.objects.filter(inventory__isnull=True).
[10:35:52] <PaulWay[w]> Because (AFAICS because of the OneToOneField) it does an INNER JOIN, which unsurprisingly is never null.
[10:36:24] <bparker> if you had on_delete=models.SET_NULL then that filter would probably work.
[10:36:37] <PaulWay[w]> Ahhhh, interesting.
[10:36:49] <PaulWay[w]> Except for the fact that I need to find that host by its primary key...
[10:37:02] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: you've spent all this time asking us questions, surely you've developed some skills at Django by now.
[10:37:19] <PaulWay[w]> You've been reading the documentation, refining your code, learning how it all works.
[10:37:25] <wallbroken> no, i'm not an experienced django developer
[10:37:44] <wallbroken> i have very base skills
[10:37:53] <PaulWay[w]> That's where we all started.

[10:38:01] <bparker> when I had a similar situation with a table on another (read-only) host, I (naively) kept two fields... the primary id key with on_delete=SET_NULL, but also another id field that was just IntegerField that had the database id in it
[10:38:17] <bparker> set when the record was added
[10:38:29] <bparker> so that I could easily tell what was deleted and what the original id was
[10:38:35] <PaulWay[w]> Right.  So you thought they'd be the same all the time?
[10:39:15] <bparker> well they were since nothing was ever blown away or indexes reset, it worked enough for that application
[10:40:04] <PaulWay[w]> What I've had to do is something like Host.objects.filter(account=this_acct).exclude(id__in=InventoryHost.objects.filter(account=this_acct).values('id'))
[10:40:28] <PaulWay[w]> OK, from your use of the word 'naively' I thought there was a problem.  Or is that coming up?
[10:40:49] <bparker> nah just saying it was a dumb solution but was Good Enough (TM)
[10:40:56] <PaulWay[w]> Fair.
[10:41:09] <PaulWay[w]> Now, the real fun is that I have a Plan model, with many Action models, and each action has a Host.
[10:41:30] *** Joins: sbmsr (~pi@2600:1700:63d0:4830:7dbf:92d8:fd42:235d)
[10:42:02] <PaulWay[w]> I'm now trying to work out how to filter the plans so their actions only show hosts in the inventory.
[10:42:14] <PaulWay[w]> And then filter out plans that have no actions by that filter....
[10:43:49] <bparker> and in similar fashion you're having rows deleted with no FK constraints enforced?
[10:44:26] <PaulWay[w]> Well, the action points to the host, which still exists.
[10:44:37] <PaulWay[w]> Hmmmm - if I do the former, it's OK to show plans with no (unfiltered) actions.
[10:46:04] <bparker> I guess you could do Plan.objects.exclude(action__inventoryhost__id__in=...) like above
[10:46:16] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[10:46:29] <PaulWay[w]> Is that a filter on the plan, or the action?
[10:46:37] <bparker> plan
[10:46:54] <PaulWay[w]> Because if a plan had two actions, one on a current host and one on a deleted host, I suspect that that filter would exclude the plan entirely.
[10:47:18] <PaulWay[w]> I'm going to have to go, I'll resume the research tomorrow.
[10:47:18] <bparker> oh, plans can have multiple actions?
[10:47:22] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[10:47:28] <bparker> ah so action_set then
[10:47:42] <PaulWay[w]> I've set it to `actions` but yes.

[21:55:26] <knbk> zamba: you don't need to manually link the runs and result, prefetch will do that for you. You can just do `.prefetch_related("result")`

[22:04:41] <Xeago> We're setting up a new team that is coming from other languages; a concern about our current django project we have is the lack of type hints. As part of a re-architecture we'll be writing new code, and I was wondering how amicable django is to the use of typehints?
[22:05:09] <Xeago> Do certain `magics` like Model.objects.query_help have typed definitions?
[22:06:00] <knbk> zamba: yes, then you do need a Prefetch object and pass in Result.objects.order_by(...) as the queryset
[22:07:07] <zamba> hehe, this is black magic
[22:07:11] <zamba> but it works... :)
[22:07:22] <zamba> what if i want to add a "place" to each queryset object?
