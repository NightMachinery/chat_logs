[04:32:03] <winter> Hey all -- I've recently looked into adding declerative plugin support to The Lounge's NixOS module,  but I've ran into a snag involving how packages are located.  I've tried various hacky things,  but nothing really works for 100% of the edge cases.
[04:32:03] <winter> Would a patch be accepted to add a way to configure the path packages are loaded from,  instead of being hardcoded to <data dir>/packages?
[04:32:32] <winter> Thanks!

[07:52:42] <hbag> itd be cool as HELL if thelounge also had a commandline client as well as a browser-based one
[07:57:14] <hbag> or even if thelounge just ran your connections as bouncers too that you could connect to with another client AND the web client
[07:57:17] <hbag> if you get what i mean
[07:57:26] <hbag> i might be explaining badly im pretty high

[08:35:34] <dvanloon> I think I remember previous discussion that it's not feasible to make TheLounge a bouncer in and of itself
[08:35:46] <dvanloon> Due to the underlying library used
[08:36:38] <bookworm> the underlying library doesn't care much, you could in theory talk to the backend as long as you can talk websockets. However it's not a goal of TL.
[08:36:47] <bookworm> there are plenty of good CLI clients out there
[08:36:55] <bookworm> weechat / irrsi come to mind
[08:37:35] <bookworm> winter: just set the THELOUNGE_HOME and be done with it, don't see why you need to specify a path besides that?
[08:38:45] <bookworm> winter: your primary problem with "declarative" is that you need to patch the package.json file for every plugin... meaning you can't just drop a directory somewhere and that's enough, you need to add it to the file too, which is bad for package managers
[08:45:42] <dvanloon> bookworm cool cool thanks for clarifying
[08:46:11] <hbag> bookworm: well yeah but i cant connect to them as the same person if i just use weechat
[08:46:32] <bookworm> true, luckily that problem was solved ~10 years ago with znc ;)
[08:46:41] <hbag> so whats the point in using thelounge
[08:47:09] <bookworm> to have that as a single client, which is platform agnostic and syncs between all your devices
[08:47:22] <bookworm> it doesn't try to act as a bouncer
[08:47:29] <bookworm> well, not for other clients but TL that is

[21:27:14] <gues432> oh ok
[21:27:35] <Activ8> bookworm will resolve this they great, step by step

[21:37:46] <bookworm> that one is fine, how did you install it?
[21:38:02] <gues432> just fallowed the infos from the web u showed
[21:38:46] <bookworm> well what's the error if you install thelounge then?
[21:39:03] <gues432> let me try again

[21:42:56] <Activ8> that's strange on ubuntu 
[21:43:31] <gues432> lol im sweating :D cant figure  out 20 pages open lol getting confused what im doing
[21:44:08] <Activ8> gues432 are you on a windows desktop? are you in the uk?
[21:44:24] <gues432> yes uk
[21:44:33] <bookworm> it's an Ubuntu VM, the desktop really ain't important
[21:45:01] <bookworm> and for the love of god don't open up RDP to the internet if that's what you're going for
[21:45:21] <Activ8> I'm on about remote support bookworm that's why I asked this person been trying all day.  I would never ask someone to open rdp ever
[21:48:29] <gues432> on centos i managed to install it so far but was stuck at configs etc now on unbutu cant even install it :D
[21:48:56] <gues432> so i moved to unbutu though is more easy than centos :
[21:49:32] <Activ8> you know bookworm there's a lot of frustration trying to configure it when you are a new user, there's potential for support for the project
