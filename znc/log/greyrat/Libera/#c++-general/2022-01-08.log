[07:53:17] <yolo> can I de-const a const?
[07:55:55] <kalven> there's const_cast. it comes with caveats
[07:59:11] <Alipha> yolo: modifying an object that is actually const is Undefined Behavior. but if you have a const T* or const T& which refers to a T object and the object is not actually const, then using const_cast to remove the const from the pointer/reference and then modifying the object is well-defined. It's bad programming practice though
[08:02:14] <yolo> http://ix.io/3Lsr  whenever I need use posix-c api I just could not get rid of those array-decay or const-char*/char-*const cast problems

[08:07:50] <Alipha> yolo: yeah, you often run into const issues when dealing with T** and const versions thereof. go ahead and use const_cast, since execve doesn't actually modify its arguments, even though it accepts `char* const*` (a pointer to const pointers to non-const chars)
[08:09:26] <Alipha> {} void foo(const char* arg_list[]) { execve("hi", const_cast<char* const*>(arg_list), nullptr); }
[08:09:27] <geordi>  
[08:10:54] <yolo> Alipha: isn't const T* x : 'x is pointer to const T', x itself is not const, but the content(object) it points to is const, so I is not a const and de-const does not hurt?
[08:11:45] <yolo> s/so I is not/so x is not/
[08:13:32] <yolo> Alipha: thanks, that const_cast made the magic, though cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-const-cast still warns, i will just ignore that
[08:13:43] <Alipha> if you "de-const" then you'd be able to use that pointer-to-non-const to modify the const object
[08:14:17] <yolo> I just want to see 0 warnings and get a bit obssessed about that these days thanks to all these modern editor helpers.
[08:14:43] <Alipha> const int v = 3; const int* x = &v; int *y = const_cast<int*>(x); *y = 5; // modifying v, which is const, which is Undefined Behavior
[08:14:43] <yolo> Alipha: i c, thanks!
[08:15:27] <Alipha> int v = 3; const int* x = &v; int *y = const_cast<int*>(x); *y = 5; // this is legal because here v is not actually const.
[08:16:07] * yolo copies these to his little snippet collections
[08:21:24] <yolo> for those array-decay noises, can I say: "as long as the receiver(function arg uses this decayed-array) does not do sizeof() or does not care about array's, it's 100% safe", really, many a time I just want to pass the starting pointer of the array(to avoid a copy for example)
[08:21:47] <yolo> s/does not care about array's size/
[08:22:48] <yolo> in the above code, nullptr is at the end to the array, so the receiving function can detect the size of the array, just like a string has NUL
[08:24:20] <Alipha> yolo: ?? const has nothing to do with array sizes
[08:24:50] <yolo> Alipha: the post code has two FIXME, one is const, another is this frequent array-decay warning
[08:25:09] <yolo> some array-decay warning can be solved by std::array but not always
[08:25:50] <yolo> std::array, or array and size both passed over, or a reference

[09:59:24] <InPhase> In many cases, simply looping is actually clearer.
[09:59:25] <ville> InPhase: modulo gives you uneven distribution "most" of the time
[09:59:38] <InPhase> ville: It gives you as even as you can get.
[09:59:49] <InPhase> ville: Division can get pretty bad in comparison.
[10:00:42] <p-i-> I don't need random. Actual problem is that I have 100 signals, and I want to set up say 50 websockets where each websocket contains 10 signals. So each signal should appear in 5 websockets.
[10:01:00] <p-i-> It's to combat random server latency when creating any one websocket.
[10:02:00] <p-i-> I just hash each incoming packet and store the number of times that hash has been received. If it's the first time, I cout << packet. If it's the 5th time I remove the hash from the hash/count map.

[10:03:16] <p-i-> shuffle + create vector + manual-looping using v.push_back ... this looks good enough
[10:04:55] <ville> if the latency is truly random then it doesn't matter how you distribute them on your end
[10:05:50] <p-i-> but if I had signals 0..9 on the first 5 sockets, 10..19 on the next 5, etc... this isn't resilient. If the first 5 sockets are all slow, 10 signals are gona be slow.

[10:41:49] <InPhase> p-i-: Outer iterate over source signals, inner iterate over source signal multiplicity, and maintain a next_socket index that you update with next_socket = (next_socket+1)%num_sockets;  Then rather than shuffling, you guarantee maximal spread of the multiplicities across different sockets.

The iteration approach though requires no active synchronization, and thus scales better to large socket counts and/or very fast activity such that synchronization between them is a significant penalty.

[16:43:42] <very_sneaky> sigma_: might be easier if you provide a mwe to illustrate your problem
[16:44:16] <very_sneaky> you could use godbolt.org or wandbox.org to share your code snippet

[22:49:44] <PJBoy> not just that
[22:49:59] <PJBoy> but foo<>() specifically would never call a template that does have a parameter

[22:54:23] <Guest19> yeah that I get..confused about "::type"
[22:54:32] <Guest19> and why do we qualify expression with typename
[22:54:44] <PJBoy> std::decay contains a type alias called `type`
[22:54:54] <PJBoy> << TYPE<std::decay<int>::type>
[22:54:55] <geordi> int
[22:55:25] <PJBoy> the typename is there because the compiler doesn't know that `type` is a type alias, because T1 and T2 aren't known yet
[22:55:41] <PJBoy> so by writing `typename` you're telling the compiler that it is in fact a type
[22:55:56] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[22:56:18] <PJBoy> normally it defaults to thinking that `expr<template_parameter>::nnn` is a variable
[22:57:09] <PJBoy> the purpose of `decltype(true ? a : b)` is to get the "common type" of T1 and T2
[22:57:12] <Guest19> ah i see..as if we are accessing a member variable
[22:57:17] <PJBoy> exactly
[22:57:23] <Guest19> but we are telling compiler NO, it's a "type"
[22:57:29] <PJBoy> precisely
[22:57:30] <Guest19> like class/struct/in-built type
[22:57:55] <PJBoy> they eventually added std::decay_t, which solves the problem of needing to write typename

[22:58:07] <Guest19> but coming back to decltype
[22:58:17] <PJBoy> so `auto max (T1 a, T2 b) -> std::decay_t<decltype(true?a:b)>`
[22:58:18] <Guest19> true? always will give a which has type T1
[22:58:31] <PJBoy> nah, the true bit is unimportant
[22:58:34] <Guest19> so how is it a "common" type
[22:58:40] <PJBoy> the result of a ternary expression is the common type
[22:58:47] <PJBoy> because that's the only thing that could ever normally make sense
[22:58:53] <Guest19> ah gotcha
[22:59:05] <Guest19> so it's a "hack" to just get the common type of 2 unknown types
[22:59:11] <PJBoy> this is a hacky way of writing std::common_type_t<T1, T2>
[22:59:13] <PJBoy> yeah
[22:59:53] <PJBoy> and the decay is there because return values get decayed
[23:00:01] <PJBoy> decay being things like array -> pointer decay
[23:00:07] <PJBoy> function reference -> function pointer decay
[23:00:46] <Guest19> so this is how I am "visualizing it" - 1) use ternary exp trick to get common type 2) std::decay<common type> creates class like "class Decay { realtype type}" 3) we tell compiler to access the type field but treat it like an actual type
[23:01:07] <Guest19> got it..the book says int refrerence -. int decay but I get it
[23:01:10] <PJBoy> so all in all this is equivalent to the return type of `auto max(T1 a, T2 b) { return true ? a : b; }`

[23:03:12] <Guest19> but is this decay recursive when used with auto ?
[23:03:32] <PJBoy> the auto in trailing return types is just a part of the syntax

[23:14:47] <PJBoy> yeah cppreference, and slowly getting to know how to navigate it
[23:14:53] <LordKalma> and the most important think you *have* to know:
[23:15:03] <LordKalma> C++ is a dumpster fire, we're all masochists
[23:15:06] <Guest19> hahaha
[23:15:07] <PJBoy> like "oh I wonder how to do explicit instantiation, I remember where that was in cppreference"

[23:15:35] <Guest19> Btw I saw this nice lil library : https://github.com/andsmedeiros/fuss. I wanted to understand the implementation and hence I am on this template journey
[23:15:49] <PJBoy> or "how do bitshifts work w.r.t. signed parameters again? oh that was in the arithmetic operations section"
[23:15:59] <Guest19> all those "using" + iterators + "..." confuse the heck out of me :S
[23:16:47] <PJBoy> you should know the `using` for type aliases at least
[23:17:17] *** Quits: __dev (~sys@user/dev/x-7984917) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:17:18] <PJBoy> it's the same as `typedef`, but with the order reversed and with an `=` token
[23:17:44] <Guest19> yes that I am aware of...but the whole recursive thing inside the struct
[23:17:53] <ville> { int typedef x; }
[23:17:54] <geordi>  
[23:17:59] <ville> reverse that!
[23:18:13] <PJBoy> I keep forgetting that's possible hahaha
[23:18:16] <Guest19> like if you see a code, you can kind of understand what it does. But I am lacking template related skills
[23:18:29] <Guest19> to understand the implementation
[23:18:33] <ville> it's completely _obvious_ that should be possible!
[23:18:47] <PJBoy> so the other form of `using` is for exposing functions from the base class
[23:19:11] <PJBoy> the base classes there are `shouter<T_message>` and `shouter<T_rest ...>`
[23:19:17] <PJBoy> and the functions are `listen` etc.
[23:19:44] <PJBoy> so those lines are just saying "I have `listen` overloads"
[23:20:00] <PJBoy> "here's where they will get directed too [points to base classes]"
[23:20:28] <PJBoy> the ... is where thing get complicated
[23:20:28] <Guest19> but
[23:20:36] <Guest19> there's struct and class with same name
[23:20:44] <Guest19> and struct is inheriting with class from same name
[23:20:51] <Guest19> + throw in templates and ...
[23:21:09] <PJBoy> class templates instantiated with different template arguments are different classes
[23:21:18] <PJBoy> like how vector<int> and vector<float> are different
[23:21:37] <PJBoy> vector<int> could be derived from vector<float> if it really wanted to
[23:21:37] <Guest19> true
[23:22:21] <PJBoy> tuple is probably the better example
[23:22:42] <PJBoy> tuple<int, float, string> could be derived from tuple<int, float>, which itself is derived from tuple<int>
[23:22:54] <PJBoy> each step adding a member or whatever
[23:23:08] <Guest19> yeah that's better
[23:23:08] <PJBoy> and that's the kind of thing this class template is doing
[23:23:30] <PJBoy> `class shouter<T_message>` being the base case for recursion
[23:23:39] <PJBoy> like how tuple<int> is resolved as the base case

[23:26:24] <Guest19> I kinda understand..but having struct and class with same names is allowed?
[23:26:36] <PJBoy> oh uh
[23:27:14] <PJBoy> !struct
[23:27:15] <nolyc> The only difference between classes and structs is that the former default to private members and bases, while the latter default to public members and bases.
[23:28:03] <Guest19> uh that I know
[23:28:16] <PJBoy> you don't have to be consistent about which one you choose
[23:28:59] <Guest19> but my doubt was having struct and class with same name
[23:30:06] <PJBoy> { Foo x; struct Foo& a = x; class Foo& b = x; cout << TYPE(x), TYPE(a), TYPE(b); } struct Foo; class Foo {};
[23:30:07] <geordi> lvalue Foo, lvalue Foo, lvalue Foo
[23:30:37] <PJBoy> absolutely no requirement to be consistent about whether you spell class or struct
[23:31:03] <PJBoy> I would go as far as to say that `class` is a useless keyword
[23:33:15] <Guest19> err I must be doing something silly : https://wandbox.org/permlink/v5eRDkVCc9mkY1Nj
[23:43:26] <Guest19> PJBoy : what am I understanding wrong :S
[23:46:05] <PJBoy> you're defining foo twice
[23:46:11] <PJBoy> can only define things once
[23:47:09] <PJBoy> {} struct A {}; class A {};
[23:47:09] <geordi> error: redefinition of 'class A'
[23:47:14] <PJBoy> {} struct A {}; struct A {};
[23:47:14] <geordi> error: redefinition of 'struct A'
[23:47:17] <Guest19> yes my bad. I think it's template so same names are allowed
[23:47:26] <Guest19> like  you mentioned,it's base case
[23:47:40] <PJBoy> if it were a template taking the same template parameters, you'd get the same error
[23:47:43] <Guest19> I imagine same like factorial template.. we would have same names, one for base case and one for recursive calls
