[20:20:56] <ThePendulum> I almost didn't pick up but they happened to call seconds after I ordered some food, thought maybe it was the food shop calling about a problem

[21:08:58] <skye0> hope that i'll be successful for my interviews and i can quit this job. at least personal issues with my next job will be less of a problem I hope
[21:14:52] <ThePendulum> do others find them scary? did you bring it up with hr?
[21:15:12] <ThePendulum> but yeah, hope something better comes along

[23:32:04] <Hawker> what are your opinions on piracy?
[23:32:31] <joepie91> piracy is fine, actually
[23:32:36] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\​_o< QUA​CK!
[23:32:40] <joepie91> ,bef
[23:32:40] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 4.441 seconds! You have made friends with 222 ducks in #datahoarder.
[23:32:45] <skye0> a necessary evil in this DRM-encumbered age
[23:32:45] <joepie91> in and of itself it doesn't really have a moral component
[23:32:52] <skye0> when you can't even keep the shit you pay for
[23:32:52] <joepie91> it's just a thing you Do
[23:32:56] <joepie91> what matters are the reasons why
[23:33:01] <skye0> did recently buy a couple of halo infinite songs though, thankfully DRM-free
[23:33:18] <skye0> it is rare that i come across such songs for anything these days
[23:33:24] <joepie91> and that's ultimately going to be a personal case-by-case decision
[23:34:09] <joepie91> for example, I'll happily buy DRM-free things, but if something is only available with DRM, then fuck them, I'm not going to pay to "buy" something that can be taken away from me at any time for any reason and that I don't have control over, so then I will pirate it
[23:34:31] <joepie91> other people may have different ethical considerations, eg. not giving money to specific publishers
[23:34:55] <joepie91> the "pirating" component of it is just the means, in and of itself it has no moral value
[23:36:18] <skye0> yup, even without the DRM problem, it won't make a dent to pirate from a big record label as much as, say, an artist just getting into the music industry (and hopefully not embracing DRM-locked services like exclusively putting their music on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal or similar)
